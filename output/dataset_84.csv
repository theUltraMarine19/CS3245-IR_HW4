   JUDGMENT1. The plaintiff by way of statement of claim brings proceedings for damages for defamation for an article published in The Daily Telegraph on 26 October 2006. The words of the matter complained of are pleaded as conveying the following imputations: 
     
     (a) The plaintiff took part in an alcohol incident which caused his contract to be terminated (paragraphs 1, 2, 9, 10, 11, 14 and 25). 
      
     (b) The plaintiff was unfit to be a rugby league football player with South Sydney because of his consumption of alcohol (paragraphs 1, 2, 9, 10, 11, 14, 25, 38 and 39). 
      
     (c) The plaintiff consumed alcohol to such an extent that his contract was terminated (paragraphs 1, 2, 9, 10, 11, 14 and 25). 
      
     (d) The plaintiff has became an anti-social menace because of his consumption of alcohol (paragraphs 1, 2, 9, 10, 11, 14, 25, 38 and 39). 
    2. I note that imputation (c) is a “fall-back” to imputation (a).3. The imputations are objected to on the basis of form and capacity. I will deal first with the issue of capacity, since it is easier to do so.4. The matter complained of contains the following: 
     
      
     “During the past two seasons, the Rabbitohs have been plagued by a series of alcohol related incidents – leading to the sacking of two promising players. 
      
      
     Local junior Mick Moran had his contract terminated for disciplinary reasons late in the season, with alcohol believed to be a contributing factor. 
      
      
     In 2005 winger Roy Bell was sacked after a drink-driving conviction.” 
    5. The matter complained of goes on to talk about one of the Rabbitohs’ directors questioning the role of alcohol and being stunned to find that footballers who use their bodies as a means of income would drink, talks about the dangers of alcohol, and goes on to state that it does not make sense that people who rely on their body for their employment to abuse it. It talks also about the dangers of drinking culture.6. It is asserted that imputation (a) cannot arise because of the fact that it is said that alcohol was only “believed to be a contributing factor” (in paragraph 10).7. In paragraph 9, and indeed throughout the matter complained of, it is made clear that this is an article about players with drink problems and, in particular, that there has been the sacking of two promising players, one of whom is the plaintiff, because the Rabbitohs “have been plagued by a series of alcohol related incidents”.8. True it is that the matter complained of goes on to say that alcohol was “believed to be a contributing factor”, but it is quintessentially a jury question as to whether the jury would reject the imputation that his participation in an alcohol incident caused his contract to be terminated. The text is, at its lowest, inconsistent. At its highest, given the way in which this is placed in the context of an article which makes it clear that there is a serious drinking problem and that players are being sacked for it, it may be that the jury does not have the problems that Mr Hmelnitsky considers they would have.9. On any test in relation to the conveying of imputations, whether the General Steel test (General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) (1964) 112 CLR 125) or the more restrictive test which is asserted to be applicable by reason of the Court of Appeal’s recent decision in Malcolm v Nationwide News Pty Limited [2007] NSWCA 254, this is an imputation which by reason of its context in the matter complained of, and the bald statement in paragraph 9, is one which ought to go to the jury. 10. Similarly, imputation (b) is an imputation which arises from the same portion of the matter complained of. I shall shortly deal with an objection as to form. It is asserted that imputation (a) and (b) do not differ in substance. Imputation (a) is an act, whereas imputation (b) is a condition, and for the reasons explained by Hunt J in Singleton v John Fairfax (20 February 1980, Supreme Court of New South Wales, unreported), an imputation conveying a condition and an imputation conveying an act can be pleaded without there being a complaint that they do not differ in substance. In fact, there is a difference in substance, in that one imputation asserts he took part in an alcohol incident, whereas the other is a general imputation of a condition of unfitness to be a rugby league football player at all.11. There is an objection to imputation (d) on the basis that this imputation is incapable of arising. The matter complained of says, at paragraphs 38-39:  
     
      
     “Alcohol is an addictive drug that has caused devastating headlines for various players, including some at Souths, and for the game overall.  
      
      
     It’s the sport’s biggest anti-social menace.” 
    12. Mr Hmelnitsky submits that the anti-social menace is alcohol, not the players, which is redolent of the argument of the gun control lobby, that it is not the guns that cause problems, it is people. Obviously what is being referred to here is the “devastating headlines” for “players” at Souths (which includes the plaintiff) and for the game overall as a result, and it is in my view a jury question as to whether or not the “It’s” is a reference to the plaintiff, or to merely the publicity about the plaintiff. In any event, it is my view that it is not drawing an inference on an inference, to assert that the jury would need to take several steps in order to arrive at this result.13. Accordingly, it is my view that this imputation is conveyed and is not defective in form.14. Accordingly, the orders that I make are as follows:(1) Imputations (a), (b), (c) and (d) will go to the jury, with imputation (c) as a fall-back to imputation (a).(2) The defendant pay the plaintiff’s costs.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Guanglong Nong appears for sentence today after having pleaded guilty at an early stage to an offence of knowingly taking part in the cultivation of a large commercial quantity of cannabis by enhanced indoor means. That is a relatively new offence created as a result of community concern of high quality cannabis being grown in indoor locations, that high quality cannabis having high concentrations of tetrahydrocannabinol, and thus causing more harm to the community than more traditional methods of cannabis cultivation. 2 Not only was the offence created but it carries with it a standard non parole period of ten years. Both the creation of the offence and the relatively standard non parole period are clearly an indication of the seriousness with which offences of this type are to be considered. 3 I will say at once that the authorities on which the Crown and Mr Brassil rely would perhaps suggest that the legislature’s intention has not yet been met.4 The offender was one of a group of people who were involved in the cultivation of 227 cannabis plants at premises in Bexley. The offender was the subject of surveillance which indicated that he had attended this location at various times and telephone intercepts disclosed that as far back as 20 December 2008, that is, well before the plants were harvested in February 2009, the offender was visiting the premises for the purposes of cultivating cannabis plants. Specifically what he did cannot be determined precisely, except that in the middle of February 2009 a covertly installed listening device revealed that the offender was participating in the cutting and watering of plants. A significant matter is that whilst plants were harvested later on that month the offender did not attend and indeed declined to do so in conversations covertly recorded by police.5 In assessing the objective gravity of the offender's conduct, I take into account that he has pleaded guilty to an offence of being knowingly concerned, that the quantity was just over the large commercial quantity, and that his involvement was relatively limited. Mr Brassil also relied on the circumstance that ninety of the plants were in propagating trays and were thus were far from mature, but I do not regard that as a significant mitigating feature at all. After all it was everyone’s intention that the smaller plants would grow, indeed that is why they were being cultivated. Nevertheless I am satisfied that I should accept the submission made by both the Crown and Mr Brassil that the offender's conduct falls significantly below the middle of the range of objective gravity for the reasons I have identified. Of course the standard non parole period is not of direct application because of the offender's plea of guilty but it remains as a significant guidepost to the sentences that should be imposed. As I began these remarks on sentence there is clearly an intention by the legislature to treat offences of this kind very seriously indeed. 6 The offender was born in 1971 in China. He came to Australia about nine years ago but precisely what he has done since then is difficult to determine. He told Probation and Parole authorities that he had been living with his wife, for about four years. Prison records suggest that she appears to visit him once a month, the relative infrequency of visits being attributed to the distance that she has to travel. He, importantly, has no criminal history in Australia and, in a letter written to me, he denies that he had a criminal history in China. I will sentence him on the basis that therefore this is his first criminal offence. His English skills are limited, although he is apparently studying whilst in gaol, and working well in the laundry department. His pre-custody employment could not be verified, although he claimed to have had some periods of work assembling furniture and delivering furniture. His motivation for committing this offence he suggested, was that he had incurred gambling debts and that he was in the process of paying those off by working as he did for the other men more seriously involved in this offence. 7 On of those was sentenced by his Honour Judge Norrish QC on 24 September this year. When the matter was first mentioned before me this morning I raised with the parties whether it should not be Judge Norrish who should sentence this offender. However enquiries of his Honour’s associate revealed that his Honour was not in a position to sentence Mr Nong until some four weeks hence, and in view of Mr Brassil telling me that he was going to submit that the time which his client had served on remand was sufficient as a non-parole period I decided to hear the matter. I was assisted by Judge Norrish’s remarks on sentence which he revised very quickly for the assistance of other judges who would be sentencing other people involved in the enterprise. 8 It is of course important that I give effect to the principle of parity. This offender should not consider that he has a justifiable sense of grievance when he compares the sentence imposed on him with the sentence imposed on Mr Li by his Honour Judge Norrish. I note that consideration is being given to the possibility of a Crown appeal. I took that possibility into account in determining whether I would hear the matter today or whether I would list the matter before Judge Norrish, but because, if there was to be a Crown appeal it would not be heard for some time, and because of the submission that was ultimately made to me by Mr Brassil concerning the length of the time his client had served on remand, I decided that there would be no point in delaying matters until the Crown had decided whether it was going to appeal. 9 I do note however that the solicitor appearing before Judge Norrish pointed out to his Honour the need to not only say that conduct was above or below the middle of the range but also to specify how far above or below particular offending is.10 The issue of parity has weighed heavily upon me. It is clearly the case that disparity in sentencing is apt to lead to a lack of confidence in the judicial process. As the High Court said in Lowe, disparity in sentencing is a badge of unfairness and public confidence in the administration of justice would be damaged if it was thought that the length of sentence that an offender would receive was affected by the identity of the judicial officer imposing that sentence. For that reason I will impose a sentence on this offender which is much less than I would have imposed had I not been constrained by the principal of parity. If, of course, if a Crown appeal is lodged and succeeds, then the basis of my lenient sentence would at least partially disappear. 11 Of course the offender pleaded guilty at any early stage and he is therefore entitled to a sentence which is twenty-five per cent less than it would otherwise have been. He has expressed his remorse in a letter to me, although I note there was no sworn evidence given to that effect. I cannot find he has good prospects of rehabilitation. His involvement in gambling is of course a matter of concern, and the absence of any reliable information as to what he has done in the past, and the absence of evidence from him as to what he plans to do in the future, are impediments to me finding that he has good prospects of rehabilitation. 12 Mr Brassil asks, as I said before, that I fashion a sentence such that his client has effectively served any non parole period which I would have imposed. I do not consider that I should accept that submission, although, as will be soon revealed, the extra period that the offender will have to spend in custody is not all that significant. 13 I make a finding of special circumstances; this is the offender’s first time in custody. I consider that he would benefit from the supervision of Probation and Parole Service on his release from custody. I note that that will be difficult, given the language barrier, but that of course is not a matter which I can really take into account in a matter adverse to the offender. If the Service is unable to effectively supervise the offender because it does not have the resources to deal with an offender who does not speak English well, that is scarcely the offender’s fault.14 The sentence I impose on Mr Nong is as follows:15 I set a non parole period of twenty months to date from 3 March 2009. It will expire on 2 November 2010. I set an additional term of a further twenty months, making a total overall sentence of three years and four months. The offender is eligible to be released to parole on 2 November 2010.

     Judgment 
    [1] The plaintiff brings proceedings for defamation pursuant to the Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) for three publications. The first matter complained of[2] On 13 March 2006 the second defendant, the Chief Executive Officer of the first defendant, instructed the first defendant’s media manager to send an email to Mr Ray Hadley, a journalist, and other media outlets. The text is set out in Schedule “A” to this judgment.[3] The plaintiff pleads that this publication gives rise to the following imputations: 
     
     (a) he humiliated himself by engaging in a drunken rant in a public restaurant; 
      
     (b) he is, as a radio broadcaster, disloyal to his radio station and his listeners; 
      
     (c) he is disloyal to his club, the Canterbury Bulldogs Club; 
      
     (d) he is ridiculously arrogant in that he believes John Singleton will replace Ray Hadley with him to call rugby league on 2GB radio; 
      
     (e) he was arrogantly and unfairly critical of the NRL and David Gallop; 
      
     (f) he became so drunk at a public restaurant that he engaged in loud and indiscriminating abuse; 
      
     (g) he is so arrogant that he thinks he could run the Canterbury Club and the NRL better than the incumbent chief executives. 
    The republication of the first matter complained of[4] On 13 March 2006 Mr Hadley republished the first matter complained of by publishing on radio the words set out in Schedule “B” to this judgment.[5] The plaintiff pleads that this publication gives rise to the following imputations: 
     
     (a) he humiliated himself by engaging in a drunken rant in a public restaurant; 
      
     (b) he is, as a radio broadcaster, disloyal to his radio station and his listeners; 
      
     (c) he is ridiculously arrogant in that he believes that John Singleton will replace Ray Hadley with him to call rugby leagues on 2GB radio; 
      
     (d) he is disloyal to his club. 
      
    The second matter complained of[6] On or about 10 February the first defendant posted the words set out in Schedule “C” to this judgment onto a website known as “The Kennel Website”, a website used by supporters of the Bulldogs.[7] The plaintiff pleads that this publication gives rise to the following imputations: 
     
     (a) he has failed in financial obligations to the co-stars of his radio programme on 2SM; 
      
     (b) he greedily required a fee of $50,000 to be paid to him personally to participate in a fundraising event for charity; 
      
     (c) he cannot be trusted to conduct himself appropriately as a director of the Bulldogs; 
      
     (d) he is disloyal and disrespectful to his own club and its history; 
      
     (e) he does not have any integrity or credibility; 
      
     (f) his conduct as a radio broadcaster is questionable. 
    [8] An application for leave to commence proceedings out of time in relation to the first matter complained of and republication was brought and has not been opposed by the defendants. The application before me today is an argument concerning the form and capacity of certain of the imputations. After hearing argument in the Defamation List this morning, I made the following orders: 
     
     “(1) On the application of the plaintiff (the defendant neither consenting nor opposing), the plaintiff is granted leave to commence proceedings out of time in relation to the first matter complained of. 
      
     (2) The limitation period is extended to 14 November 2008 in respect to the first matter complained of pursuant to s 56A  
     Limitation Act 
      1969 (NSW). 
      
     (3) Plaintiff’s Notice of Motion filed 6 February 2009 dismissed with costs reserved. 
      
     (4) Strike out imputations 6(a) and (f) as not differing in substance with leave to replead. 
      
     (5) Imputations 6(d) and 9(c) will go to the jury. 
      
     (6) Strike out the words “unfairly” in imputation 6(e) and grant liberty to replead the imputation. 
      
     (7) Note the defendant abandons objections to imputation 6(g). 
      
     (8) Grant the plaintiff leave to replead imputations 16(a) and (f)

    [9] These are my reasons for judgment in relation to orders (4)-(6) above, which the parties agreed I could email to them rather than have the delay of waiting for the draft of an ex tempore judgment from our overworked Court Reporting staff.The first publication[10] The defendant complains that imputations (a) and (f) do not differ in substance. They arise from the same portion of the publication (lines 3 – 6); the phrases “drunken rant” and “drunk…loud and indiscriminate abuse” are identical acts and the reference to “humiliated” in (a) is only a gloss, given that both imputations refer to this conduct being in “a public restaurant”.[11] The plaintiff contends that the concept of humiliation is enough for there to be a difference between the two.[12] However, I cannot see that the conduct in (a) is humiliating while the conduct in (f) is not. If the plaintiff wants to argue that the matter complained of infers humiliation, that can be considered in the repleaded imputation. Although Mr Dawson advised me that the Supreme Court permits overlapping imputations (as, for example, in a recent decision in Mundine v Brown (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Nicholas J, 14 April 2009, unreported)), this is a submission of limited assistance because these two imputations are identical. In Mundine the imputations were that the plaintiff was incompetent as a mental health worker while the other was not that she was incompetent, but did not perform her job in a proper fashion. These are two quite different concepts, although overlapping in the sense that they related to the performance of the plaintiff’s job as a health worker in the Aboriginal community. That is not the case here. Imputations (a) and (f) do not differ in substance, and I will strike both out, with leave to replead.[13] I will allow imputation 6(d) for the same reason as imputation 9(c), for the reasons set out in the section of this judgment relating to the challenges to the imputations in the republication.[14] Imputation 6(e) says that the plaintiff was “arrogantly and unfairly” critical of the NRL and David Gallop. Counsel for the plaintiff conceded that this was rolled-up, but submitted that this was what the article actually said and that the rolled-up imputation should be permitted.[15] The use of “fair” and “unfair” in imputations has been considered in a number of decisions, commencing with Waterhouse v Broadcasting Station 2GB Pty Ltd (1985) 1 NSWLR 58 at 73 and including Robertson v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2003] NSWSC 473 where Simpson J allowed one such imputation which connoted deceptive business practices while striking out another where the meaning was unclear. The question is whether the publication is capable of carrying an imputation of unfairness, as I noted in Rodgers v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd [2007] NSWDC 180, and that is the problem the plaintiff has here.[16] The trouble is that beyond stating the plaintiff said the NRL and David Gallop “weak as piss”, the matter complained of just says that the plaintiff “went on” about the salary cap, the judiciary and refereeing, saying he could do a better job than Gallop. Mr Dawson was unable to explain to me what would be “unfair” about “going on” about such topics. While the test for imputations on a strike-out application presents a very low bar, an imputation of “unfair” conduct is hopeless, and I strike out the word “unfairly” with leave to replead imputation 6(e).[17] The defendant abandoned objections to imputation 6(g) and this imputation will go to the jury, as will the other imputations (subject to any objections to the repleaded imputations).The republication and imputations 6(d) and 9(d)[18] Counsel for both parties agreed that these imputations stood or fell together (Palmer v Bradshaw (Supreme Court of Western Australia, Master Bredmeyer, 27 September 1991); see also Australian Defamation Law & Practice [51,120]), so it is convenient for me to deal with them at the same time.[19] The problem identified by the defendant is the word “ridiculously”. The plaintiff, however, submits that this word is necessary to distill the mocking tone of the whole of each publication.[20] There are plenty of examples of mockery in each publication. Looking at the first publication, the author says that he and his companion “had to stop ourselves from laughing” at the plaintiff’s conduct. He goes on to list what the plaintiff has done in a sneering way (noting it was “very entertaining” and that he stayed to have an extra coffee “to keep hearing his barrage” of “colourful language” and concludes “Graham is a legend! If we catch him again at the casino I’ll give you a heads up”.[21] The second publication refers to the “entertaining” contents of the email, noting that the author of it and his companion “had to stop ourselves from laughing”. Mr Hadley went on to say he didn’t think the plaintiff would be taking over his job calling the football because if Mr Hadley ever decided to call it a day he would be getting Andrew Moore, a much more talented person, to take over.[22] Each of these imputations is a “ridiculous light” imputation; in other words, the plaintiff seeks to distil a meaning that the conduct attributed to him makes him look ridiculous.[23] The famous phrase “hatred, ridicule and contempt” received insightful analysis by the Court of Appeal in Berkoff v Burchill & Anor [1996] 4 All ER 1008 where the plaintiff, a famous actor, sued a newspaper when a journalist said he was “hideously ugly”. The Court of Appeal held, by majority, that insults which did not diminish a person’s standing might not found an action for defamation, but words were capable of being defamatory if they held the plaintiff up to scorn, contempt or ridicule even if they did not impute disgraceful conduct, lack of skill or other identifiable wrongdoing. [24] A number of cases on “ridiculous light” imputations, including the landmark Australian decision of Ettingshausen v Australian Consolidated Press Ltd (1991) 23 NSWLR 443, are about football playing, but this is coincidental. If ridicule is there, the test is whether the ridicule is such that none of its contents can be taken seriously and thus no imputation (including no imputation of ridicule) could be made. In Coleman v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2003] NSWSC 564 the plaintiff sued over a satirical article imputing, in the manner of a learned treatise, whether the plaintiff’s lack of success as a prominent football coach resulted from an inadequate upbringing and early childhood traumas such as being enrolled in a child care centre by his mother (hence the heading “Coleman’s mother blamed for Souths’ disastrous year”). In striking out the actions brought by Mr Coleman and his mother, Levine J considered (at [25]) that neither the plaintiff, nor his mother, could point to imputations which an ordinary reader would consider disparaging.[25] However, that is not the case here. Each publication is presented in such a way that the plaintiff is not merely portrayed as being arrogant for thinking John Singleton will give him Ray Hadley’s job, but ridiculously and embarrassingly arrogant. [26] I reject the attack on imputation 9(c). The second publication[27] In the course of argument Mr Dawson sought leave to replead the two imputations objected to (16(a) and (f)).Costs[28] As the defendant was successful in relation to a number of the issues, I order the plaintiff pay two thirds of the defendant’s costs.Orders(1) On the application of the plaintiff (the defendant neither consenting nor opposing), the plaintiff is granted leave to commence proceedings out of time in relation to the first matter complained of.(2) The limitation period is extended to 14 November 2008 in respect to the first matter complained of pursuant to s 56A Limitation Act 1969 (NSW).(3) Plaintiff’s Notice of Motion filed 6 February 2009 dismissed with costs reserved.(4) Strike out imputations 6(a) and (f) as not differing in substance with leave to replead.(5) Imputations 6(d) and 9(c) will go to the jury.(6) Strike out the words “unfairly” in imputation 6(e) and grant liberty to replead the imputation.(7) Note the defendant abandons objections to imputation 6(g).(8) Grant the plaintiff leave to replead imputations 16(a) and (f)(9) The plaintiff pay 2/3 of the defendant’s costs.(10) Gibson DCJ to email reasons for decision to the parties today.(11) Plaintiff’s amended statement of claim in 14 days.(12) Matter stood over for further directions to Friday 15 May 2009 at 9:00am.

    I was having dinner at Star City on the weekend and noticed that former Canterbury player Graham Hughes was at the table behind me. He was having dinner with two other men who I didn’t recognise. They were all hitting the wines pretty hard and their conversation was getting louder and louder.Graham was pretty shitty and was bagging everyone. It was very entertaining and we stayed around and had an extra coffee just to keep hearing his barrage.He was having a go about being stuck at “a lowbrow radio station with no talent cohosts”, I don’t which one, and that they had “inbred listeners”. We had to stop ourselves from laughing. He then went on about Ray Hadley and how he has no credibility as a rugby league caller because he hasn’t played footy. He said that he had spoken to John Singleton about doing league on 2GB and that it would only be a matter of time.Graham than ripped into everyone at the Canterbury club. The colourful language was flying. He reckons Steve Folkes is past his time as a coach and has no control over the players. he said he was overated as a player and is overated as a coach. He thinks that George Peponis is a “halfwit, who bumbles along and that the Canterbury boss Malcolm Noad is the worst thing that has happened to the club and he would do everything he could to get rid of him. He says that the club would be better to have him as CEO and that he would do a mass cleanout.He then had a go at the NRL and David Gallop. He called them “weak as piss”and went on about the salary cap, the judiciary and referreeing. He reckons he could do a better job than Gallop. Graham is a legend!If we catch him again at the casino I’ll give you a heads up.Pete

     TRANSCRIPTION OF RAY HADLEY on 13 March 2006 
      
    I’ve got a most bizarre email from one of my listeners who writes to me from time to time and I believe him. He says a friend of mine sent this email through about a fellow at Star City Casino and I won’t name the fellow because I can’t verify it yet but I suspect it might be right, having a go at you. The fellow says that I was having dinner at Star City Casino on the weekend and he names the person who is now involved in the media was having dinner with two other men who I didn’t recognise. They were all hitting the wines pretty hard and their conversation was getting louder and louder. This particular person was giving it to everyone. It was entertaining stuff. We stayed around and had an extra coffee just to keep hearing the barrage. He spoke about working at a ‘low brow’ radio station with no talent co-hosts apparently, I don’t know who that would be referring to, we had to stop ourselves from laughing and then he went on to talk about Ray Hadley and how he has no credibility as a rugby league caller because he hasn’t actually played the game, despite the fact I am celebrating my 20th year doing it. He said that he had spoken to John Singleton about doing league on 2GB and that it would only be a matter of time. Then he ripped into a particular club that he has had an association with, talking about the coach and talking about the Chief Executive and the Chairman. Oh dear. I guess I’ll be able to ascertain whether this is correct or not by making a couple of phone calls but, ah, I don’t think he will be working here calling the football because if I ever decide to call it a day it will be Andrew Moore who will be doing it who is a much talented caller andmuch more talented than the mentioned, er, man mentioned in the email.

    GRAEME HUGHESIs this the man you want on the Board of Directors of the Canterbury Bulldogs:He is backed by Gary McIntyre, the man who ruined this great club in 2002 by rorting the salary cap.Graeme Hughes runs a radio program on 2SM where he gets paid but his co-stars don’t and then they get sacked when they complain – just ask Jimmy Smith and Paul Langmack. We don’t need a questionable director.Graeme Hughes asks for $50,000 to run a fundraising event for a rugby league charity organization, the Men Of League, when other former footballers help the Men Of League for free. He is only interested in himself.Graeme Hughes is being sued for defamation for comments he made about Dr George Peponis and Malcolm Noad. We can’t have a director who would shoot off at the mouth and the Bulldogs are then held liable.Graeme Hughes bagged the late Peter Moore when he was in charge of the Bulldogs and then tried to make good to Mr Moore’s wife after he had passed away. He need directors who are respectful of our past.When asked in 2002 to come on board and help the club after the salary cap scandal Graeme Hughes said no. He is not interested in helping the Bulldogs.We need a board that has integrity and credibility. Graeme Hughes has neither.We are at a time when the Bulldogs need stability and less controversy. Graeme Hughes creates controversy and only wants to see his name in the newspapers. You can’t vote for Graeme Hughes!!!!

   JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: I have before me two appeals relating to the conduct of two child care centres. The reason there are two appeals is that the prosecutor brought proceedings against Andrea Murray and Ammcen Pty Limited in relation to the two child care centres. Ms Murray was the sole director of Ammcem and so to that extent there is some duplication of the matters before me. The appeals have been heard together.2 Both Ms Murray and the company faced prosecution under the Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act and the Children’s Services Regulations. They arose out of breaches of the Act and Regulations at two child care centres conducted by the two appellants. One of the child care centres was at St Ives and the other at Turramurra. The charges arise out of inspections carried out by staff in February 2008 where a number of breaches of the relevant regulations were discovered. They related generally to the safety of the children attending the day care centres. Threats to the children’s safety arose from such things as there being an insufficient area for a safe fall zone. And also less clearly related to the safety, was the failure to have qualified staff on premises when there were children under the age of two present at the centre. The other threats to the safety to the children related to the cleanliness of the premises, and the plumbing at the premises. It is not necessary for me to go through each of the offences, beyond saying that the regulations were clearly designed to promote the welfare of the children attending the centre and breaches of the regulations were serious. At one stage the Magistrate expressed the preliminary view that some of the offences were of a technical nature, but after receiving submissions on the matter he withdrew from that point of view. I have to agree that none of the offences here could probably be described as technical. Each appellant was fined and costs were ordered. 3 There is a significant need to deter others who may be tempted to operate child care facilities in the way that these two premises were operated. Parents place a great deal of trust in people such as Ms Murray and her company. They expect that licensed premises such as those operated by the appellant comply with the various regulations. Parents are entitled to expect, for example, that if their child fell from some play equipment they would not fall onto a brick path. Parents are entitled to expect that dead flies and other insects are not present in the premises, and that appropriately qualified staff are present as well. It should not be for the parents to have to interrogate each staff member as to his or her qualifications. And so where child care centres are not operated in accordance with the Regulations there has in effect been a breach of the trust that the parents are entitled to place in the operators.4 It is not also a matter that involves one or two breaches of the Regulations. Many offences were committed. Of course the appellant, Ms Murray, has excuses as to why it was, for example that the gate wasn’t fixed, or the premises were not clean, or the staff were not qualified. But frankly if child care centres cannot be operated in accordance with the Regulations, then it would be better that they did not operate at all. Ms Murray says that she was simply trying to provide a service and provide employment. I suspect that Ms Murray’s main motivation of course was profit. She was running a business. And part of the costs of running that business involved complying with the Legislation and Regulations. 5 There are many child care centres throughout New South Wales and DOCS has precious few resources. Not only do parents place their trust in the child care centres, but also the community in general places their trust in the operators of child care centres. Policing individual child care centres is an expensive and time consuming task, taking resources away from other areas where DOCS operate. This is yet another reason why where breaches are detected significant punishment should follow. I take into account that the appellant has pleaded guilty. However as was pointed out, this was on the very day the matters were listed for hearing. I have also taken into account that the appellant has no prior criminal record. However, this would be almost inevitable for a prosecution of this nature given the need for the person running the centre to be licensed. 6 Ms Murray relies on the circumstance that she has lost her house, and is now on the dole. The Magistrate took her financial hardship into account. It is to be noted that the maximum penalty, for each offence, is a fine of $22,000. The Magistrate’s decision to impose significantly smaller fines demonstrates the level to which he took into account Ms Murray’s particular circumstances. 7 For those reasons the appeals are dismissed, and the orders of the Magistrate are confirmed.8 HIS HONOUR: Because there are two appeals being heard together, that order will be that Ms Murray pay the sum of $750 and Ammcen Pty Limited also pay the sum of $750, being the prosecutor’s costs of today’s appeal.

   JUDGMENT1 On 24 November last year, the victim in this matter, a man by the name of Armando Vieira went for a walk. It was about midnight. He was walking around his local neighbourhood. He was entitled to do so in safety. He was entitled to do so without being set upon by those who cared nothing for him or his rights. In the same vicinity were this offender and another man. They had one objective in mind and that was to rob Mr Vieira through the use of violence. 2 The circumstances of the offence as I am about to describe them, demonstrate significant callousness. A large part of the submissions put on behalf of the offender by Mr Jeffery related to the circumstances of this offender’s upbringing, but common humanity would suggest no matter what a person’s upbringing, it takes a particularly callous person to do what this offender did to Mr Vieira. 3 Mr Vieira first got into trouble when he saw this offender and the other man on the other side of the road. He was later pushed from behind; he fell forward and landed on his chest in a doorway. He tried to look around but was struck to his left eye. One of the two, men and it does not matter who, grabbed his neck and pushed his face into the ground. His jacket was pulled over his head so he could not see anything and whilst he was in that helpless position he was kicked a number of times. One of the men said; 
     
      
      “I want your wallet.” 
      
    and very sensibly the victim handed it over. It contained, of course, the various things that people carry in their wallets, credit cards, personal papers, some money, driver’s licence and a gold souvenir coin, all property which Mr Vieira was entitled to have, all property which the offenders wanted. 4 It was then that Mr Vieira was required to give his PIN number. He refused to tell the offenders. To this act of defiance the offenders responded by pulling him backwards and forwards and yelling;  
     
      
      “Give us the PIN number or I will kill you.” 
      
    5 Mr Vieira then gave them a number but it was, to his knowledge, the incorrect number. He was clearly hoping to minimise the consequences for him of this attack upon him. Unfortunately the offenders had other ideas. This offender, Mr Close, stayed with Mr Vieira whilst the unknown man left the vicinity intending to try and get some money out of the victim’s bank account. Fortunately all this had raised a bit of noise and a witness was woken from her sleep. She had been woken by him crying out in pain. What she saw when she looked out her window was Mr Vieira curled up in a foetal position on the ground being punched and kicked. Mr Vieira was helpless on the ground. Fortunately, what was taking place was observed by this witness who arranged for the police to be called. 6 The offender then made further demands on Mr Vieira. He firstly asked for his watch, which Mr Vieira gave him and then, and this is remarkable, demanded that Mr Vieira hand over his wedding ring. Mr Vieira did so.7 I mentioned before the callousness of this offence. This action of the offender is but a further demonstration of the way he regarded Mr Vieira. He was also required to hand over his mobile phone, which he did. At this stage the unknown man returned with the news that Mr Vieira had given them the wrong PIN number. The offenders again pulled Mr Vieira’s jacket over his head so he could not see anything, picked him up off the ground and began dragging him before they pushed him in the back so that he fell forward and hit the ground face down again. Once more they threatened to kill him, saying,  
     
      
      “Give us the right number or I will kill you.” 
      
    8 By now Mr Vieira had clearly had enough, so he gave them the correct PIN number. This time it was the offender who left to obtain money from the ATM. The unknown man remained with Mr Vieira, kicking him and holding him down with his foot on Mr Vieira’s neck, so that he was held captive in effect for ten minutes. 9 Ms Johnson, the eyewitness who I have mentioned earlier, saw that every time Mr Vieira tried to get up, the unknown man would kick him. It was at this stage that police arrived preventing any further harm being caused to Mr Vieira, although, as I will shortly set out, he had already suffered significant harm indeed. Police were able to apprehend the offender after he seems to have got bored with hiding from them. They saw, amongst other things, that the offender had blood on his clothing. It was later revealed to have matched the blood of Mr Vieira. 10 Mr Vieira was taken to hospital, where he was treated. He remained in hospital for three days. His injuries were substantial. He suffered a fractured collarbone, a fractured cheekbone and he had significant bruising to his body. The consequences for Mr Vieira are long lasting. He did not work for a full six months because of the fracture to his collar bone and he is only working now on light duties, that only being possible because he works for a family member. When he is working he can only use one arm, is still having ongoing physiotherapy and requires a further operation on his collarbone in the future. He was in pain, not surprisingly, after the attack upon him, for a significant period of time. 11 He has thus suffered financially, physically and of course emotionally. He no longer goes out on his own any more. He clearly no longer goes for a walk around his neighbourhood by himself at night. Those consequences are substantial, they are entirely foreseeable and they are consequences for which the offender must bear criminal responsibility. 12 The offender was intoxicated at the time he committed this serious offence. He told police that it came about when he ran into some bloke outside the Marrickville RSL who asked him whether he wanted to make some money. It was clear that when the offender went with this unknown man, they had in mind the clear intention to rob someone through the use of violence. They intended precisely what came about, except that they did not intend that they would get caught. 13 The offender is still a young man but he has offences of violence on his criminal history, those offences also occurring in the context of excessive consumption of alcohol. The offender was brought up in Sydney. He is an Aboriginal. He has a number of siblings and half siblings. He told a psychologist that his childhood was difficult and it was characterised by his father’s alcohol abuse, his mother’s cannabis abuse and domestic violence perpetrated by his father against his mother. 14 His parents separated when he was about twelve and he went to live with his mother and his siblings in Coffs Harbour. He had infrequent contact with his father until he was about fifteen, when the family returned to Sydney and he began to see him regularly again. He then moved out of home when he was about sixteen and lived with his partner, with whom he has had two children. That relationship broke up and it appears to have had an affect of some consequence upon the offender. He began committing offences, which resulted in him going to gaol. He has worked from time to time but clearly inhibiting him from gaining employment is the fact that he did not complete high school but was expelled in year eleven for fighting. 15 Mr Jeffery appropriately relied on the principles to be found in the decision of R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58. It is important to recognise that some people have an upbringing which makes it harder for them to resist the excessive consumption of alcohol. In a family as the offender experienced where domestic violence and alcohol abuse were regular events, the decisions that faced the child in those circumstances are not as easy as those faced by children brought up in households without those problems. 16 Mr Close senior, that is the offender’s father, gave evidence. He acknowledged that he abused alcohol but to his credit, has been sober for many years now. He clearly tried to take some of the blame for his son’s conduct upon himself but it has to be recognised that ultimately the decision to do what the offender did was his. The decision to rob the victim was the offender’s and the decision to beat him whilst he did so was the offender’s as well. Although of course I will make allowances for the circumstances of the offender’s upbringing, as I said before, common humanity would suggest that no matter what a person’s upbringing, it takes a particularly callous person to do what the offender did.17 This offence carries with it a standard non-parole period of seven years. That is not of direct application because the offender pleaded guilty in the Local Court. Indeed, he told police on the night of his arrest that he would be doing so. Nevertheless, despite the plea of guilty, the standard non-parole period remains as a guidepost to the sentence I should impose in the present case. The offender’s plea of guilty is to be rewarded by a discount on the sentence I would otherwise have imposed of twenty-five per cent, reflecting the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty. 18 I am satisfied that as far as the objective gravity of the offence is concerned, it is significantly above the middle of the range of offences of this type. I say this, even acknowledging of course that grievous bodily harm and the offence being committed in company, are elements of the offence itself, but it is to be borne in mind that the offender was kicked whilst he was helpless, lying in a foetal position on the ground. He represented no threat to the offenders at all, the only reason they beat him was for money. 19 The offence occurred over a lengthy period of time. On two occasions the victim was held through the use of violence, whilst one of the men went to check whether the victim had supplied the right PIN number. Not only was there actual violence but also threats were made to the victim that he would be killed. It is no doubt a matter of some significant consequence to him that the offenders and in particular this offender, took his wedding ring. Finally, when assessing the objective seriousness, it is to be remember that the victim has significant ongoing consequences facing him, all flowing from his decision to go for a walk one night, something of course he should have been able to do without being attacked by those intent on the thuggish behaviour that I have outlined. 20 I mention that this event was committed whilst the offender was intoxicated but this is not a matter of mitigation. The offender was clearly aware of what was possibly going to happen when he got drunk, that finding being made in view of the relationship between his criminal history and alcohol as revealed in the evidence today. The question of his rehabilitation is therefore tied up with the question of whether he can overcome his alcohol problem, as his father has been able to. For that reason I will make a finding of special circumstances in the offender’s favour. If he can deal with his alcohol problem, that will help to deal with his criminal behaviour. 21 It is of most concern that the offender has displayed a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law, usually involving violence to strangers. 22 People like Mr Vieira need to be protected from people like the offender. There needs to be a substantial component of general deterrence as well as a substantial component of retribution in the sentence I will shortly announce upon the offender. My sentence needs to mark in a very concrete way, just how wrong the offender’s conduct was. It was, I regret to say, despicable. 23 The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of four and a half years to date from 24 November 2008 and a head sentence of seven years. This means that the offender is eligible to be released to parole on 23 May 2013. It also means that I am not able to make an order for compulsory drug treatment.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: The offender appears for sentence today after having pleaded guilty to two serious drug offences. The first was an offence of knowingly taking part in the a of 141 grams of cocaine which took place between 15 November and 22 November, 2006. The second offence was one of supplying prohibited drug, namely 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, a drug commonly known as ecstasy. He supplied 122.4 grams of that drug on 22 March, 2007. 2 The offender pleaded guilty at an early stage to both of those matters and so is entitled to a twenty-five per cent discount for the utilitarian value of that plea. Although he was indicted before me today that seems to have come about because of an error in the committal charges and it may well be that that error was that he was in fact committed for sentence on the aggravated form of supplying the ecstasy tablets. The court papers reveal that he got a court attendance notice for supplying a commercial quantity of that drug. In fact 122.4 grams of MDMA is just short of the commercial quantity.3 The two separate offences involve the offender acting as a middle man in drug supply activities. On the first occasion he was the middle man between a man by the name of Shamoon who was a drug supplier and a man by the name of Daher who was anxious to obtain drugs. 4 The police facts set out in some detail the activities of Mr Shamoon and more importantly of course the activities of the offender as he set about arranging the supply of drugs by Shamoon and the payment of money by Daher . It is clear that the offender was an enthusiastic participant in the arrangements in which he was involved. It is clear also that Mr Shamoon was a fairly high level drug dealer and that the particular transaction that the offender was involved in represented a significant breach of the law. I presume from the quantity involved that it was intended to supply Mr Daher with 141 grams of cocaine, so that he in turn could on supply that drug. This is not a case where the offender was simply supplying low level street users with drugs but he was an important middle man in the drug supply hierarchy.5 On 22 March, 2007 the offender committed his second offence when he supplied more than 600 MDMA tablets to a man by the name of Berger. Again, there were a number of arrangements made leading up to that supply, involving telephone calls between the offender and Mr Berger. Of course the offender had to obtain the drugs himself. He initially sought 1000 tablets but ultimately arrangements were made to supply Berger with 600. In fact what was ultimately supplied was slightly more than 600 tablets, indeed 658. 6 When the offender was arrested on 21 April, 2007 a number of telephones were seized from his residence as well as two sets of scales. He initially denied matters to police, but it appears that after being played numerous telephone calls the offender saw the strength of the case against him and pleaded guilty, as I have said, at the earliest opportunity.7 This is not the first occasion where the offender has supplied drugs either. He was dealt with in 2000 for supplying a prohibited drug and received a s 9 bond. It is apparent that he did not comply with conditions of that bond and so he was called up and dealt with in the Local Court for that breach ultimately being fined $750.00.8 It is clear that the offender is a significant drug user. It is submitted on his behalf that what motivated him to get involved in these two very serious drug supplies was the prospect of getting drugs for his own use. It is clear also that the offender was substantially involved in drug supply operations and a lengthy full-time custodial sentence is thus required. 9 The offender was born in Iraq, he had an unremarkable upbringing in that country until at the age of eighteen he was conscripted into the army. He was a Catholic and thus suffered discrimination from the mainly Muslim armed forces. As part of his service in the army he was captured and as a result of the experiences he then suffered, it is thought that he may have suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. He escaped to Turkey and came to Australia in 1991. He has family members throughout the world, being the fourth of twelve or sixteen siblings, but no other members of his family live in Australia. He has worked in Australia in various positions according to a psychological report tendered on his behalf. He formed a relationship with a woman and hopes to marry her in the future. What is most important of course, however, is that he developed a significant drug use which led ultimately to him committing these offences. 10 The Probation and Parole Service prepared a report at the request of the court. There was much in it which was not to the offender’s credit. Accordingly, the author of the report, Miss Perry, was called by the Crown at the request of Mr Archibald who appeared for Mr Ziya. It was put to Miss Perry that she had misunderstood a number of things which the offender had said to her. In response Miss Perry referred on occasions to notes that she had made, either at the time, of or soon after, the interview. Given the nature of the statements which were challenged by Mr Archibald in cross-examination it is difficult to see how Miss Perry could have misunderstood what the offender was saying. When the offender gave evidence he denied some things which had not even been put to Miss Perry. I have no hesitation in preferring, beyond reasonable doubt if necessary, the evidence of Miss Perry. She was clearly acting as an officer of the Probation and Parole Service and was thus focussed on obtaining from the offender, information as set out in her report. She was not a casual participant in a conversation, but was actually interviewing the offender knowing that her conclusions would be put before the court. Her report is supported by the notes to which I have earlier made reference. All the cross-examination of Miss Perry has done was to actually put the offender in an even worse light, as she expanded on some brief comments she made in the report by reference to the notes she made.11 It is clear, as a result of that finding, that there needs to be a substantial component of personal deterrence in the present sentences. I am satisfied that the offender does not truly appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct. I am satisfied that he said things to Miss Perry along the lines of: well if he did not supply drugs, someone else would and that it was the fault of Australia for allowing him to supply drugs in the first place. The attitude displayed by the offender to Miss Perry is very worrying indeed.12 I am not satisfied that the offender is remorseful at all. There is no acknowledgement from him anywhere at the harm that his conduct has caused, or that the harm that drug supply offences can result in. Nor am I able to find that he has prospects of rehabilitation whether good or otherwise. I cannot find it is unlikely that he will offend in the future.13 The Crown and Mr Archibald together say there is contrition in the plea of guilty, but it must be remembered that this was a very strong Crown case against the appellant involving intercepted telephone calls and surveillance revealing with almost complete precision the nature of the offender’s wrongdoing.14 These two offences were completely separate, both in time, but also in circumstances. They involve different drugs, different parties and so it is quite inappropriate that there be anything other than accumulation of sentence. This will not be total accumulation, to give affect to the principle of totality. The offender was arrested on 21 April, 2007 and it is appropriate that the effective sentence commence on that day.15 For the first count on the indictment the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of one and half years to date from 21 April, 2007 and a head sentence of two and half years.16 On count two on the indictment the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of two years to date from 21 April, 2008 and a head sentence of three years. 17 The overall sentence is thus one of four years with a non-parole of three years and it will be clear I have made no finding of special circumstances. There are matters capable of amounting to special circumstances, but the effective non-parole which I have just announced is the shortest which I consider properly reflects the circumstances of this case.

   JUDGMENT1 June Alice McDonald, then aged seventy-six, went to the Moama Bowling Club for Christmas lunch on 25 December 2004. She had not been to the club on any previous occasion. She was accompanied by her husband, her daughter Deborah Ryan, her son-in-law and her two grandchildren.2 They arrived at twelve noon for the first luncheon sitting at the club. Having eaten, the plaintiff stood to leave. She decided to attend the toilet before leaving. This required the plaintiff to walk a short distance from her table and descend a flight of three steps. She fell on these steps and suffered significant injury to her right upper arm and shoulder. Her right arm is immobilised. She is right hand dominant.NEGLIGENCE3 The plaintiff claimed that she fell because she did not see the steps on approach. She claimed that the defendant was responsible for her fall on a number of bases summarised as follows: 
     
      
      1 Failing to warn her of the presence of the stairs. 
      
     
     
      
      2 Providing lighting that was inadequate or switching off the lights. 
      
     
     
      
      3 The absence of a visible handrail to alert her to the presence of the stairs. 
      
     
     
      
      4 Allowing her view of the stairs to be obscured by the presence of too many patrons in the vicinity of the stairs and the positioning of dining tables close to the stairs. 
      
    4 The defendant denied that it was in breach of its duty to the plaintiff. It claimed that it was absolved from liability by the provisions of ss 5B, 5F and 5I of the Civil Liability Act 2002. Alternatively the defendant claimed significant contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff.5 Evidence that was not in dispute established the following.6 Christmas Day was a very busy day at the Moama Bowling Club. In order to cater for all of the persons wishing to dine there, it was necessary to arrange two luncheon sittings.7 The Jubilee Room was set up for this purpose. This room occupied three levels. Patrons entered at the first level. A number of short staircases led to the second level where the plaintiff dined. The third level normally used as a dance floor was accessed by further short staircases. In addition, there was a stage at one end of the room, used in ordinary circumstances by bands and entertainers.8 There was in evidence a report of Mr Dohrmann marked as exhibit O which contained a number of photographs of the staircase involved in the plaintiff’s accident. Mr Dohrmann reported that the stairs complied with the requirements of the Building Code of Australia in respect of dimensions. One handrail was provided on the right hand side of patrons as they descended the stairs that also complied with the Building Code of Australia.9 Metal strips were positioned at the edge of the nosings of each step. Lights were positioned in the wall adjacent to each step on the left hand side of descending patrons.10 The plaintiff, in her evidence, stated that changes had been made to the steps between 2004 and 2007 when the photographs were taken. There was evidence from Mr Evans, a former employee of the club, that no changes had been made.11 This basically unchallenged evidence leads to the following factual findings: 
     
      
      1 There was no evidence of changes to the Jubilee Room or the various staircases between 25 October 2004 and September 2007 when the photographs in the Dohrmann report were taken. 
      
     
     
      
      2 I accept the plaintiff’s evidence that she did not see the staircase leading from the second level of the Jubilee Room to the dance floor. I find that this was the cause of her fall. 
      
     
     
      
      3 The staircase upon which the plaintiff fell complied with the technical requirements of the  
      Building Code of Australia 
      . 
      
     
     
      
      4 In determining the issue of negligence, it is necessary that the plaintiff persuade me that the defendant did not take reasonable precautions against the foreseeable risk that the plaintiff might suffer harm when using the staircase on which she fell. 
      
    12 The defendant relied upon the evidence in the Dohrmann report that the stairs complied with the Building Code requirements, that the photos indicated a high level of visibility of the stairs, and the absence of evidence of a history of falls or accidents involving the staircase. It argued that the risk was obvious and inherent and urged that I take account of the plaintiff’s concession that she would have seen the stairs had she been looking.13 Notwithstanding these factors to which the defendant pointed, I have concluded that on 25 December 2004 the defendant did not manage the premises appropriately and did not take reasonable precautions to protect the plaintiff against that risk of harm for the following reasons:14 The capacity to see the staircase was important in alerting a patron to the need to descend the stairs and ascend a staircase on the other side of the room in order to access the toilets. Without that view a patron might be excused for expecting to access the toilets on the same level, or at most by using one ascending staircase.15 There were three features present on that day that had the potential to affect the plaintiff’s capacity to appreciate the presence of the stairs on which she fell. They were the lighting of the premises; the numbers of persons in the premises; and the arrangement of the dining tables.16 In respect of lighting conditions, Mr Evans, the former functions coordinator for the defendant, agreed that controls for the Jubilee Room allowed adjustments to be made to the lighting provided in the room. These controls allowed the lights to be dimmed as necessary to set a particular mood and for persons on the stage to be spot-lit. 17 The plaintiff said the lighting in the area where she had lunch was dull or delicate. Her daughter, Mrs Ryan, said that it was soft and romantic and not bright. Mr Smith, an apparently independent witness, said the lighting in this area was reasonably bright.18 All agreed that the area of the dance floor was in darkness and that a piano player providing entertainment on the stage was in spotlight. 19 The plaintiff claimed not to have seen the metal strips on the nosings of the steps or the wall lights. She stated that the area of the stairs was dark.20 Mrs Ryan went to the plaintiff’s assistance after the fall. She said the stairs were in darkness to the point where she travelled down them sideways until she was able to hold onto the handrail.21 Mr Smith saw the plaintiff fall and went to her assistance. He jumped down the steps because he said this was a quicker way to descend them. He described the steps as reasonably dark and in shadow but said he had no difficulty seeing them.22 He also described shadows cast by lighting that rendered him unable to see the plaintiff’s face when he first attended to her on her right hand side. In order to provide assistance to her, he was required to move to her opposite side.23 Mr Smith was unable to state if the brass strips were in position on the nosings on 25 December 2004 because he said his attention was focused on the plaintiff and he did not pay attention to the strips.24 Mrs Ryan similarly said that she did not see the metal strips and that in the dim lighting prevailing at the time she thought the strips were made of rubber.25 In relation to crowding, the plaintiff said that as she and her family stood to leave, a number of other patrons also started to move because it was necessary to make way for the second sitting. As a consequence, her view of the steps was obscured by these other patrons. She said she had been looking ahead and down, but nevertheless she walked through a gap in the crowd of patrons thinking that she would step onto carpet. Instead she encountered open air and she fell.26 Mrs Ryan also stated that there were a number of other persons in the area. She said that when she ran to the plaintiff’s assistance after her fall she had to run around them and it was not until she had moved around them that she realised that there were steps present.27 Mr Smith, qualified in first aid, said that he saw the plaintiff fall from his position at a table adjacent to the balustrade. He said he stood from his table and moved to the top of the stairs and jumped to the foot of them. His recollection was that there were not large numbers of persons in the area of the stairs and that he was able to access and jump down them without obstruction.28 Photographs provided in the Dohrmann report showed that the dining room tables in the Jubilee Room in September 2007 were set up in a formation that allowed ten persons to be seated at tables that were placed at right angles to the wall on that side of level two that was furthest from the dance floor. This provided for passageways for persons to walk between the tables and the balustrade that topped the waist high wall separating level two from the dance floor. Persons using this passageway were therefore provided with a view of a distinctly different lower level and of the point at which the balustrade turned at a ninety degree angle and became the banister for the stairs leading to the dance floor.29 This point was described by counsel for the plaintiff as a visual clue to the presence of the stairs and of the need to use those stairs to access the toilets on the far side of the room.30 On 25 December 2004, the tables were arranged so that six persons could be seated at tables that were placed against the wall on that side of level two that was furthest from the dance floor. Tables for two persons were set up against the opposite wall. This provided space for persons to walk between the two rows of tables. 31 The effect of this arrangement was that persons walking between the tables did not have an immediate view of the lower level dance floor which, on that day, was in darkness, or the visual clue to the stairs provided by the ninety degree turn of the railing.32 Photograph 5.8 in the Dohrmann report provided unchallenged evidence of the position of the table closest to the stairs on 25 December 2004.33 Mr Smith said that he was seated at the second table from the staircase against the railing overlooking the dance floor. The defendant relied on his evidence that he was able to see the stairs and able to see the plaintiff at the top of the stairs when she fell.34 This reliance, in my view, overlooked the obvious point that he was seated against the balustrade overlooking the dance floor and that he had a direct view of the short flight of stairs leading to it.35 His evidence was that his view at the start of the plaintiff’s fall was across the shoulder of the person seated at the table closest to the stairs.36 In respect of this material, I make the following findings: 
     
      
      1 I accept that any staircase presents an obvious and inherent risk to a user who does not take care for his or her safety. 
      
     
     
      
      2 I accept the principle of which I was reminded by the defendant, that it was not required by law to take steps to guard against any risk of injury to the plaintiff. 
      
     
     
      
      3 I find that the dimming of the lights in isolation did not generate a requirement that the defendant take any further step to protect the plaintiff from the risk of harm. It was a reasonable step for it to take to create an atmosphere appropriate to the occasion. 
      
     
     
      
      4 There was no evidence that the numbers of patrons in the Jubilee Room at the time of the plaintiff’s fall in isolation generated a requirement that the defendant take any further step to protect the plaintiff from the risk of harm. 
      
     
     
      
      5 I find that the defendant did create a risk that persons such as the plaintiff would not be alerted to the presence of the stairs when it placed tables against the wall and the balustrade adjacent to the dance floor. This step, coupled with the fact that the dance floor was in darkness, reduced the capacity of persons unfamiliar with the premises to appreciate the difference in levels in the two parts of the room. The position of a table at the top of the staircase in particular obscured the view of the staircase and its banister and further reduced the capacity of persons unfamiliar with the premises to sight the presence of the staircase and to appreciate the need to use the staircase when walking towards the toilet. 
      
     
     
      
      6 Notwithstanding Mr Smith’s evidence that the area at the top of the stairs was not particularly crowded, the defendant accepted that it was probable that there were a number of persons in that area and that it was necessary for the plaintiff to step through them. Thus I find that the presence of persons in that area further obstructed the plaintiff’s view of the stairs. 
      
     
     
      
      7 The defendant’s heavy reliance on the plaintiff’s concession that she would have seen the stairs had she been looking, in my view, was misplaced. The plaintiff made this statement in a context where she was shown a photograph of stairs that was contained in the Dohrmann report. This photograph was taken in a fully-lit room without the presence of persons or tables as set up on 25 December 2004. In addition, the plaintiff stated both before and after she made this statement that she did indeed look down but she did not see the stairs because of the presence of persons in that area. I accept that part of her evidence. 
      
     
     
      
      8 Ultimately I have reached the conclusion that, acting reasonably to prevent a foreseeable risk, the defendant ought to have ensured that the open view of the staircase afforded by the manner in which the Jubilee Room was designed remained available to persons in the room. In placing tables against the balustrade at the top of the staircase, the defendant failed to take reasonable precautions against the risk. As already stated, this conduct, coupled with the lighting conditions and the number of persons in the room, combined to create the risk that was the cause of the plaintiff’s fall. 
      
     
     
      
      9 I find the defendant in breach of its duty of care and liable to the plaintiff for the damage that she suffered as a consequence of her fall. 
      
    CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE37 In respect of contributory negligence, having reached the conclusion that the defendant’s negligence put the plaintiff in a position where she was not alerted to the presence of the stairs, I do not consider that she failed to take reasonable care for her own safety in not seeing those stairs. I therefore make no finding of contributory negligence.DAMAGES38 In assessing the plaintiff’s damages, I note that no medical evidence was relied upon by the defendant and the following is a summary of the opinions of the plaintiff’s medical advisers which was unchallenged and is therefore accepted.39 After the fall the plaintiff was taken by ambulance to Echuca Hospital where an X-ray indicated fractures of the greater tuberosity of the right humerus with slight displacement and an undisplaced fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus.40 The plaintiff was admitted, treated and discharged on 28 December 2004.41 Although the fractures healed with time, the plaintiff has continued with severe pain in her right shoulder and arm region with very limited mobility in the shoulder and minimal capacity in the use of the right arm.42 Pain management originally was provided by way of medication and physiotherapy was provided in an attempt to restore some degree of movement to the right shoulder.43 Mr Byrne, orthopaedic specialist, in August 2005 diagnosed adhesive capsulitis resulting from a significant tear in the supraspinatus and retraction of the tendon. He was concerned that the damage might be irreparable. 44 An arthroscopy was undertaken by Mr Byrne in January 2006. He reported that initially the plaintiff’s pain levels were reduced and that with physiotherapy her capacity for movement improved and he expected that there would be further improvement.45 In June 2008, Mr Byrne reported on a deterioration in the plaintiff’s capacity for movement of her arm with continuing significant pain. At this time he diagnosed a vascular necrosis associated with the right humeral head that was the result of the shoulder fractures. He recommended shoulder replacement surgery in order to reduce pain levels while expressing a lack of optimism that improvement in movement would be achieved.46 The plaintiff also consulted Professor Marshall who confirmed that the plaintiff remained with significant restrictions in movement and pain levels, forcing her to rely upon medication for pain relief.47 He confirmed Mr Byrne’s diagnosis and he adopted his recommendation for shoulder replacement surgery.48 The defendant conceded that the plaintiff had suffered a serious injury and accepted the requirement for the shoulder replacement surgery. It contended that the assessment of the plaintiff’s non-economic loss, domestic care needs and medical expenses should take into account the plaintiff’s age and her pre-existing medical condition.49 In this respect, the evidence was that immediately prior to the accident at the age of seventy-six, the plaintiff was fully active and independent. She was maintaining her own home which she shared with her husband. Her activities involved daily gardening, table tennis once a week, and a daily walk with her daughter Karen. The plaintiff maintained her driver’s licence and drove regularly. She attended her local club once a week and danced occasionally.50 The plaintiff stated that her medical conditions at the time were cataracts for which she had been treated and hypertension.51 Her general practitioner at the time, Dr Lok, and the medical notes of his practice, indicate that the plaintiff was also suffering from hypothyroidism and complex partial seizures.52 The plaintiff was medicated in respect of the seizures having sought specialist advice, and the clinical notes indicated that by October 2004, there was some improvement in her condition with this medication.53 The defendant drew my attention to the medical notes indicating that the plaintiff suffered a fall towards the end of November 2004. The plaintiff did not remember this fall, denying that it occurred. I accept from the records that such a fall did occur but in the absence of medical evidence from the defendant to suggest that it was of significance to the assessment of her claim relating to the condition of her right shoulder, I have not taken this material into account.54 I proceed to assess the plaintiff on the basis that at the time of the accident, as might be expected, she suffered from some background age-related health problems but that she remained active and independent.55 The plaintiff is now aged eighty. She complained of significant pain. She held her right arm immobilised at the right side of her body. She stated that she rested her arm at all times on a pillow.56 Her pre-accident activities have all ceased and in 2007 she moved to a house at the rear of Mrs Ryan’s property so that she could be closer to the assistance that Mrs Ryan provides both for her and for Mr McDonald.57 It was apparent that Mr McDonald was also in ill-health suffering from asthma and a back condition. The plaintiff stated that prior to the accident she had cared for him and she now had the capacity to do so only in a very limited way.58 The plaintiff was understandably depressed and unhappy about her situation.59 The defendant reminded me of the principle in Reece v Reece (1994) 19 MVR 103 and suggested that I assess the plaintiff’s non-economic loss at 20 per cent of a most extreme case. 60 I do not consider that this is an appropriate level of assessment having regard to the evidence of considerable disability from which the plaintiff suffers through the virtual loss of use of her right arm and hand and the significant levels of pain from which she continues to suffer.61 I have concluded that an injury and disability of this type in a young and fit person would warrant an assessment of at least 40 per cent. Having regard to the plaintiff’s advanced age, I have assessed her loss at 30 per cent of a most extreme case and I award her $101,500 for her non-economic loss.62 In dealing with domestic and personal care, I note that it is agreed between the parties that the allowance for past care should be assessed at 15 hours a week. This amount has been claimed and is allowed in the sum of $63,991.63 The plaintiff claimed 10 hours a week for the future at a commercial rate of $35 per hour for her life expectancy period of 11 years. I accept the defendant’s contention that there was no evidence that the plaintiff would obtain assistance on a commercial basis in the future and I have therefore assessed this part of the plaintiff’s claim at the current rate for gratuitous assistance of $22.64 per hour.64 As to the level of care, the plaintiff’s evidence was that the care was provided by her husband and Mrs Ryan. Since Mr McDonald is in poor health, it is likely that most of the burden falls upon Mrs Ryan and that it is considerable.65 The plaintiff contended that the true requirement for substantially all of her needs for washing, ironing, housecleaning, cooking and shopping was sixteen and a half hours per week but that this figure had been reduced to 10 hours to take account of the need generated in any event by her advancing age and the prospect of some improvement in her shoulder after surgery.66 I do not accept the figure of 16-1/2 hours as the need generated by this incident. I accept, however, that she needs more substantial assistance than would be provided by the modest cushion suggested by the defendant.67 Taking account of the plaintiff’s age and limited prospects for improvement in movement after surgery, I have assessed her needs at 8 hours per week. I have allowed therefore the future eight hours at $22.64 per hour, resulting in a figure of $80,435.68 Past medical expenses have been claimed in the sum of $13,468.14. This includes claims for damages for travel and accommodation expenses associated with visits to specialist medical advisers.69 The defendant objected to these claims on the basis that they also covered expenses incurred by Mr McDonald when he accompanied the plaintiff to her medical appointments.70 I have noted, however, that the claims were for mileage that would have been travelled by the plaintiff whether alone or accompanied, and that the claims for accommodation appeared to be modest and basically covering room costs only.71 I have therefore allowed past out of pocket expenses as claimed in the sum of $13,468.14.72 In respect of future medical expenses, there is no issue concerning the need for surgery and an allowance is made for the quoted cost of $25,000.73 I accept the defendant’s argument that the plaintiff consulted her general practitioner on a regular basis prior to the accident and was likely to continue to do so.74 I do not accept that the medical records indicated that the plaintiff regularly required painkilling medication such as Panadeine Forte. Only one record in May 2003 indicated a prescription of Panadeine Forte to relieve headaches associated with a viral condition.75 The plaintiff will continue to require medication for which I allow $25.31 per week as claimed. I accept that the plaintiff will incur some additional general practitioner, specialist and travel expenses which are assessed and allowed at the rate of $15 per week.76 I have therefore assessed future expenses to meet these contingencies at $40 per week, resulting in an award of $17,764.77 In summary, the damages awarded to the plaintiff are as follows: 
     
      
      Non-economic loss 
        
       
      at 30 per cent of a most extreme case - $101,500.  
       
      Past care 
       - $63,991.  
       
      Future care 
       - $80,435.  
       
      Past out of pocket expenses 
       - $13,468.14.  
       
      Future out of pocket expenses 
       - $42,764. 
      
    ORDERS 
     
      
      1 Verdict and judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $302,158.14. 
      
     
     
      
      2 The defendant is to pay the plaintiff’s costs on an ordinary basis up to and including 6 August 2008 and on an indemnity basis thereafter. 
      
     
     
      
      3 The exhibits will be retained for twenty-eight days.

   JUDGMENTOverview1 The accused was employed as a bookkeeper by Landilo Staircases Pty Ltd (Landilo), which was owned by her brother, Joe Sukkar. On 29 May 2002, the accused set up a second business account for Landilo (count 1).2 Between May 2002 and May 2003, monies were moved between Landilo's primary business account (Account 1), the second account (Account 2), and personal accounts of the accused and/or her husband, Michael Naime (counts 2 - 20). These related account transfers were effected by cheque deposit and/or telephone transfer. They created a credit balance in Account 1 that was falsely inflated for one working day. The transactions concealed the real position, which was that, on 1 November 2002, Account 1 became overdrawn, and it remained overdrawn until May 2003. The Crown alleged that the accused was a gambler and the cheque/telephone transfers were probably motivated by her gambling.3 The Crown alleged that, on other occasions, the accused used a keycard to withdraw company monies from Account 1 at a St Marys Leagues Club ATM, probably for the purpose of gambling. 4 The accused said that, on the occasions when she did effect cheque/telephone transfers or make ATM withdrawals, she did so at the direction of Mr Sukkar. She did not intend to gain any financial advantage. Insofar as she retained monies, she gained no financial advantage because the monies represented the payment of wages or the repayment of loans which Mr Sukkar or Llandilo owed to her and her husband.The Charges5 On 5 September 2007, the accused elected to be tried by judge alone, and the DPP consented. I was satisfied that, before making the election, the accused had sought and received advice from her barrister, Mr Stanton.6 The accused was charged with one offence against s.178BB (count 1) and 19 offences against section 178BA of the Crimes Act 1900, ie: 
     
      
      (1) 29 May 2002 at Riverstone - make false statement with intent to obtain a financial advantage for herself, ie a sole signatory account in the name of Llandilo (Account 2); 
       
       
      (2) 29 August 2002 at Llandilo - dishonestly obtain for herself a financial advantage, ie credit of $1,500 to her joint account (cheque to Account 6570); 
       
       
      (3) on or about 9 October 2002 at Llandilo -- dishonestly obtain for herself and Michael Naime a financial advantage, ie credit of $7,200 to their joint account (cheque to Account 6570); 
      
     
     
      
      (4) 5 December 2002 at Llandilo - dishonestly obtain for herself and Michael Naime a financial advantage, ie credit of $22,000 to their joint account (telephone transfer); 
       
       
      (5) 12 December 2000 at Llandilo - dishonestly obtain for herself and Michael Name a financial advantage, ie credit of $20,000 to their joint account (telephone transfer); 
       
       
      (6) 5 January 2003 at St Marys - dishonestly obtain for herself $450 (ATM withdrawal); 
       
       
      (7) 30 January 2003 at St Marys - dishonestly obtain for herself $800 (ATM withdrawal); 
       
       
      (8) 11 March 2002 at Llandilo - dishonestly obtain for herself and Michael Naime a financial advantage, ie credit of $19,350 to their joint account (telephone transfer); 
       
       
      (9) 2 April 2003 at St Marys - dishonestly obtain for herself $300 (ATM withdrawal); 
       
       
      (10) 8 April 2003 at St Marys - dishonestly obtain for herself $800 (ATM withdrawal); 
       
       
      (11) 24 April 2003 at Llandilo - dishonestly obtain for herself and Michael Naime a financial advantage, ie credit of $32,250 to their joint account (telephone transfer);  
       
       
      (12) 28 April 2003 at Llandilo - dishonestly obtain for herself and Michael Naime a financial advantage, ie credit of $35,750 to their joint account (telephone transfer); 
       
       
      (13) 1 May 2003 at Llandilo - dishonestly obtain for herself and Michael Naime a financial advantage, ie credit of $36,100 to their joint account (telephone transfer); 
       
       
      (14) 2 May 2003 at Llandilo - dishonestly obtain for herself a financial advantage, ie credit of $2,500 to her account (cheque to Account 7055); 
       
       
      (15) 2 May 2003 at Llandilo - dishonestly obtain for herself and Michael Naime a financial advantage, ie credit of $49,100 to their joint account (telephone transfer); 
       
       
      (16) 5 May 2003 at Llandilo - dishonestly obtain for herself and Michael Naime a financial advantage, ie credit of $46,100 to their joint account (telephone transfer); 
       
       
      (17) 7 May 2003 at Llandilo - dishonestly obtain for herself and Michael Naime a financial advantage, ie credit of $18,200 to their joint account (telephone transfer); 
       
       
      (18) 8 May 2003 at Llandilo - dishonestly obtain for herself a financial advantage, ie credit of $4,500 to her account (cheque to Account 7055);  
       
       
      (19) 12 May 2003 at St Marys - dishonestly obtain for herself $800 (ATM withdrawal); and 
       
       
      (20) 20 May 2003 at Llandilo - dishonestly obtain for herself and Michael Naime a financial advantage, ie credit of $66,150 to their joint account (telephone transfer). 
      
    7. Each of the telephone transfers involved a transfer of money into Account 0354, a cheque account in the joint names of the accused and her husband, using telephone number 47775233 (5233).8. I set out the principles of law which I have applied and the findings of fact which I have made for the purpose of arriving at verdicts.Separate charges9. The twenty charges upon which the accused was tried were heard together as a matter of convenience. I have considered each charge separately and I return a separate verdict on each charge.Onus and Standard of Proof10. The Crown must prove the accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The accused is presumed to be innocent of each charge unless and until the Crown proves her guilty of the charge beyond reasonable doubt. To attain such proof, the Crown must proove each legal element of the relevant offence beyond reasonable doubt.11. If there is a reasonable doubt about the Crown case on any charge, then that doubt must be taken into account when assessing the Crown case on any other charge.Circumstantial evidence12. The Crown case on the counts involving the telephone transfer of funds from Account 1 was circumstantial. There was no direct evidence that the accused effected the particular transfers. Therefore, the Crown’s task was to proove that, based on the established circumstances, the only available rational inference is that the relevant telephone transfer was undertaken by the accused.The Section 178BB Offence13. The elements of the offence against section 178BB of the Crimes Act 1900 (count 1) are that:  
     
      
      (1) the accused made a written statement (in Exhibit F - that she was the sole proprietor of Llandilo); 
       
       
      (2) which she knew to be false in a material particular (she knew that she was not the sole proprietor of Llandilo); 
       
       
      (3) with intent to obtain a financial advantage for herself (a Llandilo account for which she was the sole signatory). 
      
    14. There was no dispute that the accused signed, and therefore ""made"", a written statement that she was the sole proprietor of Llandilo (Exhibit F). Nor was it disputed that, if the accused's purpose was to set up an account which she could use to transfer funds for her financial advantage, then she made the statement with intent to obtain a financial advantage.15. The real issues are whether the accused knew the statement to be false (or may have carelessly signed Exhibit F without reading it) and whether, at that time, she intended to obtain the financial advantage of having a sole signatory Llandilo account which she could use to transfer funds for her financial advantage (or may have set it up on Mr Sukkar's instructions and/or for his purposes).The Section 178BA Offences16. The elements of each offence against section 178BA (counts 2 to 20) are that: 
     
      
      (1) the accused obtained money or a financial advantage (credit) for herself /her husband;  
       
       
      (2) she did so dishonestly; and 
       
       
      (3) she did so by a deception. 
       
       
      ""Deception"" is defined in s178BA to mean: 
       
      ""any deception (whether deliberate or reckless) by words or conduct as to fact or as to law ..."" 
       
      In each case, the Crown relied on a deliberate deception.  
      
    17. Counts 2 and 3 predate 1 November 2002, the date when, but for related account transfers, Account 1 would have become overdrawn (Exhibit V, tab B). In relation to counts 2 and 3, the Crown said that Mr Sukkar/Llandilo were deceived in that the accused used her position to draw company cheques for her own unauthorised purposes. 18. Counts 4 to 20 postdate 1 November 2002. In relation to counts 4 to 20, the Crown said that the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) was deceived because the accused deliberately created related account transfers to give a falsely inflated balance in Account 1 (""kite flying""). Because of the falsely inflated balance, the Bank allowed Account 1 to be debited and the accused to obtain money by ATM withdrawals, and allowed the accused to credit her account by telephone transfer. Whether the accused actually drew against the credit is immaterial. 19. There is no doubt that, if the accused did perpetrate deliberate deceptions in the manner alleged by the Crown, then her conduct was dishonest by the standards of ordinary, reasonable people. Ordinary, reasonable people consider that it is dishonest for an employee to make an unauthorised withdrawal from her employer's account for personal use. They consider that it is dishonest to deliberately move monies between accounts so as to artificially inflate the apparent credit balance in one account, thereby enabling funds to be transferred or credited to other accounts, particularly if the scheme causes the first account to become increasingly overdrawn in real terms.20. In relation to counts 2 and 3, the critical issue is whether the monies may have been paid with Mr Sukkar's express or implied authority as they were wages to which the accused or her husband was entitled. If the monies were paid with Mr Sukkar's authority, then he was not deceived.21. As to counts 4 to 20, the accused said that transactions of that type were done on Mr Sukkar's instructions and for his purposes (rather than her own), and she merely acted on his instructions. If so, the accused did not deliberately deceive the CBA. There is a dispute as to whether the accused made any illegitimate financial gain (or whether monies may have been given to Mr Sukkar as cash, or received by the accused as the payment of wages or the repayment of loans). This matter is critical to element 1, the receipt of financial advantage. The question of whether the accused may have been entitled to the monies which she received is also relevant to the issues of dishonesty and whether the accused deliberately deceived the CBA because, if the accused was entitled to the monies, it is more likely that Mr Sukkar instructed her to act as she did.22. In relation to the counts involving a telephone transfer (particularly counts 4 and 8), there is an issue as to whether the only available rational inference is that it was the accused who effected the transfers. It is necessary to consider whether Mr Sukkar or someone else other than the accused may have effected the transfers. Accused's Character23. The accused is a person of prior good character. I have taken her good character into account when assessing her credibility as a witness (it may be that a person of prior good character is more likely to be truthful) and on the question of her guilt (it may be that a person of prior good character is less likely to have conducted herself dishonestly).Assessment of the Main Witnesses24. Documents were central to the Crown case.25. Mr Sukkar's evidence was important because he refuted the accused's assertion that he directed or authorised transactions and her evidence about monies which he owed to her.26. Mr Sukkar is a volatile individual who believes that he was greatly wronged. Without properly considering questions, he gave answers that were unresponsive or overstated his position. For example, his statement that he never entered the accused's office defies common sense. His initial evidence that he had received nothing for the sale of his share of the Llandilo property to the accused and her husband was probably incorrect. Similarly, he did not recall obtaining a $30,000 business overdraft, although he recalled that an earlier request for an overdraft was refused. In my view, such statements were not conscious lies. Rather, they were unthinking reflections of Mr Sukkar's strong sense of injustice at the hands of his sister, and/or a subconscious attempt to distance himself from the chaos of the business finances, and/or connected with Mr Sukkar's ""breakdown"" and associated depression, stress and panic attacks. His recollection may have been clouded by those conditions. He was an honest witness, but he was not always reliable. 27. The accused noted that, in 2002, WorkCover sought reimbursement of $118,347 from Llandilo. She suggested that the claim placed Llandilo under enormous financial pressure, and may have motivated Mr Sukkar to undertake the related account transfers the subject of the proceedings. However, Mr Fogarty's evidence showed that, in 2002, Llandilo was busy and had a significant turnover.28. Mr Sukkar is a person of very limited resources, who would have been quite incapable of orchestrating the related account transfers in question. I have no doubt that Mr Sukkar was telling the truth when he said that ""kite flying"" transactions (both cheque and telephone transfers) were undertaken without his knowledge or consent. Witnesses gave evidence of Mr Sukkar's shock at learning of the transactions. Further, Mr Sukkar's credit was supported by his immediate complaint to police.29. Although it contained at least one error (as to the date of a conversation with the accused), Mr Ali's evidence was generally convincing because he was a relatively independant witness whose evidence was based on detailed contemporaneous notes.30. Ms Picco, the lessee of the Llandilo Australia Post Office, where the accused did banking, had a clear and relatively detailed memory of interaction with the accused (see paras 86 – 94 below). Her recall of dates was poor, but Ms Picco had an otherwise excellent recall. She provided details such as the accused's reference to her father's illness, which added credence to her testimony. It was suggested that Ms Picco had a motive to lie, ie to excuse her breaches of Australia Post protocol. Ms Picco convincingly dismissed that suggestion. She was a forthright, honest and reliable witness whose evidence was compelling. It showed the accused to be determined and manipulative. 31. The accused was not obliged to give evidence, but chose to do so. I took into account her prior good character and otherwise assessed her evidence in the same way as I assessed the evidence of the other witnesses. She attempted to portray herself as bound to her brother by strong affection, despite his overbearing manner. She asserted that all significant decisions regarding business administration and finances were made by Mr Sukkar. She said that, although she was the bookkeeper, she took no initiative and merely followed his directions. In my view, important aspects of her evidence must be disbelieved. For example, she denied the incriminating statements and conduct of which Ms Picco gave evidence. Despite the frequency of her attendance at registered clubs and the late hours to which she gambled, she denied any gambling problem or associated financial loss. The accused is both clever and devious.32. The evidence of Mr Naime was unnaturally similar to that of his wife. His confident assertion that he was a successful gambler was not credible. Mr Naime's propensity to gamble, his potential financial advantage from the accused's alleged conduct, and his relationship to the accused were relevant to the assessment of his credibility as a witness. Neither the accused nor Mr Sukkar suggested that Mr Naime possessed the information or documents which would have enabled him to undertake any relevant banking transaction. One cannot say what, if anything, he knew of the accused's activities, but he appeared to be not unintelligent. He was not a reliable witness. 33. Inherently unlikely as her evidence seemed, Ms Rosemarie Naime presented as an honest witness. Her evidence was corroborated by evidence from the supervisor at the restaurant where she worked.Background 34. Mr Sukkar is a carpenter. In 1995, he started his own carpentry and joinery business, manufacturing staircases. He had a rudimentary accounting system.35. In March 1996, the accused, her husband and Mr Sukkar bought a property at 59a Fourth Avenue, Llandilo. The improvements on the property comprised a house at the front of the property, a granny flat and a large shed. The accused and her husband lived in the house on the property. 36. Mr Sukkar converted the shed into a factory/workshop. From late 1996, he operated his business from the factory/workshop. A portable structure was acquired and fitted out as an office. Business records, including cheque books, were kept in the office.37. Mr Sukkar began to employ the accused as a part-time bookkeeper and Michael Naime as a staircase installer.38. On 11 September 1996, the business was incorporated as Llandilo Staircases Pty Ltd (Llandilo). Mr Sukkar was the sole shareholder and director of Llandilo.39. The accused worked from the office. Mr Sukkar had a desk and telephone in the factory area. Despite Mr Sukkar's statement that he never entered the office, he must have done so. It is contrary to common sense that he would never have entered the on site office from which his business affairs were administered. In this regard, his evidence reflected a subconscious attempt to distance himself from Llandilo's financial administration. 40. Llandilo's telephone number 5233 was connected in the office. I accept Mr Sukkar's evidence that, out of business hours, the line was available for use by the accused and her husband. Mr Woods (a former Llandilo employee who was called in the accused's case and who was a careful and apparently reliable witness) confirmed that there was a telephone connexion in a bedroom of the residence. Mr Sukkar produced an account for telephone number 5233, addressed to Mary Naime at 59a Fourth Avenue. Telephone accounts referring to telephone banking on telephone number 5233 would have come to the accused as, up to May 2003, Llandilo mail was delivered to a letterbox near the house at Fourth Avenue, from where it was collected by the accused. 41. On 19 November,1998, Mr Sukkar sold his interest in the Fourth Avenue property to the accused and her husband for $45,000. They were to assume responsibility for the outstanding mortgage over the property. Initially, Mr Sukkar stated that he had received no money. In cross-examination, he conceded that he may have been paid. It is likely that Mr Sukkar was paid for his share of the property. 42. The accused said that, in April 1999, Mr Sukkar was paid $22,000 by way of cash obtained through Mr Naime's brother, John Nehme, from whom she and her husband borrowed a total of $30,000. She said that, on 15 November 2000, Mr Sukkar was paid the outstanding $23,000. John Nehme gave evidence that, in April 1999, he provided $30,000 cash to the accused and her husband and witnessed them hand some of the money to Mr Sukkar. The document tendered through him (Exhibit 22, a statutory declaration dated 22 August 2000) does not support Mr Nehme's oral evidence, in that it says that $30,000 was loaned to Mr Naime in April 1991 (or 1994?). Mr Nehme was an inappropriate, defensive and belligerent witness. I place no credence on his evidence. However, there is some support for accused's assertion that Mr Sukkar was paid an initial installment of $22,000. A statutory declaration dated 18 August 2000, which appears to have been signed by Mr Sukkar, states that the accused and her husband ""still owe me $23,000."" In November 2000 $23,000 was paid to Mr Sukkar (Exhibit 2). Llandilo's Banking43. The accused was responsible for Landilo's banking.44. Initially, the accused drew business cheques and Mr Sukkar signed them.45. On 16 October 1996, Llandilo opened a business account at the CBA, Granville (account number 2174 1008 7652 - Account 1). When the account was opened, Mr Sukkar requested an overdraft facility for business purposes, but his request was declined. Mr Sukkar did not recall attending the Bank to open the account. However, he probably did attend. Mr Sukkar's identification details were provided to the Bank. He signed the account application form, Exhibit C. Both Mr Sukkar and the accused became authorised signatories. The accused said that, at about that time, Mr Sukkar asked her to sign company cheques. 46. Mr Sukkar said that he did not properly read the account application form before he signed it, and did not realise that he had authorised the accused to sign cheques. Acording to Mr Sukkar, in early 1998, the accused informed him that he no longer needed to sign company cheques to pay suppliers because a CBA officer had said that she could sign the supplier cheques. As he was often on the road, this arrangement suited Mr Sukkar and he agreed to it. 47. It is not necessary to determine the factual dispute between Mr Sukkar and the accused. Both accounts may be substantially correct. On each account, at all relevant times the accused was authorised to sign Landilo cheques drawn on Account 1 for business purposes . 48. On Mr Sukkar's evidence, the accused had free rein with Llandilo's finances. He kept a diary in which he noted the cheques which he believed had been received by Llandilo and those which he believed had been drawn on the business account. The diary recorded what Mr Sukkar believed to be the approximate running balance from time to time. The accused would show him handwritten statements of monies banked to Account 1 and cheques paid from that account (similar to Exhibit D). He had not seen the original diaries since May 2003, but Exhibits 7 and 8 (produced by Landilo's liquidator from documents located at the Fourth Avenue premises) were part of his 2003 diary. I accept Mr Sukkar’s evidence in this regard, particularly as it is partly supported by documentary evidence.49. Mr Sukkar gave evidence of his understanding that, on Fridays, the accused attended the Penrith CBA to bank cheques received in the preceding week and to withdraw cash for wages. He believed that he received his wages of $387 by direct bank transfer into his passbook Account 7000. The reconstruction of his account (Exhibit X) does show payments of $387 in 2001-2002. He said that the accused and her husband were each paid $387pw. Sometimes, they received additional cash payments. Other employees confirmed that, generally speaking, wages were paid on a Friday. I accept Mr Sukkar’s evidence of his understanding regarding the payment of wages.50. The accused said that she only wrote cheques when instructed to do so by Mr Sukkar. According to the accused and her husband, Mr Sukkar closely supervised the writing of cheques. Mr Sukkar would ""stand over"" the accused, dictating the payee and the relevant amount from notes in his diary. The accused's husband said that, at times, Mr Sukkar raised his voice and created ""bad vibes"". 51. Mr Rea, a former employee of Llandilo, said that he had ""probably"" seen Mr Sukkar with the accused when she wrote out cheques. Mr Rea's evidence is suspect, as he was a nervous witness who purported to recall some matters of detail, but had little idea of the year in which he worked for Llandilo. The accused and her husband provided him with free accommodation for six months from 29 May 2003. In any event, Mr Rea's evidence in this regard does not provide significant support for the accused's version of events.52. In relation to wages, the accused said that Mr Sukkar would instruct her to write a cash cheque and she would do so. She would sign the cheque, cash it, and hand the cash to Mr Sukkar, who would then pay cash to his employees. From about 2000, she kept a wages book. Prior to 2000, the wages book was kept by Mr Sukkar's accountant. In the period mid 2002 to May 2003, her wages were $450 pw, and her husband was paid $1200 -1500 pw, depending on the work which he had undertaken. She said that she and her husband were treated differently from other employees. They were not always paid on a Friday. Mr Sukkar would pay them varying amounts whenever it suited him. 53. On 2 August 2000, the accused opened a CBA account at the Penrith Branch in the name of Llandilo (Account 5278). She said that the account was opened at Mr Sukkar's request for GST purposes. The accused was the signatory to the account. Mr Sukkar denied that he knew of the account prior to May 2003. This account received little use. It is possible that Mr Sukkar knew but forgot about it.54. In relation to telephone banking on a business account, a password may be obtained by an authorised signatory who holds a keycard linked to the business account, and may then be utilised for telephone banking.55. On 23 February 2001, a CBA keycard attached to Account 1 was issued in the accused's name (keycard 4376). The keycard remained current until after May 2003. The accused said that, in early 2001, Mr Sukkar told her to obtain a keycard and showed her how to do telephone banking, for the purpose of enabling her to repay money which the business owed her into her personal account 5116, and to enable the payment of wages. Mr Sukkar denied knowledge or use of the keycard.56. I accept Mr Sukkar's evidence that he did not know of the existence of the keycard, or it's use for telephone banking. His knowledge of modern banking practice was rudimentary and largely confined to the use of cheques. The keycard for Account 1 (and for Account 2) was issued in the accused's name. Although the accused maintained that keycards were kept in the office and were ""available"" for use by Mr Sukkar, no keycard transactions were identified as having been performed by Mr Sukkar.57. Mr Sukkar said that, on several occasions, the accused told him that the business account needed funds. On 11 December 2001, 13 February 2002 and 9 April 2002, he withdrew from his son Mario's bank account a total of $35,000 by way of three bank cheques. The bank statements show that these amounts were deposited into Account 1 and recorded as ""directors loans"". Compared to the later related account transfers, these deposits were a very different way of fortifying Account 1. Mr Sukkar's Alleged Indebtedness To The Accused58. The accused said that, in October 1999, Llandilo obtained an overdraft of $20,000. By that time, the Fourth Avenue property was free of a mortgage, and she and her husband agreed that it could be used as security for the overdraft. Exhibit 3 is the relevant mortgage. Exhibit 11 refers to a guarantee provided by Mr Sukkar for a Llandilo debt of $20,000. In May 2000, the overdraft secured by the mortgage was increased to $30,000.59. According to the accused, in November 2000, the overdraft secured by the mortgage was discharged using part of a loan of $180,000 obtained by the accused and her husband. Mr Sukkar/Llandilo thereby became indebted to the accused and her husband in the sum of $30,000. The accused's evidence is supported by bank statements which show that, on 15 November 2000, $30,000 was injected into Account 1, creating a credit balance (Exhibit 4) . 60. The accused said that, as at November 2000, Mr Sukkar owed her and her husband $54,000, ie:(1) $30,000 loaned on 15 November 2000, originally the subject of an overdraft (see Exhibit 4);(2) $17,000 loaned on 17 November 2000 after a company cheque bounced (see Exhibits 5 and 12);(3) $2,000 loaned on 22 November 2000; and(4) $5,000 loaned on 14 May 1999 (see Exhibit 15).61. There is no documentary support for the proposition that the sums of $2,000 and $5,000 emanated from the accused. Indeed, in Exhibit 5, the accused noted the sum of $2,000 as being ""directors monies"". However, because there is some documentary evidence to support some of the assertions of the accused and her husband, I am prepared to assume (without deciding) that, in late 2000, Mr Sukkar did owe them at least $47,000 and possibly as much as $54,000.62. The accused said that, in addition to the sum of $54,000, in the period mid 2002 to mid 2003, she and her husband loaned other monies to Mr Sukkar. They were regular poker machine gamblers at the St Mary's Leagues Club. She was also a member of the Penrith Rugby League Club (Panthers). They attended a club a few times a week for dinner and in order to enjoy themselves. Occasionally, they remained at a club until 3 am. They were successful gamblers. According to the accused's husband, overall, they won more money than they lost.63. When a St Mary's Leagues Club gambler wins more than $1,000 in a sittings, the amount under $1,000 may be paid in cash, but the amount over $1,000 is paid by cheque. 64. Between June 2002 and May 2003, the accused did deposit cheques (totalling approximately $15,700) from gambling winnings into Account 1. The accused and her husband said that, when the accused told Mr Sukkar of her winnings, he often asked her to deposit the money into the company account. She kept no record of those ""loans"" to Mr Sukkar, trusting him to keep an accurate record of the ""loans"" in his diary. 65. I consider that the accused and her husband lied about this matter. It was not put to Mr Sukkar that he asked the accused to deposit her gambling winnings into Account 1. The deposit of gambling winnings may well have been an attempt by the accused to repay monies which she had withdrawn illegitimately. 66. The accused said that the various loans were repaid by Mr Sukkar in an ad hoc fashion. She would make telephone transfers into her account, as and when Mr Sukkar instructed her to do so. He would ring her and tell her to effect a telephone transfer, or would write out amounts which were to be transferred and place the note in front of her. He would stand next to her while she complied with his written directions. Sometimes, Mr Sukkar himself made telephone transfers to her Account 6570 (although no particular transfers were identified). At times, Mr Sukkar himself effected telephone transfers to her Visa account 7115 (although no particular transfers were identified). After making a transfer, he would advise her that he had done so. 67. The accused's account of the ad hoc loan of gambling winnings and the ad hoc repayment of substantial loans of indeterminate amount was a blatant lie. The accused and her husband kept a record neither of the monies loaned nor of the monies repaid, allegedly relying upon the honesty of Mr Sukkar. Nor did the accused check her bank records to ascertain what monies had been received. It was not put to Mr Sukkar that he kept a record of loans and loan repayments in his diary. Exhibits 7 and 8 (parts of the 2003 diary) contain no such record. The spreadsheets compiled by Mr Fogarty show that monies paid from Account 1 to the accused's Account 5116 were immediately withdrawn at a club (probably for gambling - see Exhibit V, tab E). The spreadsheets show that monies paid from Account 1 to the accused's Account 0354 were closely associated with monies paid from Account 0354 to Account 1, ie the monies were not paid into the accused's account by way of loan repayment but by way of ""kite flying"" (Exhibit V, tab D) . Count 168. In unascertainable circumstances, a ""Y"" indicator was attached to Account 1, so cheques drawn on Account 1 were cleared and credited immediately, and could be drawn upon immediately. As the cheques were not debited from Account 1 until the next working day, by means of ""related account transfers"", ""available"" funds could be artificially inflated for one working day. 69. The Crown submitted that, having become aware that Account 1 cheques were cleared immediately, in about May 2002 the accused opened an account for the purpose of ""kite flying"".70. On 29 May 2002, the accused opened CBA account number 2596 1014 6448 (Account 2) at the Riverstone Branch. The accused signed an authority for firm accounts in relation to Llandilo, which stated that she was the sole proprietor of Llandilo and the sole signatory for Accounts 1 and 2 (Exhibit F). 71. The accused said that she opened Account 2 at the request of Mr Sukkar. She said that she told Mr Scully, the Bank officer, that she was a signatory on Account 1, but was not a director of Llandilo. The latter proposition was not put to Mr Scully in cross-examination. The accused denied telling the Bank that she was the sole proprietor of Llandilo. She said that she showed the Bank the cheque book for Account 1, and then signed the document where she was told to sign. 72. Mr Scully said that he would have accessed details regarding Landilo's accounts on the computer. He failed to follow usual procedure and ""verify the company director where the original account was opened"", i.e. failed to contact the Granville Branch to obtain a copy company search identifying the Llandilo directors.73. Generally, Mr Sukkar has consistently denied knowledge of Account 2. The accused relied on Mr Ali's note that, on 29 May 2003, Mr Sukkar said that ""he was aware of (a second account)"". However, that note is qualified by Mr Ali’s statement ""he thought that all these accounts were the one account"" (consistent with a statement made earlier that day to Mr Matta), Mr Sukkar's statement to Mr Ali on 30 May (per Mr Bougoine) and Mr Sukkar's shock and anger when he learned about the three accounts, the telephone banking and the ""kite flying"". If Mr Sukkar used the words attributed to him, he did not mean that he was aware that Account 2 had been opened and used over the preceding twelve months.74. On 29 May 2002, a keycard for Account 2 was issued in the accused's name. The accused said that she gave the keycard to Mr Sukkar, who placed it in the office with the cheque books. She agreed that she did use the keycard, but said that it was also available to Mr Sukkar. Mr Sukkar denied knowledge or use of the card. Another keycard for Account 2 was issued on 16 October 2002 (keycard 4328 17).75. The accused's personal Account 5116 was operated until 21 October 2002. In the period June to October 2002, there were many occasions when, but for the telephone transfer of substantial sums from Account 1 or Account 2 to Account 5116, Account 5116 would have become overdrawn. The monies transferred from Account 1 or Account 2 were usually withdrawn from Account 5116 on the same day, utilising ATM machines at the St Marys Leagues Club or the Panthers Club (tab E, Exhibit V). But for related account transfers, Account 5116 would have been overdrawn by $11,042 as at 21 October 2002.76. I find that the accused lied about the circumstances in which she came to sign Exhibit F. Rather, the accused intentionally signed the statement in Exhibit F. She opened Account 2 so that she could engage in ""kite flying"" for her own financial advantage. The main reasons for these findings are as follows.(1) The spreadsheets compiled by Mr Fogarty show that almost no legitimate transactions were processed through Account 2 and that the account was used for ""kite flying"". (2) The accused's personal accounts benefitted from the ""kite flying"", and the benefit began soon after Account 2 was opened.(3) The accused was a gambler. Gamblers may seek short term access to funds in the unrealistic expectation that a winning will materialise and the money can be repaid. There were occasions when the accused did pay her winnings into Account 1.(4) Had the accused made the alleged a contrary statement, it is inherently unlikely that Mr Scully would have thought that the accused was the sole proprietor of Llandilo. The proposition was not put to him. The Exhibit F statement that the accused was the sole proprietor of Llandilo must have emanated from the accused herself. (5) It is inherently unlikely that the accused, a bookkeeper, would have failed to read a critical part of a short Bank document and identify an important error. (6) Mr Sukkar was an honest, albeit somewhat unreliable witness. I accept that Account 2 was not opened at his direction and that it was not until May 2003 that he knew about Account 2 or the associated keycard and telephone banking. I have referred the evidence of Mr Ali and others regarding Mr Sukkar's shock and disbelief when he learned of Account 2 and it's use for ""kite flying"". Even Mr Naime said that, on 28 May 2003, Mr Sukkar was furious and alleged that he had been ""robbed"". On learning of the transactions, Mr Sukkar made an immediate complaint to police.Financial Transactions From October 200277. On 16 October 2002 (the same day that a new keycard was issued in the accused's name on Account 2), Account 0354 was opened in the joint names of the accused and her husband. It was operated between November 2002 and 6 June 2003. The accused and her husband said that the account was opened because they needed a cheque account in order to make repayments on a new vehicle. The accused said that she provided Mr Sukkar with the account details. At Mr Sukkar's direction, she drew cheques on the account. 78. On 16 October 2002, the accused also opened passbook account 7055 (tab H in Exhibit V, Exhibit 17). She said that it was intended to be an investment account. Her wages and those of her husband were paid into the account. She said that Mr Sukkar knew the account details. 79. The accused said that Mr Sukkar specifically told her to make ATM withdrawals from Account 1 at clubs. Sometimes, he told her to travel to the St Marys Leagues Club for the specific purpose of withdrawing cash from an ATM. On other occasions, knowing that she was at the Club with her husband, he telephoned her and directed her to withddraw money from the ATM at the Club. In the course of an evening, he might make two or three such telephone calls. The cash which she withdrew was not used for gambling purposes. She gave it to Mr Sukkar herself, or gave it to her husband to pass on to Mr Sukkar. The accused's husband corroborated the accused's evidence.80. As one example of the improbability of the accused's account of ATM withdrawals at clubs, the Crown referred to the ATM withdrawals made from Accounts 1 and 2 at the St Marys Leagues Club between approximately 10:30 pm on 3 December and 12:25 am on 4 December 2002. There were 7 withdrawals, for amounts ranging from $80 to $200 (total $880), and one account inquiry. It is hardly likely that Mr Sukkar would have made many late night calls to the accused, instructing her to withdraw small amounts of money. It is very likely that the accused was gambling and, because she was losing money, she continued to make withdrawals.81. There is no obvious rational explanation for Mr Sukkar asking the accused to travel some distance from her home/workplace to make ATM withdrawals at a specific club ATM, particularly if (as the accused alleged) he knew that she (and he) could access telephone banking. 82. The accused referred to a telephone call to the CBA telephone transfer number at 12:13 pm on 9 August 2002. She said that she could not have made the call. The accused and her husband said that, on Friday, 9 August, 2002, they left Sydney in the early morning and travelled to Melbourne by car to see a wrestling match. They returned late on the night of Sunday, 11 August 2002. Although the accused did produce a ticket to a Melbourne wrestling match on the night of Saturday, 10 August, there is no corroboration of the evidence of the accused and her husband as to the time of their departure from Sydney and both witnesses were unreliable. 83. I have found (at para 26 and elsewhere) that Mr Sukkar was an honest witness. I accept that he knew nothing about Account 2, the keycards attached to Accounts 1 and 2, or the associated ATM withdrawals, telephone banking or ""kite flying"". Ms Picco's Evidence84. Cheques presented at an Australia Post Office CBA agency are credited immediately. Debits are processed at the CBA Operations Centre on the next working day.85. In about October 2002, the accused began to use the CBA agency facility at the Llandilo Post Office. She dealt with the licensee, Mary Picco. 86. Ms Picco said that, when banking at the Post Office, the accused used a keycard which was in her name. The keycard also contained a business reference. 87. Ms Picco remembered the accused stating that she and her brother owned Llandilo. A couple of months after she began to bank at the Post Office, the accused told Ms Picco that she and her husband, Michael, had purchased Llandilo. The accused denied the conversation.88. Ms Picco said that the accused came to the Post Office almost every day to deposit cheques for substantial amounts (from about $7,000 to about $16,000) into a Llandilo account. The accused told Ms Picco that her brother banked business cheques at Auburn. She said that there were two Llandilo accounts, and that she was transferring money between the accounts so that withdrawals would be debited in the evening ""because the payments had to come out that night"". The accused denied the conversation. 89. Ms Picco said that she asked the accused to stop ""business banking"" at the Post Office, ie to stop transferring monies from one business account to another. Subsequently, Ms Picco refused to accept banking which she classed as ""business banking"". After the ""business banking"" conversation, the accused deposited cheques for lesser amounts -- usually about $2,000 -- made out to "" pay Mary Naime"" or ""pay cash"". Because Ms Picco knew that the accused had a passbook account in her own name and understood that the cheques were being deposited into that private account, she accepted the deposits. Ms Picco did not appreciate that, although the cheques were made out to the accused and the accused was nominated on the deposit slip as the account holder, in fact the cheques were drawn on Account 1 and paid into Account 1 or Account 2.90. The accused denied the conversation concerning ""business banking"". She asserted that Ms Picco told her to make cheques out in her own name, and she obtained Mr Sukkar's agreement before instituting the practice.91. It was Ms Picco's evidence that the accused asked her to bank cheques as ""cash"" and offered to pay her for that service, but she declined the offer. On one occasion, Ms Picco did agree to deposit as ""cash"" a cheque for $17,600. About a week later, Ms Picco showed the accused a letter from Australia Post informing Ms Picco that she must not accept such ""cash"" deposits. 92. Ms Picco said that, in about February 2003, the accused sought to deposit six Llandilo cheques, ranging from $7,000 to $17,000, as ""cash"". Initially, Ms Picco declined the request. The accused began to cry and told Ms Picco that she was experiencing difficulties with her sister-in-law concerning the sale of Llandilo. The accused showed Ms Picco a letter which appeared to be on CBA Penrith Branch letterhead, and which purported to authorise the Post Office to clear cheques for the accused. She told Ms Picco that her father was ill and she needed to visit him. Ms Picco then cleared one cheque. The cheque was dishonoured.93. The accused denied that she possessed a letter from the CBA or showed any such document to Ms Picco. 94. Except as to dates, I accept Ms Picco's evidence, including her evidence that the accused lied about ownership of Llandilo, attempted to deceive Ms Picco by drawing cheques to herself or ""cash"" but continuing to do ""business banking"" after being told that it was unacceptable, and produced a bogus CBA document in an attempt to persuade Ms Picco to accept ""cash"" cheques.May 2003 95. On 13 May 2003, Account 1 went into debit (Exhibit S). But for related account transfers, Account 1 would have become overdrawn in November 2002 and the overdraft would have increased in the period up to May 2003.96. According to a diary note which he made on 25 June 2003, on 14 May, Mr Ali of the CBA rang the accused (the nominated point of contact for Llandilo). He asked her why cheques were being deposited at the Llandilo Post Office instead of the local CBA branch. The accused stated that it was a matter of convenience. He asked why Account 1 was overdrawn. She stated that she had been unable to transfer money as her father was seriously ill in Westmead Hospital. 97. The accused said that was not until 19 May that she spoke to Mr Ali. On 16 May, her father was admitted to Westmead Hospital suffering from a serious illness. He was discharged on 6 June. The accused said that, on 19 May, she did tell Mr Ali that her father was in hospital, but she did not say that she had been ""unable to transfer money"" for that reason.98. As Mr Sukkar Snr was not admitted until 19 May, Mr Ali must be wrong about the date of the conversation. However, he is a relatively independent witness who made a reasonably contemporaneous note of the conversation. I accept his evidence about it's contents.99. Mr Ali said that, on 23 May 2003, he telephoned the accused. He told her that the company account would become overdrawn as a result of cheques being dishonoured. She said that she did not understand, but would ensure that account was brought back to order.100. The accused agreed that she spoke to Mr Ali on 23 May, but said that there was no mention of cheques being dishonoured. It was not until after 29 May that she learned that cheques had been dishonoured. In the conversation of 23 May, she merely provided Mr Sukkar's mobile telephone number, to enable Mr Ali to contact Mr Sukkar.101. I accept Mr Ali's version of the conversation.102. On 23 May 2003, the CBA removed the ""Y"" indicator and put a ""stop"" on Account 1.103. Ms Picco said that the accused told Ms Picco that her personal accounts and the Llandilo accounts had been frozen ""because her brother had stolen all the business cheques"". The accused said that ""there was no money left in the business"". The accused denied the conversation, but I accept Ms Picco's evidence.104. According to Mr Sukkar, on 28 May 2003, Mr Ali telephoned Mr Sukkar. Mr Ali said that he had left messages with the accused asking that Mr Sukkar contact him. Inter alia, Mr Ali told him that Account 1 was overdrawn by $255,860. 105. Mr Ali could not recall whether he spoke to Mr Sukkar on 28 May.106. Mr Sukkar said that, after receiving Mr Ali's telephone call, on 28 May he telephoned the accused and asked why she had failed to pass on a message to call Mr Ali. She stated that she had forgotten. In relation to the overdrawing, she told him:""don't worry, there is nothing wrong with the accounts""and ended the call. Later, she telephoned Mr Sukkar and said:""someone is playing a joke on you and if anybody rings you from the Commonwealth Bank do not answer your home phone or your mobile"".107. The accused denied the conversation. She said that the Bank did telephone and ask to speak to Mr Sukkar. She told Mr Sukkar that he should call the Bank.108. Mr Sukkar said that, later on 28 May, Mr Ali telephoned him and said that the accused had been transferring money from a business account to an account held by herself and her husband. An arrangement was made for Mr Sukkar to attend the Bank on the following day. Mr Sukkar said that, at about 4.30 pm, he telephoned the accused and told her that the Bank wished to discuss the accounts and was coming to the business premises to see the paperwork. 109. The accused said that she did not speak to Mr Sukkar on that day. From Sunday, 25 May, she was unwell and bedridden. 110. The accused's husband said that, at about 8:30 pm on 28 May, he received a telephone call from Mr Sukkar, who was yelling and swearing. Mr Sukkar accused Mr Naime of ""robbery"" and stated that he was in contact with the ""Fraud Department"".111. If one accepts Mr Naime's evidence about this conversation, then Mr Sukkar must have had an earlier conversation with Mr Ali in which he was given some information about the Naimes using company funds in an unauthorised manner.112. Generally, I accept Mr Sukkar's account of conversations with the accused and Mr Ali on 28 May. However, given Mr Ali's account of what transpired on 29 May, it may be that the amount of the overdrawing - $255,860 - was not mentioned until 29 May.113. On 29 May 2003 at about 3 am, the accused was taken by ambulance to the Nepean Hospital complaining of nausea and suffering from hyperventilation. She was released mid morning and collected by her husband (Exhibit 13). The accused said that she had been sick since at least 23 May 2003. The Crown submitted that the accused was feigning illness. It is neither possible nor necessary to make a finding in this regard.114. On the morning of 29 May, Mr Sukkar, Mathew Matta (Mr Sukkar's brother-in-law, a Llandilo employee) and other employees arrived at the Fourth Avenue property to commence work. They were unable to gain entry as the accused's vehicle had been reversed up to the gate. After an unproductive conversation with the accused's husband, they returned to Mr Sukkar's home. Mr Matta said that, en route, Mr Sukkar told him that the Bank had telephoned about ""overdue accounts"" but ""he couldn't understand what was going on with the accounts because he only had one account"". I accept Mr Matta’s evidence.115. Later that morning, Mr Sukkar, his wife and Mr Matta met Mr Ali and another CBA officer at the CBA. On 30 May, Mr Ali made a detailed diary note of the meeting.The diary note states that, when Mr Sukkar was told that Account 1 was overdrawn by $255,861, Mr Sukkar ""did not seem to comprehend and was in complete denial"". When told of the existence of Account 2 and the fact that the accused was the signatory on that account :""Mr Sukkar advised that whilst his signature is not on the Authority he was aware of (a second account) but commented that he thought that all these accounts were the one account.""116. Mr Ali's diary note records that, when Mr Sukkar learned that there were three accounts and that ""kite flying"" had occurred using telephone banking, he became ""very upset"" and ""continued to be in denial"". Mr Sukkar expressed the ""firm belief"" that it could be a Bank error, but, after further explanation, he appeared to accept the situation. 117. Mr Matta had a similar recollection of the meeting, except that he recalled Mr Sukkar saying:""I only have one account that I know of and I don't know anything about an overdraft.""118. Mr Ali denied Mr Sukkar's evidence that, in the course of the meeting, he (Mr Ali) said:""We don't want the Fraud Squad to be involved. We want your sister to come and sort it out.""119. Mr Matta confirmed Mr Sukkar's evidence that, while Mr Sukkar was at the Bank, he attempted to contact the accused. Mr Matta recalled that the attempt was unsuccessful, whereas Mr Sukkar said that he spoke to the accused, who told him never to contact her again. It does not matter which account is correct. At the time, both witnesses would have been very upset, and that may have affected their recall. 120. On 29 May, the accused and her husband spoke to a solicitor regarding Mr Sukkar's allegations.121. On 30 May, Mr Bougoide, a financial accountant and family friend of Mr Sukkar, accompanied Mr Sukkar to a meeting with Mr Ali at the Bank. Mr Bougoine said that, in the course of the meeting, Mr Sukkar informed Mr Ali that the accused's authority was limited to making supplier payments and paying wages, and that she had no authority to open or close accounts or make other payments. Mr Bougoide was ""positive"" that Mr Sukkar denied all knowledge of Account 2. According to Mr Bougoide, Mr Ali said:""We are willing to resolve this matter internally if your sister will come in and cooperate.""122. This recollection is similar to Mr Sukkar's memory of a statement made by Mr Ali on the previous day.123. After the meeting, Mr Sukkar and Mr Bougoide proceeded to the Granville Police Station, where Mr Sukkar made a ""walk in"" report.124. Account 1 was frozen with a debit balance of $255,860. The accused's Account 0354 was frozen with a credit balance of $111,542.125. Llandilo received an account for unpaid taxation. At the instigation of the Australian Taxation Office, on 3 October 2003, a liquidator was appointed. Subsequently, the company was wound up.Mr Fogarty's Evidence126. Mr Fogarty, a forensic accountant, gave evidence about many substantial transfers of funds between Account 1, Account 2, Account 5116, Account 7055 and Account 0354. In the period 30 May 2002 to 6 June 2003, a total of $17,286,904 flowed between those accounts by way of related account transfers (Exhibit V, summary spreadsheet document attached to Mr Fogarty's statement of 17 September 2007).127. From about October 2002, there were almost daily related account transfers involving Accounts 1 and 2. The nature of the transactions is illustrated in Exhibit EE. A number of substantial cheques, totalling, say, $68,000, would be drawn on Account 2 and deposited to Account 1. The funds would be credited to Account 1 immediately. There would be a telephone transfer of about $68,000 from Account 1 to Account 2. On the following day, the cheques would be debited to Account 2. The effect of the dealings was to temporarily inflate the apparent credit balance in Account 1. 128. In some instances (including counts 4,5,8,11,12,13,15,16,17 and 20) there were telephone transfers from Account 1 to one of the accused's accounts (for example, for count 4, the total sum was $45,900). On the same day, cheques totalling a slightly lesser sum were drawn on the accused's account and paid to Account 1 (for example, for count 4, the slightly lesser sum was $45,400).129. On other occasions, a cheque was drawn on Account 1 and deposited to the accused's Account 6570 (counts 2 and 3) or 7055 (counts 14 and 18), where it was immediately credited, although it was not debited to Account 1 until the next working day.130. Between 3 December 2002 and 23 May 2003, significant withdrawals from Accounts 1 and 2 were made from ATMs at the St Marys Leagues Club and the Panthers Club (Exhibits Z and AA). For example, between 10:30 pm on 3 December and 12:25 am on 4 December 2002, a total of $880 was withdrawn from the accounts. ATM withdrawals are the subject of counts 6, 7, 9, 10 and 19.131. In the period 30 May 2002 to 6 June 2003, there was a net deficit to Account 1 of $254,195, compromising: net gain to the accused's accounts $187,090 ATM withdrawals $ 45,490 net gain to Account 2 $ 21,165 $254,195132. In the same period, there was a net gain to the accused's accounts of $203,310 from Accounts 1 and 2, comprising: Account 0354 $118,495 Account 5116 $ 11,045 Account 6570 $ 57,670 Account 7055 $ 16,100 $203,310133. In addition, between June 2002 and May 2003, twenty transfers, totalling $15,630, were made from Account 1 or 2 to the accused's Visa Account 7115.134. In May 2003, when the accounts were frozen, Account 1 was overdrawn by about $256,558, there was $111,543 credit in Account 0354, and there was no significant balance in any other account. Count 2135. On 29 August 2002, the accused drew cheque 1778 for $1500 on Account 1, made payable to herself and her husband. She deposited it to Account 6570. On the relevant cheque butt, she wrote ""woodturner"". Prior to this deposit, the balance in Account 6570 was $10.53. On 29 August 2002, the accused was at the St Marys Leagues Club. On that day, $400 was transferred by telephone from Account 1 to Account 5116 and withdrawn at a St Mary's Leagues Club ATM (tab E, Exhibit V). .136. The accused said that cheque 1778 was for wages payable to herself and her husband.137. The incorrect notation on cheque butt 1778 was not an isolated occurrence. A number of Account 1 cheque butts refer to supplier payees, but the payee on the relevant cheque is the accused and her husband, and the cheque was deposited to their account. For example, between 10 and 17 September 2002, Account 1 cheques 1787 to 1792 for the total amount of $8,300 were made out to the accused and her husband and deposited to account 6570, although the relevant cheque butts refer to business purposes. There are many cheque butts that are blank or contain information that is contrary to the information on the related cheque. The accused's handwritten ledger (Exhibit D) also contains falsely recorded items.138. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the sum of $1,500 was not wages. The sum in question corresponds neither to Mr Sukkar's evidence nor to the accused's evidence about the amount which was paid by way of wages. Had it been ""wages"", the accused would not have concealed the transaction by writing ""woodturner"" on the butt. Prior to the deposit, the accused's account contained almost no money. As the accused was at a club on that day, the likely motive was to obtain money for gambling, or to recover money lost through gambling.Count 3139. On Wednesday, 9 October 2002, cheque 1810 for $7,200 was drawn on Account 1, made payable to M and M Naime, and deposited into Account 6570. The cheque butt is blank. Via seven withdrawals, $7,200 was withdrawn from Account 6570. Prior to the deposit and following the withdrawals, the account balance was $559.10.140. On the same day, $5,200 cash was deposited into Account 2 at the Llandilo Post Office. On 8 October, $2,000 cash had been deposited into Account 2. On 9 October, $7,200 was paid from Account 2 to Account 1 by two telephone transfers, $5,200 (at 10.45am) and $2,000 (at 11.58pm).141. The accused said that Mr Sukkar directed her to write cheque 1810 for $7,200. Later in the day, when she was doing the banking at the Llandilo Post Office, Mr Sukkar telephoned her and directed her to put $5,200 into Account 2. The accused said that $2,000 was owed to her and her husband for wages and was retained in Account 6570.142. I have found that Mr Sukkar did not know about Account 2. The sum of $2,000 does not correspond to any wages amount referred to in the evidence and the butt was left blank. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the cheque was part of a ""kite flying"" exercise to temporarily place credit in the accused's account. The transaction was orchestrated by the accused without Mr Sukkar's knowledge.Count 4143. On Thursday, 5 December 2002 at 5:04 pm, there was a telephone transfer of $22,000 from Account 1 to Account 0354. On the same day, amounts of $3,900 (at 4:11 pm) and $20,000 (at 5:05 pm) were telephone transferred from Account 1 to Account 0354, a total transfer of $45,900. The three telephone transfers were undertaken on the 5233 telephone number. On the same day, cheques totalling $45,400 were debited to Account 0354, although they had been credited to Account 1 on 4 December. On 1 November, 2002, Account 1 had become overdrawn and it remained overdrawn, but the overdrawing was concealed because of related account transfers.144. The accused said that she could not have undertaken the telephone transfers at about 5pm, as she was nowhere near telephone 5233 at that time. She left the Landilo property and drove to the Landilo Post Office, where she deposited cheques at about 4:34 pm (Exhibit 16). On 5 December 2002, her daughter Rosemarie was working as an apprentice chef at an Annangrove restaurant. Rosemarie finished her shift at 5 pm (Exhibit JJ) and usually took 15 - 20 minutes to clean up and leave the work premises. It was the accused's invariable practice to arrive at her daughter's workplace at 5 pm for the purpose of collecting Rosemarie and driving her home. The drive from Landilo to Annangrove took at least 30 minutes each way. The accused's evidence was corroborated by evidence from Rosemarie and the restaurant supervisor, both of whom presented as honest witnesses.145. The Crown submitted that the accused may have undertaken the telephone transfer at Llandilo and been only slightly late to collect her daughter.146. However, having regard to the evidence of Rosemarie and the restaurant supervisor, I cannot eliminate the rational inference that someone other than the accused effected the relevant telephone transfer. I find the accused not guilty of this charge.147. For the reasons stated in para 28, I do not believe that the culprit could have been Mr Sukkar. 148. As I entertain a reasonable doubt about the accused's guilt on this charge, I take that doubt into account in relation to the other charges, particularly the charges relating to telephone transfers.Count 5149. On 12 December 2002 at 5:23 pm, $20,000 was telephone transferred from Account 1 to Account 0354 on telephone 5233. At 5:21 pm, $26,400 was transferred (a total of $46,400). Prior to the transfers, the balance in Account 0354 was $18.45. On 12 December, cheques for $16,700 and $13,000 were debited to Account 0354, although they had been credited to Account 1 on 11 December. In addition, on 13 December, there was a telephone transfer of $16,500 from Account 0354 to Account 2 (total $46,200). After the five transactions, the balance in Account 0354 had increased from $18.45 to $218.45.150. The accused said that she may have effected the transfer but, if she did so, it was on Mr Sukkar's instructions. 151. I have found that Mr Sukkar did not direct the telephone transfer of funds and did not know that funds were being transferred by telephone. The transfers were effected after business hours on a telephone to which the accused had access. Prior to the transfers, the accused's account had almost no funds. The effect of the transfers was to temporarily inflate the balance in the accused's Account 0354 and leave that account with a net gain of $200. The only available rational inference is that the accused effected the transfer of $20,000 for the purpose of obtaining credit in her account, and Mr Sukkar knew nothing of it.Count 6 152. On Sunday, 5 January 2003 at 12:34 pm, there was an ATM withdrawal at the St Mary's Leagues Club of $450 from Account 1. On that day, the accused was gambling at the Club. Her winnings were partly paid by cheques, totalling $1,400. On Monday, 6 January, 2003, there was a cheque deposit of $1,400 to Account 1.153. The accused said that, a few days before Christmas, she spent $450 on a Christmas party for Llandilo employees at the St Marys Leagues Club. The buffet cost $27 per person, and she paid for drinks. On the day of the party, she did not have a keycard with her. Mr Sukkar told her to reimburse herself by withdrawing $450 from an ATM on the next occasion that she was at the Club, and she did so on 5 January.154. Mr Woods said that the 2002 Christmas party was held at the St Marys Leagues Club, but there were only four attendees and the accused paid for only a few drinks. The accused was playing poker machines.155. The accused made ATM withdrawals at the St Marys Leagues Club on 23 and 30 December 2002. On 1 and 2 January, 2003, she used a keycard at the Panthers Club.156. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused withdrew the money for her own purposes - probably gambling - and the withdrawal had nothing to do with the Christmas party, which (based on Mr Woods' evidence) involved a significantly lower expenditure. Prior to 5 January, there was ample opportunity for the accused to obtain reimbursement for Christmas party expenditure, either by using an ATM or from petty cash. I accept Mr Sukkar's evidence that the accused was authorised to take Christmas party money from petty cash.Count 7 157. On Friday, 30 January 2003 at 11.56 am, $800 was withdrawn from Account 1 at a St Marys Leagues Club ATM, reducing the credit balance to $78:63. At 11:57am, $1,000 was telephone transferred from Account 2 to Account 1, $800 was withdrawn from Account 2 at a Club ATM, and $800 was transferred from Account 2 to the accused's Visa account. The accused was gambling at the Club and collected a winnings cheque for $119 (indicating winnings of $1,119).158. In relation to the ATM withdrawal from Account 1, the accused said that her brother asked her to make the withdrawal and give the cash to him, and she did so.159. I have found that Mr Sukkar did not know about Account 2 and did not know that the accused had a keycard for any business account. The withdrawal of $800 was not a straightforward cash withdrawal, but part of a ""kite flying"" exercise. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused withdrew the money for her own purposes - almost certainly, gambling - without her brother's knowledge.Count 8 160. At 5:57 pm on Tuesday, 11 March 2003, $19,350 was telephone transferred from Account 1 to Account 0354 via the 5233 telephone number. On the same date, cheques were debited to Account 0354 in the total sum of $19,300 ($9,600 and $9,700). They had been credited to Account 1 on earlier dates. The nett effect of the transfers was to bring Account 0354 from a debit balance to a credit balance of $49.76.161. The accused said that she could not have effected the telephone transfer as she would have collected her daughter from work and would not have arrived home by 5:57 pm. However, allowing for the usual clean up time of 15-20 minutes and a driving time of 30 minutes (the minimum time given by the accused), there was adequate time for the accused to collect her daughter and still effect the transaction.162. The accused also said that all telephone transfers which she effected were undertaken on her brother's instructions.163. I have found that Mr Sukkar did not direct the telephone transfer of funds and did not know that funds were being transferred in that way. The transfer was made out of business hours on a telephone to which the accused had access. The effect of the transfer was to bring the accused's account into credit. There is no available rational inference other than the inference that the accused effected the transfer without her brother's knowledge to obtain a credit to her account. Count 9164. At 10:32 pm on 2 April 2003, at a St Mary's Leagues Club ATM, there was a balance inquiry in relation to Account 1, followed by an ATM withdrawal of $300 from Account 1. At 12:25 am on 3 April, there was a further withdrawal of $100 from Account 1. On the same night, between 9:45 pm on 2 April and 12:33 am on 3 April, there were 5 withdrawals from Account 2, in the total sum of $1,350. The accused was gambling at the St Mary's Leagues Club on 2 April. She received a cheque payout for $500, indicating that her total winnings on 2 April were $1,500.165. In relation to the withdrawal of $300 from Account 1, the accused said that she withdrew the cash and gave it to Mr Sukkar.166. I have found that Mr Sukkar did not know that the accused had a keycard for Account 1. The location and time of the withdrawal, it's associaton with six other withdrawals and the fact that the accused was gambling on the day in question mean that the only available rational inference is that the money was withdrawn for gambling.Counts 10 and 19167. The facts in relation to these counts are similar.168. Count 10 At 11:39 am on Tuesday 8 April 2003, at the St Mary's Leagues Club, there was an ATM withdrawal of $800 from Account 1. On that day, the accused was gambling at the Club. She received cheque payouts of $183.55 and $900, indicating total gambling winnings of $3,083.55.169. Count 19 At 8:35 pm on Monday, 12 May 2003, at the St Mary's Leagues Club, there was an ATM withdrawal of $800 from Account 1. At 8:21 pm, $800 had been withdrawn from Account 2. On that day, the accused was gambling at the Club. She received a Club cheque for $761, indicating that her total winnings for the day were $1,761.170. The accused said that, in each case, she withdrew the sum of $800 at her brother's request and gave the money to him.171. I have found that Mr Sukkar did not know that the accused had a keycard for Account 1. On the days in question, she was gambling at the location of the ATM withdrawal. In relation to each count, the only available rational inference is that the accused withdrew the money for her own purposes, probably gambling. Count 14172. On Friday, 2 May 2003, cheque 1951 for $2,500 drawn on Account 1 was credited to Account 7055. It was not until the following Monday that the cheque was debited to Account 1. The cheque butt contains no details as to date or payee. On 2 May, $800 was withdrawn from Account 7055 and, on 5 May 2003, $1,000 was withdrawn from the account. Although Account 7055 was supposedly an investment account, prior to injection of the $2,500 cheque, the credit balance in the account was eight cents.173. The accused said that the money was wages for herself and her husband. Mr Sukkar would tell her how much was payable, and she would make out the relevant cheque.174. I have found that Mr Sukkar thought that wages were being paid by the cashing of a cheque and the distribution of the cash. The sum does not accord with the wages amounts of which any witness gave evidence, and no details were recorded on the butt. The accused's account was in dire need of funds. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the deposit was made without Mr Sukkar's knowledge, for the purpose of obtaining a credit to the accused's account.Counts 11,12,13,15, 16 and 17175. The facts relating to each count are similar.176. Count 11 At about 8:51 pm on Thursday, 24 April 2003, there was a telephone transfer of $32,000 from Account 1 to Account 0354, using the 5233 telephone number. On the same date, cheques in the total sum of $32,000 ($16,600 and $15,400) were debited to Account 0354, although the cheques had been credited to Account 1 on the previous day, utilising the Llandilo Post Office. The accused's writing and signature appears on the cheques and deposit slips.177. Count 12 At 6:30 pm on Monday, 28 April 2003, there was a telephone transfer of $35,750 from Account 1 to Account 0354, using telephone number 5233. Cheques in the total sum of $35,600 ($17,850 and $17,750) were debited to Account 0354 on 28 April, although they had been credited to Account 1 on 24 April, utilising the Llandilo Post Office. The accused's writing and signature appears on the cheques and deposit slips. 178. Count 13 At 5:45 pm on Thursday, 1 May 2003, there was a telephone transfer of $36,100 from Account 1 to Account 0354, using the 5233 telephone number. On that date, cheques totalling $35,850 ($17,950 and $17,900) were debited to Account 0354, although the cheques had been credited to Account 1 on 30 April, utilising the Post Office. The accused's writing and signature appears on the cheques and deposit slips.179. Count 15 At 7:26 pm on Friday, 2 May 2003, there was a telephone transfer of $49,100 from Account 1 to Account 0354, effected on telephone number 5233. On 1 May 2003, cheques totalling $48,850 had been drawn on Account 0354 and credited to Account 1 by Post Office deposit, although it was not until 2 May that the cheques were debited to Account 0354. The accused's writing and signature appears on the cheques and deposit slips.180. Count 16 At 6:47 pm on Monday, 5 May 2003, $46,500 was telephone transferred from Account 1 to Account 0354, using the 5233 telephone number. On Friday, 2 May, cheques totalling $45,400 had been drawn on Account 0354 and credited to Account 1, utilising the Landilo Post Office, although the cheques were not debited to Account 0354 until 5 or 6 May. The accused's handwriting and signature appears on the cheques and deposit slips.181. Count 17 At 8:10 pm on Wednesday, 7 May 2003, $18,200 was telephone transferred from Account 1 to Account 0354 utilising telephone number 5233. On 6 May, a cheque for $17,900 had been drawn on Account 0354 and credited to Account 1 via a deposit at the Post Office, but it was not until 7 May that the cheque was debited to Account 0354. The accused's handwriting and signature appears on the cheque and deposit slip.182. In relation to each count, the accused said that, if she was responsible for the transfer, she did it on Mr Sukkar's instructions.183. I have found that Mr Sukkar did not know about the telephone transfer of funds or ""kite flying"". Each transfer was done out of business hours on a telephone to which the accused had access. The transfer created a large temporary credit to the accused's account. Except in the case of Count 11, at the end of the ""kite flying"", there was a nett credit to the accused's account. Each episode was associated with cheque deposits which must have been undertaken by the accused as her writing appears on the documents and the cheques were deposited at the Llandilo Post Ofice. In relation to each count, the only available rational inference is that the accused effected the transfer without her brother's knowledge for the purpose of obtaining a credit to her account, at least on a temporary basis.Count 18184. On Thursday, 8 May 2003, cheque 1947 for $4,500 was drawn on Account 1 and credited to Account 7055, although it was not until the following day that the cheque was debited to Account 1. The cheque deposit of $4,500 increased the Account 7055 balance from $700 to $5,200. On 8 May, there were four withdrawals from Account 7055 in the total sum of $3,000. Further transactions on 9 May left a balance of $100 in Account 7055.185. The accused said that the four withdrawals totalling $3,000 were undertaken at Mr Sukkar's direction, and the cash was given to Mr Sukkar. Mr Sukkar used the $3,000 to purchase a new home computer. The balance of $1,500 was wages paid to herself and her husband.186. The accused's version does not explain why there were four withdrawals from Account 7055, rather than one withdrawal of $3,000, or why the $3,000 was not withdrawn directly from Account 1. Witnesses other than the accused and her husband said that wages were usually paid on a Friday, not a Thursday. Account 7055 was said to be an investment account, but it did not manage to accumulate savings and the deposit enabled immediate and substantial withdrawals to be made from the account. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the deposit was not made innocently, but for the purpose of obtaining a credit against which the accused could draw.Count 20187. At 9:50 pm on Tuesday, 20 May 2003, $66,150 was telephone transferred from Account 1 to Account 0354 using telephone number 5233. On 19 May, cheques totalling $68,300 had been drawn on Account 0354 and credited to Account 1 by deposit at the Landilo Post Office, although it was not until 20 May that they were debited to Account 0354. The accused's writing and signature appears on the cheques and deposit slips. The ATM card activity report shows that, in the early hours of 20 May and at about 1 pm on that day, the accused was at the St Mary's Leagues Club. On 21 May, the Club paid her a cheque for gambling winnings. On 20 and 21 May she was at the Panthers Club. 188. The accused said that she could not have made the telephone transfer because she was at Westmead Hospital with her father and other family members. Her brother-in-law, Bob Khalil, was called to support the accused's claim. However, in cross-examination, he conceded that he could not be sure about the time at which the accused left the Hospital.189. I have found that Mr Sukkar did not know about the telephone transfer of funds or ""kite flying"". The transfer was done late at night on a telephone to which the accused had access. The transfer benefitted the accused's account. It was associated with cheque deposits which must have been undertaken by the accused as her writing appears on the documents and the cheques were deposited at the Llandilo Post Ofice. The only available rational inference is that the accused effected the transfer without her brother's knowledge for the purpose of obtaining a credit to her account, which was almost certainly associated with gambling.Verdicts190.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Caleb Shae-Locke and Alfred Smith live together in a relationship. They also committed together a serious criminal offence involving the ongoing supply of drugs. They appear to have been equally culpable as far as the offence was concerned, and no suggestion has been made to me by either lawyer appearing for them that one was more heavily involved in the offence than the other, and I will treat them accordingly. 2 They were both drug users, (although there is some suggestion that Mr Shae-Locke may have given up drugs shortly before the commission of this offence, he was certainly addicted to drugs at around the time that the offence was committed). The police went to their home on 19 November. The officer who went was in plain clothes and pretending not to be a police officer. He indicated a desire to buy some drugs. He gave a hundred dollars to Mr Smith, who then left the premises while the undercover officer remained with Mr Shae-Locke. Mr Smith returned and handed a small green plastic balloon to the police officer. He had earlier asked for ice, but what was supplied was heroin, Mr Smith explaining that there was no ice available. The contents of the balloon when analysed were found to be heroin with a net weight of .08 grams. 3 Two days later the undercover officer was back at the premises of the accused. A similar thing occurred. Mr Shae-Locke had agreed to supply the undercover officer with one hundred dollars worth of ice and three hundred dollars worth of heroin. This conversation occurred on the telephone before the police officer went to the premises. When he got there the officer handed over money and received in return two small plastic green balloons containing .17 grams of heroin and two resealable plastic bags which contained .07 grams of methylamphetamine. 4 Six days later another incident of supply took place. Once more there was a telephone conversation and the undercover officer spoke with the two accused. During the conversations it was agreed that he would purchase a hundred dollars worth of methylamphetamine in the form of ice and three hundred dollars worth of heroin. The undercover officer went to their home later that same day, where he was handed some small packages after giving Mr Smith and Mr Shae-Locke $400. When the drugs were tested it was discovered that the police officer had not got what he ordered. He received .27 grams of heroin, but the other substance proved not to be a prohibited drug at all. 5 The two men were arrested on 16 December 2008. During the course of dealing with Mr Shae-Locke he became agitated and managed to pull off a handle from a security door. He therefore asks that I take into account when sentencing him an offence of malicious damage to property on the basis that he was reckless at the time. I will take that matter into account, but given the severity and seriousness of their drug supply conduct it has little effect on the overall sentence. Mr Smith has been in custody since the day he was arrested on 17 December 2008. Mr Shae-Locke was in custody for fifty-seven days before being released to bail, so I will backdate the sentence I will impose upon him to take account of that pre-sentence custody. 6 The offences of course were serious. The quantities involved were relatively small; in fact in total the two men supplied only .59 grams of prohibited drugs. But it is the regularity with which they did so which makes the offence serious and requires that a custodial sentence be imposed on both men. 7 Both of them had less than ideal upbringings. Mr Shae-Locke suffered two sexual assaults performed upon him as a child. He was taken out of the custody of his mother due to her physical abuse of him at a young age, and has spent time working as a prostitute. Despite those challenges to his life, it wasn’t until he started a relationship with his co-offender Mr Smith that he began to use drugs and began to commit criminal offences. He has a prohibited drug matter on his criminal history, but that is all. The matters put before me also suggest that apart from his criminal activities he is a man of good character and is capable of being - if I can use this term without being condescending - a worthwhile citizen. He has worked in the past and has acquired qualifications in the hospitality industry, but such was the position that he found himself with his partner, both drug users, that he has not been able to gain work for some time.8 Mr Smith’s upbringing was also less than ideal. In particular there was an incident where his father fell down some stairs and suffered some neurological damage. His mother blamed him, which caused him to move in with his grandmother. His father and his grandmother were supportive carers, but despite that the offender commenced committing criminal offences. He has a significant criminal history involving custodial matters for offences such as break enter and steal and drug use convictions as well. He has health problems, both through drug use and also accidents. He suffered a stroke in recent times. In Mr Smith’s case his drug use commenced at a fairly early age. He was associating with a number of other people who were drug users and also with a group of paedophiles who groomed children with alcohol and heroin before sexually assaulting them. 9 Both offenders expressed the desire to overcome their drug addictions. The offence was committed in the context of their being drug users in that I am told that they had accumulated drug debts which they intended to pay off by making money through drug supply. There is however no evidence that I can accept that they would have stopped their drug supply activities in the absence of being arrested by police. Both offenders pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and so I will discount the sentences that I would otherwise impose upon them by twenty-five per cent to reflect that circumstance. 10 As I mentioned at the outset of these remarks on sentence, the objective gravity of their conduct is identical. They were together conducting the drug supply activities with no one offender being more culpable than the other. On the other hand, it is of significance that Mr Shae-Locke has a criminal history of much less seriousness than his co-offender. He is entitled to be afforded leniency because of that, and so the sentence I impose upon him will be shorter than the sentence I will impose upon Mr Smith to reflect that circumstance. 11 Notwithstanding that the quantities involved are small, street level drug supply activity such as this are serious. Parliament responded to ongoing supplies of small drug quantities by creating s 25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act and providing that those who do what the offenders did are liable to the same maximum penalty as if they had supplied a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug. It is important to bear that in mind when I assess the appropriate sentence to impose upon these two men. 12 In Mr Smith’s case he is sentenced to imprisonment. That is to date from the day of his arrest, 17 December 2008. I set a non-parole period of eighteen months and a head sentence of three years. The non-parole period will expire on 16 June 2010, on which day he is to be released to parole. 13 In Mr Shae-Locke’s case he is sentenced to imprisonment that is to date from 2 July 2009 which I understand to be fifty-seven days prior to today. I set a non-parole period in his case of twelve months and a head sentence of two years. His non-parole period will expire on 1 July 2010 on which day he is to be released to parole. As is clear, I have found special circumstances in both cases and they relate to the need to assist both offenders to overcome their drug addictions.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Lillian Miles appears for sentence today on three offences. The first is an offence of larceny, in this case an offence more precisely described as shoplifting. The second offence for which the offender is to be sentenced is one of assaulting a police officer while that officer was executing his duty and by that assault occasioning to him actually bodily harm. (That is an offence that carries a standard non-parole period). The third offence, is in terms of its maximum penalty, the most serious. That is an offence of using an offensive weapon with intent to prevent her lawful apprehension whilst she was in company.2 The offender planned to commit the larceny, but she did not plan to get caught. The first of the offences was therefore something that she intended to commit when she commenced her criminal activities that day. The other two offences were offences that she decided to commit in order to avoid her apprehension for the first of the offences. 3 The offender was in a store selling handbags in the Pitt Street Mall on 7 June 2006. Also in the store was an off duty police officer. He appears also to have been there on some form of shopping expedition. He became aware of the offender and another female with her. He saw her put a handbag over her shoulder, look around towards the shop assistant and then run away with her co-offender. The officer commenced to pursue them. He pulled out his police badge and warrant card, showed them to the two offenders, and ran towards Ms Miles. He grabbed her and said  
     
      
       
      “I’m Constable Ferris from Sydney Central Police Station. You’re under arrest for stealing, stop there right now.” 
      
    4 Of course the offender should have stopped there right now, but she did not. Instead she committed the other two offences that I have referred to. She took a pen from somewhere upon her and lunged at the officer with that instrument. He believed she was holding a syringe. She was able to make contact with his torso and abdominal area with that pen. In fear of the item being a syringe the officer released his grip upon the offender. At the time the offender was attempting to inflict injury on the police officer with the pen. Her co-offender was standing nearby yelling “stab the cunt, stab the cunt”. 5 The officer then attempted to secure the instrument held by the offender by grabbing her arm. He did succeed in causing her to drop the instrument to the ground, but still she did not stop. She began to hit the officer with a closed fist, causing his nose to bleed and caused also swelling and bruising to his left eye. She then ran away again. Again the officer grabbed her and pushed her to the ground. Again the offender should have stopped, but again she did not. This time she began to bite the officer, doing so on many occasions. 6 Whilst this was happening the co-offender approached. She kicked Constable Ferris in the head and spat on him. The offender said “I’ll stop, I’m sitting down”. But she did not stop, she once again tried to run away. The officer again caught up with her. She continued to struggle and she spat at him too. She once again tried to bite him as she had in the past. Another off duty police officer was nearby and he saw what was happening so he came over and assisted the first of the officers to whom I have referred. Finally, the offender was apprehended. Other police officers, this time uniformed, arrived and put her into a caged truck. 7 As a result of the two offences of violence the officer received some injuries to his face, his legs, his arms and I have seen photographs depicting the nature of those injuries. They are significant injuries, they are not minor indeed. But perhaps what is of more impact upon the officer was the fear that he felt. As I have mentioned he was spat upon and bitten. There was clearly a possibility that he was exposed to some disease as a result of these actions by the offender. The impact that that fear had on the officer is obvious and foreseeable. The impact extended beyond him of course, but it is primarily the impact on him with which I am concerned. The injuries and the fear, indeed all of the consequences for the officer were entirely foreseeable. I have borne them firmly in mind when deciding the sentence to impose upon the present offender. 8 She is an Aboriginal woman of twenty-six years of age with a significant criminal history. A psychological report suggests that she has much to contribute to the community. Intelligence testing suggests that she is in the high average range. She is the fourth of six children to her mother, Lorraine Brown, and her father who died only recently. As she was growing up her father was said to have been excessive in his discipline, at times giving her beatings without explanation. 9 Her mother was apparently one of the stolen generation and was herself abused in a children’s home in Cootamundra. This no doubt had a significant impact upon Ms Brown and it in turn would have had a significant impact on the way she brought up and cared for her daughter. 10 The offender was also exposed to violence in her relationships with men once she became an adult. She has, for example, a broken tooth which was occasioned during an incident of domestic violence. 11 The offender gave evidence today and pointed out the difference between her attitude whilst living in the Redfern area and whilst living in a different part of the state, in particular her drug use. The offender began using drugs at a reasonably young age until she became addicted to heroin. Almost universally it is to be found that property offences such as these are committed for the purposes of supporting a drug habit. 12 There is some prospect for the offender’s future, but the prospects of rehabilitation depend on the offender becoming rehabilitated from her drug habit. The link between the offender’s criminal offences and her drug use is clear, although I do note there are on the offender’s criminal history some offences committed at a time when the offender said she was drug free. 13 Another factor suggesting the possibility of the offender remaining drug free related to the period where she was drug free after release from prison on 9 January 2004. At that stage she was in charge of three young cousins. In a presentence report the offender attributes her change of attitude to the fact that she had those responsibilities as well as of course her loss of contact with her prior associates. She relapsed however, early in 2006, once the children left her care and once a man with whom she was in a relationship committed a serious criminal offence. It was in those circumstances that she found herself on 7 June 2006 committing the offence of larceny to gain something to support her drug habit and when she was detected acting in a very violent way to avoid apprehension. 14 The offences committed on the police officer were obviously serious. The fact that one of them carries with it a standard non-parole period is an indication that parliament and I believe the community, is concerned about the level of violence inflicted on police officers who are simply doing their jobs. Those jobs are often thankless and usually difficult. It is incumbent upon the courts to support police officers, who after all are only attempting, as on this occasion, to prevent criminal offences being committed or to apprehend criminal offenders after offences have been committed. 15 Although the offender pleaded guilty, the standard non-parole period remains as a guidepost. Mr Ryan, for the offender, submitted that objectively the offence would be no higher than the mid-range. I agree. I find that objectively the sentence is in the mid-range having regard to the nature of the injuries inflicted on the officer, the way in which those injuries were inflicted and the circumstances in which they were inflicted.16 Of course that finding is complicated by the fact that a weapon was used for part of the assault, but that circumstance is covered by another offence. I will depart however from the standard non-parole period because of the plea of guilty, because the offences of violence were unplanned and because I accept that the offender is remorseful for what she did to the officer. 17 I cannot say that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation or that it is unlikely that she will commit further offences. As I have mentioned, there are some prospects, but I cannot say that they are good. They will largely depend on the offender overcoming her drug addiction, something which has been achieved only temporarily in the past.18 For the larceny offence was planned, but not the other offences. As I have indicated the offender was remorseful for what she did to the police officer. 19 The offences involving violence involved a series of such assaults. That is multiple acts. 20 The offender is not entitled to any leniency on the basis that she has little or no criminal history. I will give effect to the principle of totality by imposing concurrent sentences for the offences of violence, but they will come after a short fixed term for the offence of larceny. I have given effect to the plea of guilty by discounting the sentence that I would otherwise have imposed. The overall sentence in the absence of a plea of guilty would have been one of three years. But taking into account the plea of guilty, these are the orders I make.21 The offence of larceny I sentence the offender to imprisonment for a fixed term of six months commencing on 13 October 2006. That date, it is agreed, takes account of presentence custody served by the offender. 22 For the two other offences I set a head sentence of two and a half years with a non-parole period of nine months to commence on 13 April 2007. The non-parole period will expire on 12 January 2008 on which day the offender is to be released to parole. The fixed term for the larceny offence results from the sentence imposed on the other matters.

    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: Thomas Joseph appeals against sentences imposed upon him at the Parramatta Local Court for four offences. Two of those offences occurred on 28 January 2006, one occurred on 4 February 2006 and the final offence occurred two years ago, on 11 December 2004. Of the two offences that occurred in January this year, one was driving whilst disqualified and the other was an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in circumstances as will soon be seeing of what he has identified correctly, as road rage.2 The offence on 4 February 2006 was an offence of driving whilst disqualified. The offence on 11 December 2004 was an offence of driving whilst disqualified. It was in fact the fifteenth occasion to that point in time, if my counting is correct, that he had driven whilst disqualified. The two subsequent offences now bring up to seventeen the occasions that he has driven whilst disqualified.3 The Probation and Parole Service reports that the appellant is having difficulty understanding why it should be so that his driving whilst disqualified is something that can land him in gaol. Let me see if I can make it clear. There is no inherent right to drive on public roads. The roads do not belong to him, they belong to the government of New South Wales, or in some cases the federal government. It is the government who repairs them, makes them, marks them and who maintains them. And it is a matter for the government who will be allowed to drive on their roads.4 The government licences those people who are allowed to drive upon its public roads. The dictionary definition of licence includes “to permit”, “to allow”. The driving licence that one is given is always conditional upon obeying the rules of the road, so that when a licensed driver sees a sign saying 60 KPH, it is a condition his/her licence, that he obey that sign. Another condition of an issued licence is that the license driver will not drive when he/she has more alcohol in him/her than is allowed.5 The government who makes the roads, maintains the roads and permits others to drive upon the roads, has an obligation to ensure that all licensed drivers can move on the roads safely. If a driver is driving on those roads with more than the prescribed concentration of alcohol or at a speed greater than he should be driving, then that driver puts in danger those others who are allowed on the government’s roads.6 Those roads that the appellant is driving on are not his roads but the government’s roads. The government has an obligation to ensure that people who drive on its roads are safe drivers. It does that by putting conditions on the licence. From time to time the government [prosecution] will approach the Court arguing that because of the way in which a person has been driving, that person is no longer entitled to drive upon our roads. It asks the Court to make an order disqualifying the driver.7 The Court’s first recourse is to make the order to the person who stands before the Court for sentence. If that person sticks his finger up in the air and says, “Well I am not going to listen to that order,” the Court looks to the man in the uniform over on the side who works with Corrective Services and says: 
     
      
      “We tried to make an order for this man and he wouldn’t listen to us, so we are making an order now for you to keep him in custody for a period of time because he will not listen to us.” 
      
    8 The police are charged with making sure that people who do not have a licence or permission to drive do not drive. They do that firstly when they speak to people and see them driving in the incorrect way. They ask to see their licence.9 But secondly, from time to time if they see a driver who for some reason attracts their attention, they will feed the registration number of his car into their computers to find out whether that man has any record, or the owner of that vehicle has any record. That happened in this case.10 The appellant before me was pulled up on 4 February as a result of a computer check before the police had even spoken to him. I mention that because many drivers who are not allowed to drive think they will not be detected if jump into their cars and drive, not knowing that the police are always checking to see if the cars that are going past them have drivers that are authorised to drive. 11 To say to anybody “I’m entitled to drive whether I'm licenced or not” is a nonsense. You do not pay for the roads, you do not maintain the roads, you do not set conditions for other people on the roads. That is all done by the government, so it is the government regulations that determine who can and who can not drive upon its roads.12 I can assure you that every time you come back to this Court or any other court, having driven whilst you are disqualified, given your record of seventeen occasions when you failed to obey the order of the Court, the Court will look to Corrective Services to ensure that you stay off the road for a period of time. It is likely to be longer than the periods I am currently setting. If you like gaol, you continue to drive. If you do not like gaol, the message is simple. Do not drive anymore.13 The maximum penalty that has been imposed upon the appellant can only be reserved for the worst category of cases. It is true that an aggravating feature of the appellant’s driving is his terrible record in the past. Section 21A makes the point that a record can aggravate an offence, and indeed it does in this occasion. But if one is to look at the objective criminality of the offence otherwise, there is nothing about the manner of his driving on either of these two occasions, that is the occasion in January and the occasion in February, which suggests that it was a driving which required a maximum penalty.14 The driving on 28 January has the second aggravating feature which is that the offender was impatient with the driver in front of him. Anybody who has driven through Newtown knows it is not an easy place to get through. His impatience was such that ultimately he alighted from his car to assault the driver of the car in front of him. That, of course is separate charge. The second aspect of the maximum penalties is the Court below does not appear to me to have recognised and given any credit for the pleas of guilty. It seems to me that these pleas of guilty were early entered and had a utilitarian value. Some acknowledgement should have been given for that.15 Twenty months imprisonment with a nine month non-parole period for the January and February offences. In respect of the suspended sentence of two years, the criminality involved in that offence is not nearly as great as it is in the three that I am dealing with, and I intend to reduce that penalty to one of fifteen months with a nine month non-parole period.16 The fifteen month sentence for the first offence is the one that I will impose first, and that is to date from 4 February, so nine months from 4 February 2006 to 3 November 2006 with the balance of term of six months to 3 May 2007. In respect of the January and February offences of this year, twenty months to date from 4 November, a non-parole period of nine months to expire on 3 August 2007. I find special circumstances and I make a balance of term of eleven months to expire on 3 July 2008. I order the release of the appellant on 3 August 2007 pursuant to s51 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I require the appellant as a condition of his parole to be supervised by probation and parole. I require him to attend the Pacific Islander Program for the duration, which I understand is an intensive four month program. Convictions recorded by learned magistrate confirmed. Period of disqualification confirmed. In the event that that program no longer exists, the matter can be re-listed before me at 2 o’clock.HIS HONOUR: I ordered his release on 3 August next year. .

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Glades Ammari appears for sentence after having pleaded guilty in the Local Court at an early stage to an offence of embezzlement. She also appears for sentence because the commission of that offence represented a breach of a suspended sentence imposed upon her in the Local Court for a similar matter. Ms Ammari has, through her dishonesty, embezzled a substantial sum of money over a significant period of time. There is no alternative but that she serve periods of imprisonment. 2 The offence which is the second in time occurred when the offender was employed by Ragi Packaging Services Pty Limited. This company is a medium size operation, employing twenty people. It has between 300 and 500 customers. Ms Ammari was employed as a receptionist, although she also had responsibilities involving invoicing customers for their purchases. Customers were to pay their invoices by electronic funds transfer, putting the money into the company’s bank account. In a remarkably simple but very effective way the offender managed to arrange for about forty customers to pay the money for their invoices not into the company’s bank account but into her personal bank account. She simply contacted those customers by email, fax or telephone and told them that the account that they were to pay their invoices into had changed. She gave them details of her account, thus between 4 May 2009 and 27 November 2009 those forty customers paid Ms Ammari rather than Ragi Packaging Services a total of $540,160.83.3 Not surprisingly the principals of the company had been noticing this loss of income. The managing director checked the accounts and believed that the financial circumstances of his company were due to economic factors, not realising what Ms Ammari had done. She was able to cover up her misconduct by providing various excuses as to why she was unable to provide reports which would have revealed her criminality to the managing director. Eventually on 27 November 2009 things came unstuck. The managing director inspected a particular account and realised that there were large amounts owing to the company. He then contacted sixteen of the forty customers. They told him that they had been paying, indeed one of the customers provided receipts. Those receipts showed that the money had been deposited not into the company’s bank account but into the offender’s personal bank account. The matter was reported to police.4 When the offender came back to work on 30 November 2009 she was confronted with her dishonesty. She admitted what she had done, well at least partially, telling officers from the company that she believed that she had taken about $160,000. The offender printed out some bank transaction records. After looking at these Mr Barack from the company asked her where all the money had gone. He said “the balance of your account shows $41,500, you took out $417,000”. (I interpolate here that the extent of the offender’s criminality was not then known.) “Where is all the money”? The offender said “I don’t know”. She then contacted her uncle. In that conversation she said “I’m in big trouble, I have done it again”. (I will return to the significance of the word “again” later on in these remarks on sentence.) Police then came to the company’s premises and arrested the offender.5 She participated in an electronically recorded interview and told police that she had used the money to fund her gambling addiction. It seems to be accepted by the Crown that the money has simply been lost through gambling. There is no suggestion that the offender has used the money to purchase anything or to fund an extravagant lifestyle. Indeed one of the circumstances relied on by Ms Hawkins for the offender concerns the financial situation in which the offender and her family now find themselves. 6 As I said, when contacting her uncle the offender told him that she had done it “again”. This is a reference to the offender’s misconduct while working for a different company for which she was sentenced on five offences of embezzlement with a further ninety-two appearing on a form one.7 Using an identical means of operation she was able to illegally obtain $120,000 from her former employer Peacock Brothers. For four of the offences she received a suspended sentence for twelve months but for one of them the suspended sentence was for eighteen months. The offender breached the conditions of the bond by committing this further offence in 2009, although the bond had only a few days to run when she committed the first act involved in the 2009 offence. The $120,000 odd that was obtained was fully repaid, not by the offender but by her uncle. Her parents then had to take on the burden of a mortgage, despite them being on the pension. Because of the offender’s now new offending her family will suffer significantly so in a financial way. As I mentioned the new offending involves a loss to the company of approximately $540,000. I will make orders shortly that the contents of Ms Ammari’s bank account, some $48,800 odd will be repaid to the company but in broad terms that still leaves a half million dollar loss.8 I received as evidence a document signed by one of the directors of Ragi Packaging Services setting out the consequences to him and his company of the offender’s crimes. They reveal precisely what could be expected, significant financial loss arising not only from the direct actions of the offender in taking money but also consequential financial losses. The company employed others to reconstruct accounts and to put the company’s paperwork back into order. The statement also reveals personal loss to people involved in the company, in particular the author of the statement who says that he is on antidepressant tablets and sleeping pills. That is entirely the sort of consequence that can be expected from gross misconduct of this kind. It is entirely foreseeable harm which the offender must have been aware of as she committed her offences.9 The offender had an unremarkable upbringing. She is now thirty-one years of age. Her family were stable and secure as she grew up. Her parents were hardworking and she was always well provided for. No other member of the family has committed a criminal offence. Problems started for the offender after she married at the age of twenty-seven. Although the first few years of the marriage were good, eventually she separated from her husband before her daughter was born. He has never seen their daughter. She also took upon herself the burden of a mortgage. It was in those circumstances that she began to gamble. That explains where $120,000 from the earlier matter has gone and the half million dollars from the later matter. Gambling is promoted as a harmless activity but in truth to many people it has the effect of destroying many aspects of their lives. But it must be recognised that people like Ms Ammari have a choice. They are not powerless to resist the urge to gamble. Once Ms Ammari had gambled away all of her own money she was then faced with a choice, would she continue to gamble, obtaining money illegally to do so or would she simply stop. It was her decision to keep gambling, it was her decision to embezzle money from her employer so that she could do so. It is true that in her mental state she was less able to reason about the wrongfulness of her conduct but she did have, as I have just explained, a choice as to whether she would commit these offences or not and in particular having offended on one occasion and having realised the consequences of her gambling behaviour, she had a choice about whether she would do it a second time.10 Another matter of relevance concerning gambling is that it is so common an explanation for offences of this type that if it had a significant impact on the sentence to be imposed upon a person it would significantly reduce the deterrent effect of sentences for this sort of crime. I do have to say that it appears that the decision to impose a suspended sentence on Ms Ammari did her no favours at all. In common with most people who receive the benefit of a suspended sentence of imprisonment all she heard was that she did not have to go to gaol. It is entirely possible that by receiving the suspended sentence she failed to have brought home to her the consequences of committing criminal offences. Even now she seems to be unaware of the reason that I will be imposing a significant sentence upon her, a significant sentence of imprisonment.11 She has been in custody since 7 October and says that gaol is not the place for her. In many respects gaol is not the place for anyone but she must go to gaol for a significant period of time for a number of reasons, the most important of which is perhaps the need to punish her for her wrongdoing. She also needs to be deterred from future misconduct of this kind and I note in this respect that whilst she was employed up until the time she went into gaol on 7 October she had not told her most recent employer about her criminal history, a matter that she agreed today meant that she was effectively being dishonest. In Ms Ammari’s case there is a need, more than most, to specifically deter her from future offending and finally of course she needs to go to gaol so that others in her position might be deterred from doing what she has done. Corporations can only really conduct their business by placing their trust in their employees. The offender, as is inherent in offences of embezzlement, has breached that trust in a significant way. The law is clear that when offenders such as Ms Ammari are detected substantial sentences must be imposed upon them in order to ensure the deterrent aspect of the criminal law. 12 Ms Ammari’s offending was very serious indeed. Three particular factors point to that conclusion. The first is that there were multiple criminal acts involved, not only did she contact a significant number of the customers but she also covered up her misconduct through other dishonest activity and every time she went to her bank and withdrew money from it she was reminded of her ongoing criminality. The second aspect of relevance to an assessment of the objective gravity of her conduct concerns the amount involved, a very significant amount indeed. The third aspect concerns the length of time over which her offending occurred, more than six months. Nor is there any suggestion that Ms Ammari was going to stop voluntarily. The only reason her offending came to an end was because it was detected.13 Ms Hawkins recognised that the hardship that has been occasioned to Ms Ammari’s family was not exceptional but because of the circumstances I will shortly outline the offender will do her time in custody harder than would otherwise be the case. As a result of her offending her parent’s home will have to be sold. Another result of the offender’s crimes is that her elderly parents have to care for her five year old child and because of a decision made by Ms Ammari her child is not even seeing her since she went into custody. These sorts of consequences are commonplace when breadwinners are sent into custody and so Ms Hawkins is right to say that the hardship is not exceptional but I repeat Ms Ammari’s knowledge of what she has done to her family will make her time in custody harder than it would otherwise be.14 Ms Ammari was remorseful in giving evidence before me today. She is, I am satisfied, ashamed and disgusted with her behaviour, particularly because of the effect it has had on her family but also because of the effect it has had on her employer. Despite my finding that her expressions of remorse are genuine it does not mean that the offender is unlikely to re-offend or that she has good prospects of rehabilitation. I cannot make those findings at all. There are areas of Ms Ammari’s behaviour which are of a great deal of concern and I am not at all satisfied that upon release from custody she is capable of leading an honest lifestyle without considerable assistance.15 I accept, as Ms Hawkins, said that a little bit of gaol will go a long way for the offender. Gaol is a terrible place, deprivation of liberty is but one aspect of a person’s time in custody. What is perhaps more awful is the sort of person that you have to deal with, Ms Ammari will not easily fit in with many offenders in prison. More than most, I expect that the sentence of imprisonment I will impose upon Ms Ammari will have a personal deterrent effect upon her. Were it not for that circumstance the sentences I will shortly announce would have been significantly longer. 16 I will discount the sentence I would otherwise have imposed upon Ms Ammari for the new offence by twenty-five per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of her plea. Because the principle of totality is of application here I have no alternative but to revoke the order for suspension made in the first offence but I will not impose a sentence for the second offence which is totally cumulative nor however will I make it totally concurrent for these separate acts of criminality. Ms Ammari needs to be separately punished.17 I take into account that for almost eighteen months she was serving her sentence in the community without committing further offences in deciding the extent of the accumulation. The Crown concedes that there are special circumstances in this case, it is the offender’s first time in custody and as I think I have made clear she will need an extended period of supervision on parole in order to promote her rehabilitation. The orders I make therefore are these.18 I revoke the order for suspension concerning the offence of embezzlement which the offender was dealt with in the Local Court and sentenced to imprisonment for eighteen months. I therefore set a period of imprisonment of eighteen months, to date from 7 October 2010. That is a fixed term for the sentence because of the sentence I will now announce. In the matter on indictment the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of eighteen months, to date from 7 April 2011 with a head sentence of three and a half years. That means that the overall effective sentence consists of a non parole period of two years, to date from 7 October 2010 and a head sentence of four years. The offender is eligible to be released to parole on 6 October 2012.

   JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: The appellant, Leonard Arthur Richards, was convicted by a magistrate of three offences. The first was an offence of hindering a police officer, Constable Lucas, in the execution of his duty. The second was assaulting Sergeant Novak, and the third was resisting Sergeant Novak. 2 These allegations all arose from a brawl which took place outside a hotel. It seems to be common ground that two of the appellant’s sons were involved in a fight either inside or outside the hotel. Indeed, they later pleaded guilty to affray. When police officers arrived they attempted to deal with a highly volatile situation. There was a person significantly injured inside the hotel, there were a number of offenders and people suspected of being offenders in the vicinity, there were a number of people clearly willing to act violently towards others and in particular police. It was a very difficult situation and one in which police are unfortunately thrust in to all too often. The attitude of one of the people involved can be conveniently summarised by the fact that he was wearing a t-shirt saying “Bring back the Biff” on it. Violent people fuelled with alcohol are highly dangerous and it is a very difficult job which police have to do in circumstances such as these. 3 One of the police to attend was Sergeant Novak. He observed other police officers trying to deal with people or actually trying to arrest people. He also saw the appellant. The appellant was the father of the people other police were trying to arrest. The appellant himself had had a bit to drink even though he was on painkillers for an injury which he had earlier suffered. The appellant was concerned about his sons' welfare. Sergeant Novak was concerned about the welfare of the more junior police officers and also concerned to ensure that nothing hindered them in the execution of their duty. Both the appellant and Sergeant Novak were motivated by honourable causes but they came into conflict in circumstances I will describe. 4 The appellant moved towards his sons and, according to Sergeant Novak, began to speak to the arresting officers. Sergeant Novak considered that the appellant was hindering the work of those officers, he moved towards the appellant and told him to leave. There is not much dispute that the appellant said to Sergeant Novak at one stage “They’re my sons.” He said at some stage also that they had done nothing wrong. Whether the appellant actually believed that or not was never made clear. 5 Cleary the sons had done something wrong and something significantly so, but in any case the appellant turned his attention to Sergeant Novak and Sergeant Novak turned his attention towards the appellant. What happened thereafter is the subject of dispute. The Crown case is based only on the evidence of Sergeant Novak. He said that he took hold of the appellant and pushed him away which caused the appellant to come back at him, pushing him, and in turn the appellant was arrested by Sergeant Novak. When told that he would be arrested he said “No way, you won’t be arresting me”, pulled out of his grasp and pushed him away again. After that Sergeant Novak said the appellant stood up, shaped up as if to fight, so he drew his baton and OC spray and used both of them against Mr Richards. 6 The appellant denied much of what I have just said. In particular he denied pushing Sergeant Novak and the case for the appellant can be summarised as saying that having used OC spray and a baton on the appellant, Sergeant Novak needed to justify what he had done and so he falsely made up a story about the appellant having pushed him on two occasions. Of course, it is not necessary for me to decide whether or not Sergeant Novak has made up a story, what I have to decide is whether the prosecution has proved the guilt of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. The appellant’s case was supported by two witnesses, a Ms Davis and a Mr Feary. 7 It is not entirely right to say that Mr Feary has no motivation for telling a false story, that is, it is not entirely true to say that Mr Feary has no motivation to lie, because he himself was charged by Sergeant Novak for a number of offences arising out of his conduct that evening. At the time of the Local Court hearing, those matters had not been dealt with. Ms Davis, was not charged with anything, but the suggestion was made that she had a motive to lie because she is the wife of someone who works for Mr Feary. I will bear those circumstances in mind when I consider the weight to be given to their evidence. 8 The first matter is easily dealt with. The Crown concedes that there is no evidence that Constable Lucas was hindered in the execution of his duty. Indeed, there is no evidence that he was even aware of the presence of the appellant whilst he was attempting to arrest one of his sons. Of course, it is entirely possible for a person to be hindered without being aware that they are being hindered, but the Crown concedes that in this case there is no evidence that Constable Lucas was hindered. 9 The second and third matters are not as easily dealt with. There is evidence in the prosecution case to establish both matters, but that evidence only comes from Sergeant Novak. I must therefore examine his evidence with care, bearing in mind the burden of proof upon the Crown. In view of the evidence from Mr Feary and Ms Davis, I cannot be satisfied to the requisite extent. 10 The magistrate was quite critical of Mr Feary’s evidence and I have to have due regard to those findings. The magistrate referred to the way Mr Feary gave his evidence, causing some reaction at the bar table. I will assume that the magistrate is right. The magistrate also referred to the circumstance that Mr Feary gave evidence about an attack by Sergeant Novak on the appellant which no one else mentioned, intending to suggest that Mr Feary had exaggerated things considerably. But it cannot be overlooked that Mr Feary’s evidence was also supported by Ms Davis, there were no such criticisms of her by the magistrate. As I have mentioned, there may be a possible motive for her to lie from her connection with Mr Feary and the fact Mr Feary himself was facing charges, and so I have had to look carefully at her evidence, in particular her cross-examination, to see whether she was shaken at all. I could see no evidence to suggest that she was not doing her best to tell the truth. 11 The Crown concedes that if I were to consider it reasonably possible that Mr Feary and Ms Davis were telling the truth, then it could not make out its case in relation to the remaining two matters. 12 For reasons which I have given, I do not consider that the Crown has satisfied me beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant pushed Sergeant Novak or resisted being arrested by him. The evidence of Ms Davis and Mr Feary is quite to the contrary and I consider it reasonably possible that they have given an honest and accurate version of the events which occurred. The result is that, for all three matters, the appeal is allowed and the convictions - they were not actually convictions in some cases but I will say the convictions are quashed.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: On 25 February 2009 a young woman was working alone in a Subway store down at Lee Wharf. She got to work just after 6.00 am and opened the store at 7.00 am. At about 7.25 the offender came in. He was determined to rob the young woman.2 He leapt over the counter and raised his clenched fist at her. Not surprisingly, she became very frightened. He said, “Shut your fucking mouth, don’t tell anyone. Where’s the money?” With that, he opened the till and took $300. He did say, in an effort to reassure the young lady, “I’m not going to hurt you, I wouldn’t do that,” but given his earlier aggressive behaviour and given the fact that he appeared to be on drugs, it is hardly likely that the young lady was reassured by those words.3 As he was leaving he looked at her handbag. She asked him not to take it and he said he would not. He then left the store and the victim called her employer who called the police. She then began to cry. She said she was very frightened by the robber, a matter which is easily understandable. As I mentioned, she was working there alone and she was very vulnerable.4 The seriousness of offences such as these is not only to be determined by the loss of property but also the effects on victims of robberies. There is no doubt that the victim of this robbery will be left with consequences for some time. It was a very frightening experience for her, a matter that has to be reflected in the sentence imposed upon the offender.5 Later on that very same day the offender committed an even more serious offence. He went to the Aldi store at Hamilton where there was a twenty-two year old young man working at the register. As he was serving a customer the offender reached over his shoulder and grabbed a $100 note from the cash register. When he went to remove other notes the victim of this offence grabbed hold of his wrist. In response, the offender punched him three times to the side of his face before fleeing with $183.40 in currency.6 Why did the offender commit these robberies, one of which is an aggravated version of the offence? He cannot explain it, but perhaps the best explanation comes from the circumstances in which the offender was arrested.7 He committed the Aldi offence at about 1 o’clock. Only an hour and a half later police saw him at a pub in Hamilton. He was sitting at a poker machine. The $100 note that he had taken from the Aldi store was inside the poker machine. The offender was sitting there gambling the money away.8 It is something of a pathetic reason that the offender would commit such a serious offence as the one I have just described, simply so he could go from the Aldi store to a pub and gamble away what he had just taken by force and violence.9 The offender has a significant criminal history and, indeed, has spent much of his life since the age of thirteen in custody. He was, in fact, on parole at the time of these offences for an offence of violence committed upon a Juvenile Justice worker. His parole was revoked not because of the commission of these offences but because he failed to report as directed, failed to provide details of his residence and failed to undergo drug testing as required. In those circumstances, it is appropriate that I commence the sentences I will shortly impose from today rather than the date on which the offender went back into custody, 25 February 2009.10 I have, however, taken into account in a substantial way the fact that he was on parole for only a very short time before being returned to custody and that this sentence will be accumulative upon that period since he was returned to custody.11 The offender experienced an unstable living environment as he was growing up. He was regularly moved between his parents’ and grandparents’ homes. He describes his grandparents, who brought him up mostly, as not giving him any appropriate boundaries. He says that he became involved with the wrong crowd, (a negative peer group in the words of a psychologist who interviewed Mr Sbrugnera and his background for the benefit of the court) and this led to anti-social behaviours, such as excessive alcohol use and criminality.12 The offender finished school in Year 7 and has not had any formal education since then. Nor has he ever been gainfully employed, with the result that he has had a lot of time on his hands which he seems to have filled in by anti-social and criminal behaviour. In those circumstances, it is simply impossible to find that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation. He, since a very young age, has really only known one life and that is a life of anti-social and criminal activities.13 I should mention that when I sentence the offender for the offence of aggravated robbery I am asked to take into account two matters on a Form 1. One is an offence of larceny where the offender simply walked in and removed the till from resale premises and another is an offence of goods in custody when a large number of items of jewellery were found in the offender’s possession.14 The offender pleaded guilty to the robbery matters at an early opportunity and so it is appropriate that I discount the sentences I would otherwise have imposed by 25 per cent to reflect that circumstance.15 I do recognise the offender is still a young man and that his rehabilitation is something that I should certainly not cast aside. That is one of the many reasons that I have found special circumstances in this case. It has also, of course, affected the overall sentence that I will impose.16 Also relevant to finding special circumstances is the circumstance, as Miss Hull pointed out, that these sentences will be cumulative on other sentences. On the other hand, there is one significant constraint to the extent to which I can vary the ratio of non-parole period to head sentence in the offender’s favour and that concerns the circumstance that on his release on parole the offender took advantage of his freedom simply by acting in a less than appropriate way, culminating in his arrest for these offences.17 The offender seems to have been under the influence of drugs, at least at the time of the first offence. That may explain matters perhaps but it is certainly not a mitigating feature. It is certainly not going to lead to a sentence any less than would have been the case if the offender had not been under the influence of drugs when he committed these offences.18 The conduct for which the offender is to be sentenced is serious. As I mentioned, the victims of robberies almost invariably bear the consequences of those offences for a considerable period of time. I have to say also that the first offence in particular was a cowardly offence committed on a young woman alone in the retail store by herself. And the second offence is, of course, the aggravated form of the offence because of the violence that the offender used against a man who was presumably seated at the register and scarcely in a position to defend himself.19 The sentences I impose are as follows:20 For the offence of robbery, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a fixed term of eighteen months to commence on 5 November 2009, that is today’s date.21 For the offence of aggravated robbery, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of one year to commence on 5 November 2010 and an overall term of three years. The offender will thus be eligible to be released to parole on 4 November 2011 and the effective sentence I have just imposed is one of four years with a non-parole period of two years.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Tunde Doja was convicted on 30 November, last year, on eight counts of obtaining a financial advantage by deception. There was a long trial at the end of 2007, which was some three years after these offences were alleged to have taken place, which was in the middle of 2004.2 At the trial the offender was also charged with a number of offences against the Commonwealth Corporations Act, but the jury could not agree on a verdict on any of those charges. There was a degree of coincidence between the elements of the Commonwealth offences and those of the offences charged in counts 13 and 14, particularly that the offender did not have a valid authority to give financial advice about particular investment products.3 The verdicts on those two counts were by majority, the rest being unanimous. Of course, majority verdicts are not a possibility in the counts under the Commonwealth laws. In my view, it is not improbable that the extremely complex drafting of the Commonwealth provisions, which necessitated a full day of legal argument before I directed the jury, followed by several pages of written directions, meant that the jury may not have understood what the essential elements were. Given that the experienced counsel who appeared for both the prosecution and the defence were as confused by the language of these provisions as I was, this is hardly surprising.4 That is not to suggest that the offender was guilty of those offences, but merely to emphasise the difficulty of obtaining a conviction for offences against such badly drafted legislation.5 The offences on which the jury found the offender guilty were committed while he was carrying on business as a financial or investment advisor. He managed to persuade a number of his clients to apply for what are called “margin loans” to acquire certain financial products. Because the jury did not agree, the offender was not convicted of the Commonwealth offences which, in essence, charged him with carrying on business as a financial advisor without the appropriate licence. That was also an essential element of counts 13 and 14, upon which he was convicted.6 The evidence about the state of his authority to act as a financial intermediary was quite clear. He certainly appeared to be an effective salesman. He had a number of clients who apparently trusted him and, indeed, in evidence today, I have received a number of references from people who had been his clients. With one exception, the former clients who gave evidence in the trial could be described as relatively poorly educated people who were somewhat greedy, but not wealthy. Most of them were skilled tradesmen or in similar occupations and could properly be described as “battlers”. All of them were attracted by the prospect of obtaining a significant financial reward for little outlay, which was, in effect, what the offender was offering. That, however, did not constitute the offences of which the offender has been convicted.7 The offender was able to offer his clients an apparent opportunity to make significant financial gains for virtually no outlay on their part. This was possible because Macquarie Bank Limited offered what were called “margin lending facilities”, that is loans which would enable investors to buy financial products. These loans involved considerable payments of fees and interest to the bank.8 The offender appeared to have represented to his clients that the income from the financial products which he was selling would be sufficient to cover the interest payments and other outgoings related to the margin loans. That, however, was not the conduct that gave rise to the offences charged in counts 7 to 12.9 The conduct which led to those charges was the completing by the offender of loan application forms on behalf of each of the victims. Because of those statements, which the jury found to have been made by the offender, each of the clients received the benefit of the loan. The applications were addressed to Macquarie Bank and related to margin loans. Each application form required the applicant to set out his or her assets and liabilities, income and expenditure. 10 In each case, the offender filled out this part of the application forms with information that he fabricated, in whole or in part. If he had any instructions from the client about their assets, income or liabilities, what appeared in the application forms was significantly different from what the clients gave evidence that they had told the offender.11 None of the clients said that they saw what was written in the application forms. Some of them denied ever having signed such forms. Others said that they had signed forms but left blank spaces in those forms so that the offender could complete them. What the offender wrote on the forms was not authorised in any way by the victims. In some cases, what was written was at least partially, and in some cases totally, fictitious.12 Because of those false statements the victims were made to appear to the bank to be people with either substantial assets or higher income than was the case. The purpose of this conduct was to influence the bank to make the loans to the offender’s clients. If that occurred, the evidence was that the offender, or a company controlled by him, would receive commission for arranging the loan. The offender or his company also stood to gain commission on the sale of the financial products purchased with the loan.13 It is clear that the victims were persuaded to enter into transactions which they appeared not to understand fully, because they thought they would gain a profit for little or no outlay. Each victim, except possibly Mrs El-Ali, who has a degree in business but little relevant financial knowledge or experience, was relatively unsophisticated. While some spoke English well, others did not. 14 The offender, by contrast, was experienced in the finance industry and was apparently extremely persuasive. He was clearly aware that what he did was not only deceptive towards the financial institutions but also that it exposed the victims, his clients, to significant financial risks and obligations which they had little hope of meeting, and I make those comments knowing that he has told the Probation and Parole Service that he did not believe that anything he did was wrong.15 The offences are, therefore, very serious. No physical violence was involved but the victims suffered great harm. I have received today some information from Macquarie Bank which suggests that the harm suffered by that institution was not as great as might have been imagined, but it was still significant. The harm to the individual clients appears to have been more significant. Some of them said they had suffered significant financial losses and, as I say, Macquarie Bank suffered losses. It is not clear whether the other financial institutions involved suffered losses, but they may well have done so.16 Although the offence charged in each of counts 13 and 14 is the same offence, the facts giving rise to those offences were different. In the case of those offences, the Crown alleged, and the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, that the offender obtained a financial benefit, namely commission on the sale of financial products, for himself or a company associated with him, by falsely representing to the company marketing the financial products that he was properly licensed to deal in products of that kind.17 The elements of each of those offences are, therefore, rather similar to what was alleged in each of the counts alleging breach of the Corporations Act upon which the jury could not agree.18 The scheme established by the Corporations Act for the licensing of financial intermediaries is designed to protect members of the public, especially those who may not be as sophisticated as others, in the market for financial services and products, from conduct of a false or misleading character, by ensuring that financial intermediaries have appropriate and up-to-date knowledge and qualifications and generally to ensure high standards of probity in the conduct of the financial industry and that makes these offences serious.19 The facts, as the jury must have found in this case, relate to precisely the kind of conduct which the legislation is designed to protect against. The offender, for his own benefit (possibly obtained through a company which he formed for the purpose) stood to gain considerable amounts of commission if he was able to sell financial products. The evidence was that, in fact he received significant amounts of commission from the transactions, and he was able to do so without regard to the level of sophistication and understanding of his clients, or their ability to meet the costs of the investment in the financial products which he sold to them.20 Each offence is similar in characteristics but each is quite discrete. The consequence is that the sentences imposed for the offences must be at least partially cumulative.21 I need to have regard to some of the matters set out in section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act as aggravating or mitigating circumstances. Perhaps the most important of these is the fact that the offender was in a position of trust. He held himself out as a financial advisor, his clients were not sophisticated, the financial institutions trusted him and he, by doing as he did, abused his position of trust. He was dishonest and inaccurate. That was true both in the case of the counts where he falsely completed the application forms and in the counts where he made false representations to the financial institutions.22 These offences were clearly committed for the offender’s financial gain and they were part of a well-planned and sophisticated continuing operation. The operation may not have been as sophisticated as some strategies that are devised to defraud people, but clearly the availability of the margin lending facilities, was something of which the offender took full advantage.23 The damage to the investors was clear; they were unable to meet the servicing charges on the loans and the bank had to realise its security, suffering a loss. The overall loss was not significant, it is probably slightly more than $100,000 or in that vicinity, but it is still significant.24 The offender, as I have said, has never admitted that anything that he has done is wrong and he appears not to understand that it was necessary for him to have a proper authorisation before he did what he did. The offences took place over a series of months. They were not isolated and they were, as I have said, part of an organised and planned course of conduct.25 I have mentioned the purpose of the legislation, which required the offender to hold the proper authorisation. Where people flaunt that legislative requirement the community requires that the breach be denounced and that people be deterred generally from committing the offences again. That is a serious factor in these proceedings.26 It is also important that Mr Doja come to appreciate that what he did was, in fact, wrong. The evidence was quite clear that at the relevant time he did not have a proper authorisation, and it must be well known in the community that anyone who wishes to act as a financial intermediary must take the trouble to obtain the proper qualifications and to become authorised, and to make sure that that authorisation is kept up-to-date.27 Mr Doja is now some fifty-two years old. He was born in Nigeria. He has been in Australia for more than half of his life. He has children here from two marriages, although he is currently single, but the evidence is that he has been attentive and caring towards his children and the evidence in the case, in fact, disclosed that some of the financial arrangements which he made were for the benefit of his daughter. 28 At the time of these offences, Mr Doja was the head of a substantial investment services company. He had a number of employees. He had premises in the Central Business District, which certainly impressed some of the witnesses, and he appeared to be a person who was being very successful. As I have said, he was trusted and he appeared to have some expertise. There is no doubt that he is a man who completed his schooling in Nigeria, not to tertiary level, but he obtained government employment in Nigeria. He then left to travel. He settled in Australia. He obtained qualifications in finance and accounting in this country and he clearly was a person of some sophistication and intelligence. He has a good employment record in government and in the private sector and he has acquired an accounting diploma and a graduate diploma in accounting.29 As a result of these offences and what was discovered after that, he was made bankrupt and his business was sold. He had to sell considerable property and certainly during the trial it emerged that he was bankrupt and had no assets. 30 He does not have any substance abuse problems and indeed, up until the time of these offences he seems to have been a model citizen. He has clearly had no trouble with the police, except for a driving offence, which I disregard for the purposes of sentencing, and he is a person of good character. However, even people of unblemished character commit offences for the first time. His good character is a factor that I do take into account, but it does not entitle him to undue leniency.31 While he has been in custody he has been examined by a respected psychiatrist, Dr Jonathon Carne, who, not surprisingly, finds that he had an adjustment disorder with depressed mood, which has become chronic. Dr Carne attributes this depressive reaction to a series of stresses, notably the trial, but also to one other factor, namely the fact that he has been on bail pending the trial and because of his bail conditions, he was unable to travel to Nigeria for the funeral of his father. He is the oldest of several children and he told both Dr Carne and the probation officer that the eldest son is expected to play a leading role in the funeral. His inability to do so has caused him distress. Clearly, he is suffering from a psychiatric condition and Dr Carne recommends that he be treated for it. I will direct that when he is returned to custody, a copy of Dr Carne’s report be provided to the Department of Corrective Services to go with him. 32 In the investment industry there are great temptations for those with relatively greater information and knowledge to exploit their position at the expense of others, who have less knowledge and less sophistication. Those who enjoy a privileged position in the finance industry must realise that the law exists to provide some protection to those who are less privileged than they are. If intermediaries contravene the law and exploit their knowledge and position at the expense of others, they must expect to be dealt with severely. For those reasons I cannot see that there is any alternative to a full-time custodial sentence for each of these charges. In some cases where a person has gained financially from criminal behaviour, as the offender did in this case, it may be appropriate to impose substantial fines.33 In this case I am satisfied that the offender has not retained any significant assets and has not salted the proceeds of his crime away, using devices designed to defeat creditors, a practice which is not unusual. Unfortunately, his individual clients, who have probably suffered relatively greater financial losses than he has, may not be able to recover their losses so easily. I regard the offences which caused direct harm to the individual clients of the offender, as being, in these circumstances, more serious than the offences where the harm was caused to corporate providers of financial products, who are better able to bear the losses.34 In the case of the offences charged in counts 13 and 14, the facts giving rise to each offence are similar and the offences were committed at the same time. Although the sentences for each of these sentences will be partly cumulative, on the sentences imposed on the other matters, they will be concurrent with each other.35 The offender has not previously been in custody and there is no evidence of any previous criminal activity. In addition I have the report of Dr Carne, so I find special circumstances for the purposes of the sentencing legislation. Also, because there are multiple offences, I must have regard to the principle of totality. 36 On each of counts 7 to 12 inclusive the offender is sentenced to a non-parole period of two years and a total term of four years. On each of counts 13 and 14 the offender is sentenced to a non-parole period of 18 months and a total term of three years. The dates of each sentence will be as follows: 
     
      
      Count 7, the non-parole period will commence on 1 February 2008 and expire on 31 January 2010. The total term will expire on 31 January 2012. On count 8, the non-parole period will commence on 1 May 2008 and expire on 30 April 2010. The total term will expire on 30 April 2012. On count 9, the non-parole period will commence on 1 August 2008 and expire on 31 July 2010. The total term will expire on 31 July 2012. On count 10, the non-parole period will commence on 1 November 2008 and expire on 31 October 2010. The total term will expire on 31 October 2012. On count 11, the non-parole period will commence on 1 February 2009 and expire on 31 January 2011. The total term will expire on 31 January 2013. On count 12, the non-parole period will commence on 1 May 2009 and expire on 30 April 2011. The total term will expire on 30 April 2013. The terms for counts 13 and 14 will be concurrent. In each case the non-parole period will start on 1 May 2010 and expire on 31 October 2011. The total term will expire on 30 April 2013. The first date upon which the offender will be eligible for release on parole is therefore 31 October 2011.

   JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: Matthew Hickson appears for sentence today after having pleaded guilty at an earlier stage to an offence of reckless wounding, the matter carrying a maximum penalty of seven years and a standard non-parole period of three years. The standard non-parole period is not of direct application because of his plea of guilty but it remains as an important guidepost. I note that the offender pleaded guilty in the District Court to an offence and so because of the Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act the maximum discount that I can allow because of that plea is 12.5 per cent. In this case the plea of guilty, and in particular at this stage as to the utilitarian benefit of that plea, is one of a number of factors which has led to not only the sentence being reduced by 12.5 per cent but also to me imposing a different form of sentence that that I would otherwise have imposed.2 Mr Hickson’s offence was committed in somewhat unusual circumstances when he threw a tomato sauce bottle at the victim of the offence. It appears to have been bad luck rather than anything else that led to the bottle actually hitting the victim on his forehead. Mr Hickson might have assumed that the victim would have seen the bottle coming towards him from twenty metres away and moved out of the way. For whatever reason the victim did not move, indeed the bottle struck him on the forehead and caused a laceration which required stitches, which also caused the victim to fall to the ground and briefly lose consciousness. There was a single wound. Although a weapon was used it was not used in a way which was guaranteed to injure the victim and I am satisfied that I should deal with the matter on the basis that Mr Hickson was reckless as to whether the victim would be injured rather than intending for that to happen. In fact it appears from the statement of facts that the bottle was thrown more to frighten and annoy the victim than it was to intentionally injure him. For those reasons I am satisfied that objectively the offence is significantly below the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of this type. 3 Mr Hickson is a man with a rather difficult background. It is set out in the report of Dr Jacmon tendered to me today by Ms Donnelly who appeared for the offender. I have in the past been very critical of Dr Jacmon’s reports. I have found that many of his conclusions are unjustified by the history he has taken and that almost every one, indeed every single one to be more precise, contains a statement to the effect that the commission of the offence was accompanied by impaired judgment because there appeared to be little thought given to the consequences. I alerted Ms Donnelly of my published views on Dr Jacmon so that she might seek appropriate instructions from her client. Initially she asked that I disqualify myself but after further discussion she withdrew that application. In any case I have no reason to doubt the history that Dr Jacmon obtained from Mr Hickson. 4 Mr Hickson’s background has been difficult and has involved drug use for a lengthy period. He has been maintained on methadone for a significant time. His dosage was reducing, which he found to be beneficial, but having recently suffered significant injuries in a motor vehicle accident in late September this year he said his methadone has been increased. He is in a relationship with a woman who has difficulties herself. She is currently at Odyssey House. She expects to complete the rehabilitation program there in the near future. One of the matters relied on by Ms Donnelly suggesting that I should not impose a full-time custodial sentence in this case, is that if I were to do so his partner would then have nowhere to live when she left Odyssey House, the Housing Department having the view that if no one is living in the premises then the arrangement cannot continue. However that would not prevent me from imposing a full-time custodial sentence if that was otherwise required. 5 Dr Jacmon diagnosed the offender with a number of matters, including a borderline personality disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. That latter matter relating to an attack upon Mr Hickson by a man and his dog, the man eventually being given a custodial sentence for it. There is no doubt that Mr Hickson’s mental state is more fragile than most. Any full-time custodial sentence would thus be harder on him than it would on other members of the community. 6 I have not mentioned Mr Hickson’s criminal history, it is significant. However, there is a pre-sentence report available which suggests that there is considerable hope for the future. In summary the report says Mr Hickson has a significant criminal history, however, in recent years there is no evidence of anti-social behaviour. He is in stable employment, stable accommodation and remains in a treatment program. The report speaks of the offender’s involvement with DoCS and the desire to maintain custody of his son, and that both he and his partner are resolved to working towards a drug-free lifestyle. The statement concludes the above factors auger well to continued improvement in their future livelihood. Of course because of the motor vehicle accident I referred to earlier, he is unsuitable for community service.7 I turn now to the appropriate outcome in this matter. Parliament has, through the setting of a standard non-parole period for offences of this kind, spoken about the seriousness with which he should be dealt with. On the other hand it is to be noted that charges such as these can be dealt with in the Local Court, which according to recent authorities can actually be taken into account in determining whether to impose the standard non-parole period. Even given the lack of intention as I have found for the offender to harm his victim, it is a serious offence for which a custodial sentence is required. I have determined the length of the appropriate sentence and decided that that sentence of imprisonment should be suspended. I note that quite properly, given the nature of the case before me, the Crown did not speak in opposition to that ultimate outcome. 8 The offender is therefore sentenced to imprisonment for a period of one year from today. The execution of that sentence is suspended for a period of twelve months pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act upon the offender entering into a bond to be of good behaviour for the duration of the sentence. The conditions applying pursuant to that bond are these: 
     
      
       
        He is to be of good behaviour. 
        He is to appear before this Court if called upon to do so at anytime. 
        He is to accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and in particular, should that Service require, he is to undergo treatment from either Dr Jacmon or some other form of health professional for the matters referred to in Dr Jacmon’s report.  
       
      
     9 Mr Hickson, what I’ve done is put you on a bond but it’s not just any sort of bond. It’s a bond that if you breach you go to gaol, you understand? It’s not a matter of coming back and trying to persuade me that some other form of sentence should be imposed, I have actually sentenced you to imprisonment and if you breach the bond you start serving the sentence. If you don’t breach the bond you don’t serve the sentence, pretty simple. Now, how can you breach the bond? Committing further offences is the obvious one. Another way is if you don’t do what Probation and Parole Service require. Either of those decisions by you, if you decide to commit an offence, if you decide to not the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service, you come back before me. Not any other judge. Not some probation officer. It is me that will deal with you and, as I have said, I have imposed a sentence of imprisonment upon you and if you breach it then you’ve got to serve it. Do you understand?10 OFFENDER: Yes, I do.

    JUDGMENTThis report relates onlt to the first of the two District Court Conviction Appeals referred to in paragraph 1.1. John Harold Weaver appeals against two convictions recorded by her Honour Magistrate Bapti in the Local Court at Narrabri on 28 July last year. The two convictions relate to two different incidents, both of them driving incidents. The first was a charge of driving whilst licence was suspended on 12 January 2005. The second incident related to driving whilst licence was cancelled on 27 August 2005. There is no dispute between the parties that on 12 January 2005 the appellant’s licence was suspended and there is no dispute between the parties that on 27 August 2005 the appellant’s licence was cancelled, nor is there any dispute in respect of the second matter that the appellant drove on the relevant occasion. There is a very lively dispute between the parties as to whether the appellant drove on 12 January 2005.2. The Crown tendered the transcripts of evidence given before the learned magistrate and her judgment in respect of both matters. It was clear during the running of the suspension matter that the appellant was claiming that a nephew was driving the vehicle and that he had had some difficulty for one reason or another being able to produce the nephew for court in circumstances where no inference adverse to him could be drawn from the absence of the nephew. 3. His Honour Judge Bell of this court gave leave to the appellant to call the nephew as a witness and in the circumstances today Jason Doyle has given evidence.4. The matter of 12 January, that is the drive whilst licence suspended matter, is to be determined therefore on the transcripts of evidence before her Honour the learned magistrate and on the evidence of Jason Doyle given this morning. The matter of 27 August, that is drive whilst licence cancelled, is to be determined solely on the evidence before her Honour on material of her Honour's judgment remarking on the credibility or believability of the appellant and on the law.5. The general effect of the evidence given by Doyle this morning is that he was a licensed driver who was visiting his uncle at the relevant time, that was early in 2005, and had visited with him overall for a period of a couple of weeks. On 12 January 2007 he was able to remember that day, he had been driving with his uncle to a hardware shop which was called Richardson’s, if memory serves me, to collect some items, bolts of some sort, to assist in the construction of a shed. That hardware shop, as I understand it, is in Ugoa Street. On the way home from there Doyle’s evidence is that they turned into a BP Service Station from Ugoa Street at a point in time where Ugoa Street is approaching the Highway. They drove into the service station continuing on in the direction that they had come from Ugoa Street, then did a right hand turn, drove through the bowsers and another right hand turn and parked in front of a carport or into a carport next door to the shop. Three photographs were tendered and in exhibit 2 one of them shows the carport referred to.6. Mr Doyle’s evidence was completed by photographs and a diagram. His evidence was that he left the car from the driver’s side and made his way into the shop for the purpose of purchasing fast food and some cigarettes. As he was making his way he saw for a second time a police vehicle now travelling basically in the same direction that he had travelled to get to the parking spot and heading towards the carport. He entered the shop, when he entered he had left his uncle seated in the car. He remained in the shop for a period necessary for the fast food to be prepared, and when he returned the police had gone and his uncle was seated in the car. He was informed by his uncle of the allegations the police were making against him, and he reassured his uncle that he would not be charged, because if he was to be charged, they would have taken him to the police station and done so.7. The issue for me to determine are these, has the Crown proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was driving the vehicle in circumstances where the accused upon his oath denies driving and says the nephew was driving and the nephew comes to court denying on his oath that the appellant was driving but claims that he was. Police, by contrast, say there was only one person in the car, the person was the driver and that that person was the appellant. As it seems to me that what the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that there was only one person in the car and that that person was the appellant.8. The first part of the appellant’s case was that the police would never have had an opportunity to see into the motor vehicle. For that purpose he tendered eight photographs which I have numbered now one to eight, more is the pity that they were not so numbered in the hearing. In the photo which I have numbered 1, which I will show everybody, is a front on photo taken from the front passenger corner of the vehicle looking into the vehicle. What can be seen in that photograph is that there is a driver and only one person in the vehicle. That person who is a driver is a male. He is wearing two garments on his top. He is a tallish male because you can also see through the window the sun visor, the sun visor is down and obscures part of his face, the top part of his face and his hairline. Through that window, that is the front windscreen, and quite possibly through the driver side window one can see the outline of a white shed so that one can demark the edges of the shed.9. In respect of photograph number 2 nothing much can be seen because there are reflections but one can see the steering wheel, the visor and a perpendicular line which may well be what I would call the back part of the vehicle.10. In respect of photograph number 3 what can be seen, and I am not looking through the open door but rather through - the test was whether one could see through the tinted glass, I can see through the passenger side glass and presumably the front windscreen a pink pillar, some object which I cannot quite define which has an angle here which would appear to be close to or associated with either the building or the car, and I can also see the rear white pillar of the motor vehicle.11. In photograph number 4 I can see one driver and one person only in the vehicle. I can see his chin line, I can see that he is without beard and without apparent facial hair. I can see again the two garments, they are the same two garments that the driver in photograph number 1 was wearing, and I am satisfied that the driver in photograph number 4 is the same person as the driver in number 1.12. Photograph number 5 I can see through what I understand to be the passenger side window and quite probably the driver side window, both of which are said to be tinted. I can see the continuation of a brick fence or a brick built up fence to a corner point and then going off at a different angle, convincing me that that house is a corner house. I can see a footpath going in a different angle to the footpath that is shown at the front of the windscreen, again convincing me that it is a corner block. I can see that there is no driver in the vehicle in respect of that photograph.13. Significantly photograph number 6, which is a photograph from the rear, I can only see the heat lines, I take it to be, across the rear windscreen for the purposes of demisting. I have looked and in fairness to the appellant, I cannot see the front windscreen or through the car at all to anything else.14. Likewise in photograph 7 I can see through the corner of the vehicle here to a situation where I can see the roofline of the red vehicle that is parked behind it and I can see some of the building structure of the white building behind. In fairness I cannot tell you whether there is a driver or not in that vehicle and I would not be confident about telling you whether there was a passenger in it. So it is fair to say that as a result of reflection, I am unable to see into that.15. In photograph 8 I can see the roofline of this vehicle, the fence line immediately above it, the hill but I cannot see the line of the roof, but it may be I cannot see that because it would be blocked out by in fact the white.16. So I am satisfied the police had sufficient opportunity to see into the vehicle for purposes of establishing whether there were one or two drivers (as said).17. The parties agree that once the car was parked, the appellant emerged from the passenger side. I am unable to be satisfied whether the appellant slid across because the only view I have of the rear does not persuade me that the police must have been able to see through to the vehicle.18. There is another reason why I have some difficulty with the proposition that it was seen his seatbelt was removed was if I can come back to photograph number 3 one can see the shape of the seats and it may well be that they would have caused an obstruction from anyone behind, particularly bearing in mind that to undo a seatbelt, one is working below the waistline and the rear window would not appear, particularly to somebody seated in a car, to give that view. But I am satisfied, and indeed it seems to be the case of both parties, that the appellant emerged from the passenger side.19. On the account given by Jason Doyle, there appears to be no apparent reason why the appellant would emerge from that side. That does not mean he would not have, it is just that there is no apparent reason. Doyle’s account also is that the appellant was seated there once the police had gone, which would mean that whatever reason it was that the appellant got out, that reason must have been satisfied when he got back in on Doyle’s account, and I have some difficulty, although it would not be overwhelming, but I have some difficulty accepting that, in other words I regard it as improbable rather than not happening.20. Then a conversation occurred between the appellant and the police. The conversation that the two police officers swear to on their oath is in these terms, Sergeant Bell said that he asked the appellant what he was doing driving the vehicle and the answer that he was given was that his son Phillip was working. Implicit in that answer are two propositions, firstly that Mr Weaver agrees with the proposition that he was driving his vehicle and gives an explanation for it, so it is an admission against interest, and secondly he gives an excuse which was that the son was working. There is no mention there of Newcastle. He was asked whether he said anything else and then this question and answer “Did you have any discussion with the accused in relation to the status of his licence?”, answer “I asked him if what he was doing was driving - what was he doing driving and he made no reply to that.”. That was a question which begged an answer on the case that the appellant is asking not only that he was not driving but that the person who was driving was in the shop.21. The appellant’s account is this, “I was not driving the van, I had my nephew who was driving the van, he was in the BP shop when the police allegedly said that they had seen me change seats in the van. He was purchasing cigarettes and food. I mentioned that to Sergeant Bell.”. I accept that the appellant was running his own defence and would not have known, but there was no challenge to the police officer’s evidence that he had said to the police officer that his son Phillip was working when asked what he, Mr Weaver, was doing driving the vehicle.22. Mr Doyle’s account is rejected by me. Significantly Mr Doyle’s account for why they did not go to the police station was that nothing was going to happen, but the evidence before the magistrate was, and was not challenged, that the appellant had been told he would be given a court attendance notice. I accept that he was so told because in fact a court attendance notice has been issued. I do not accept that he was given any field court attendance notice, although that may have happened, I just cannot make a finding one way or the other in respect of that, it would usually happen but there are occasions when it does not. But I am satisfied that he was told that he would be given a court attendance notice.23. Consequently when Mr Doyle, on his account, said to the appellant “Look they’re not going to charge you, they would have taken you to the police station to charge you.”, the immediate answer that should have sprung from the appellant’s lips were “I don’t know that you’re right about that because they’ve told me they’re going to give me a court attendance notice.”. There was no mention by the appellant of the court attendance notice.24. If one looks at the conduct of the appellant in the interaction to the police on either account, his conduct is consistent only with him being the sole person there. It is inconsistent with someone else being there. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt he was the only person there, it follows from that that I am satisfied he drove the car.25. In respect of the other matter the appellant’s evidence is that as a matter of precaution he had made inquiries with the Roads and Traffic Authority, Mt Druitt and was in the process of asking or receiving his licence back when the RTA employees told him they would not do business with him. He asked them why, they said because he had outstanding fines. They told him that he had to sort out those outstanding fines. He then asked “Is there any reason why I cannot have my licence. That is a different question from the one that he would like me to think was asked “Is there any reason why I cannot drive?”, they said “No there was no reason, there’s no action taken against your licence, it’s just over a fine default and you should sort it out.”. There was no impediment, as I understand - that answer has - of the RTA has to be understood against the proposition that there was no reason why he could not get his licence other than the outstanding fines that he had been talking about, or put it another way, there was no other reason why he could not get his licence.26. I have had some trouble sorting this one out in my own mind because the learned magistrate made a finding favourable to the appellant in terms of his credibility. Her Honour said “While I acknowledge and accept what you have indicated to the court, if it is effectively a strict liability situation, then my hands are tied.”. Her Honour may not have been entirely correct there, it seems to me that the position in respect of these type of offences may allow for some room for an honest belief reasonably held or held on reasonable grounds to be a defence.27. The first thing to note about Proudman v Dayman, 67 CLR at 536 (1941), was that the defence as advanced there did not succeed. It was a driving case as well. The judgment that most frequently is cited is that of Dixon J, as he then was, at 540, I will quote the relevant passage,  
     
      
      “It is one thing to deny that a necessary ingredient of the offence is positive knowledge of the fact that the driver holds no subsisting licence. It is another to say that an honest belief founded upon reasonable grounds that he is licensed cannot exculpate a person who permits that other one to drive.”. 
       
      
    This was a case of someone else driving this lady’s vehicle, she said she believed he had a licence. 
     
      
      As a general rule 
      ”(my emphasis) an honest and reasonable belief in a state of facts which, if they exist, would make a defendant’s act innocent affords an excuse for doing what would otherwise be an offence. 
       
       
      The strength of the presumption that the rule applies to a statutory offence newly created varies with the nature of the offence and the scope of the statute. If the purpose of the statute is to add a new crime to the general criminal law, it is natural to suppose that it is to be read subject to the general principles according to which that law is administered. But other considerations arise wherein matters of police, of health, of safety or the like the legislation adopts penal measures in order to cast on the individual the responsibility of so conducting his affairs that the general welfare will not be prejudiced. In such cases there is less ground either in reason or in actual probability for presuming an intention that the general rule should apply making honest and reasonable mistake a ground of exoneration, the presumption is but a weak one.”. 
       
       
      
    28. This case concerns driving. The driving regulations are predicated in part upon road safety. The presumption that the defence will apply is weak. The presumption of it being a reasonable excuse is weak. At the end of the day even accepting the magistrate’s acknowledgment of the evidence given by the appellant, in my view it is not one that is reasonable and the presumption, that it will apply is far too weak to take advantage of. I find that offence proved also.

     JUDGMENT 
    1. Michelle McEvoy appeals against the sentence imposed by Magistrate Brown, I think it was at the Blacktown Local Court, on 14 August last. On that occasion she had pleaded guilty to drive with intent to menace. He had the offence occurring on 1 November 2008. The learned magistrate imprisoned her for eight months with a non-parole period of four months. She was disqualified for a period of three years from 14 August to expire on 13 August.2. The background to the offence would appear to be available from the evidence of Belinda Hill, a neighbour, who gives evidence of having observed the appellant with the victim, one Russell Owen. Russell Owen is on her evidence a fifty nine year old married man with children with that partner and has been in some type of liaison with Michelle McEvoy to the extent that the appellant describes him to police as an ex partner. They have one four year old child, Liam McEvoy. The couple are not living together but she, as I understand it, is living in a house owned by the victim and paying rent to him.3. From the evidence of Ms Hill there are tensions that exist between the parties, and from Ms Hill’s perspective, the offending party to the point of stalking and intimidating in a substantial and serious way the victim Russell Owen. At about 3.30pm on Saturday 1 November 2008 Russell Owen was driving along Sorrento Drive, Glenwood in his silver Holden Commodore as he approached a roundabout. At the intersection of Sorrento Drive with Glenwood Park Drive he saw the appellant in her vehicle enter the roundabout and accelerate towards him.4. He accelerated into the roundabout to avoid collision. He had to reverse out from the wrong side of the road back into the roundabout. That manoeuvre is something I am having difficulty understanding but the appellant was said to have followed him along Glenwood Park Drive for a kilometre. He saw her following close behind. He did two loops of a roundabout at another intersection, Glenwood Park Drive and Malvern Road in an attempt, he said, to slow her down so that he could escape. He then travelled along Malvern Road at ninety kilometres an hour, further attempting to lose her.5. He saw the appellant drive on to the wrong side of the road next to his vehicle, I am assuming in Malvern Road. She steered her vehicle at his, causing both vehicles to collide. His vehicle sustained scrape marks to the off-side portion of a metre and a half in length and two and a bit inches in diameter. His vehicle mounted the gutter. The appellant pulled up in front of him and then reversed into his vehicle, colliding. In her vehicle was her son.6. Now, there were two other offences the magistrate dealt with and they are not, it would seem, the subject of appeal. 7. There is evidence before me that the victim, Owen, wanted to withdraw his statement as late as last week, 7 September 2009. What has caused him to do this is not revealed other than perhaps in a sentence “IF I WAS TO KNOW THIS WOULD LEAD TO THIS CONVICTION AND THIS OUTRAGEOUS SENTENCE then I would not have made it or withdrawn the statement”.8. The first attempt at withdrawing his statement would appear to be 1 December 2008. Mr Owen does not seem to be possessed with a very deep knowledge of the mechanisms of the criminal justice system. He says, 
     
      
      “Please consider and let it be known that I, Russell Owen, wish and request that the department of Police ceases to act on my behalf and hereby withdraws its case against the defendant.” 
       
       
      
    9. The police do not act on behalf of anybody. The police are there to enforce the peace, order and good government of the State of New South Wales. If people disobey the laws, the police have a sworn duty and obligation, to prosecute them.10. Further, if there is material which is appropriate to go before a court of law, whether it be the Local Court or this court, that court has a sworn duty to administer justice according to the law without fear or favour. It is not for victims or others to indicate to the court and expect some compliance with their so called indication that people are not to be prosecuted. If people have breached the law then both the police have a sworn duty to prosecute and judges have a sworn duty to administer justice according to the law.11. It is a fact that the court can take into account, if it thought for a moment it was appropriate so to do, that Russell did not seek to have the appellant incarcerated and had forgiven the appellant of the offence. But in terms of forgiving the appellant of the offence, nothing like that appears in his angry communications. I can not be satisfied, particularly in the light of the evidence I have heard, that it is not some mechanism for manipulating or holding it over, that is the withdrawal of the charge, over the appellant for some other ulterior purpose.12. The appellant has offences going back to Children’s Court days, 1998. She is born in 82 and would now be twenty seven years of age. As an adult she has offences of destroy or damage property, possessing prohibited drugs, a drive while under the influence of alcohol or other drug in April of 2008. On that occasion the learned magistrate gave her a s 10A conviction, no other penalty, and a twelve month disqualification. In those circumstances it must be seen that the magistrate took a fairly lenient view of that driving.13. The Crown in my view makes four significant points in respect of the criminality that is involved in this offence. The Crown described it as a high-end offence. It may not be as high as high end, but it certainly may well fall into a phrase that has become more frequent in criminal jargon, a mid-range offence, because the driver was unlicensed; there was a child in the car that was necessarily put in danger by this course of driving; there was a pursuit of the victim; and having as it were, damaged his vehicle that was not enough, she then had to reverse into him for an additional effect.14. The learned magistrate as I say imposed eight months’ imprisonment. What is significant, at least so far as I can see, is that the appellant has perhaps since this offence done all she can to rehabilitate at least from cannabis. She was a monumental abuser of cannabis, for some years smoking twenty to fifty cones daily.15. Cannabis at that level may well be thought by those smoking it to be relaxing them and putting them in a state of euphoria. But there can be no doubt that like many other drugs it has a collective effect, each time working and gathering strength adverse particularly to mental health issues. Paranoia and aggression are two things that flow from cannabis abuse. I note that the hospital records describe her two or three days later as being paranoid. One could not help but come to the view that that driving was aggressive.16. Continued abuse of cannabis would see those paranoia, aggression and other incidental mental health issues exacerbate. The appellant was wise to give it up. The other thing that is clearly obvious is that the appellant is severely depressed. Not so much this morning but particularly this afternoon she has sat behind her counsel weeping and crying hysterically. That may be a reactive depression, she may not want to go into custody. It may also be a more deep-seated proposition. It does not appear to me that anybody has addressed that issue in terms of her treatment to date. I may be wrong on that.HIS HONOUR: She’s not on any anti-depressant, I get these things all telescoped.CASHMAN: She’s on Zyprexa and Lexapro.HIS HONOUR: Yes, I did read something, to help her get off the cannabis. Now, where did I read that?CASHMAN: Lexapro’s an anti-depressant. She’s on 10 mls of Lexapro, your Honour, and that’s for her depression, that’s for the withdrawal - is that Lexapro?17. Yes, it has got “Since the breakdown of a long-term relationship a year ago she has been suffering depression and takes Lexapro for this condition. She further explains that she has been prescribed medication, Zyprexa, which is said to assist cannabis withdrawal.” I knew I had read that somewhere, thank you.18. But for what appears to me to be a fair dinkum effort of dealing with her cannabis problem, the sentence would have stood. But clearly there are some issues that need to be addressed before I can finalise this matter. I intend to review her in three months’ time, six months’ time, and in eight months’ time I will finalise this matter.19 In the meantime, pursuant to s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act she is to be placed on bail. Her bail conditions are these; that she is to be of good behaviour; she is to accept supervision by Probation and Parole; she is to obey all reasonable directions of Probation and Parole including treatment, counselling and programs as suggested by them; she is to abstain from all illicit drug use; she is to submit from random urine analysis from time to time as determined by Probation and Parole for the purpose of assessing whether she is using illicit drugs. Any dirty urine, any substituted urine will be deemed a breach of this bail and I will need to be notified forthwith.20. She is to abstain from all alcohol during the bail period; alcohol is a depressant and it is contraindicated if anybody is on antidepressants; and again to submit to any testing required of her by Probation and Parole randomly or otherwise for the purpose of ascertaining abstention from alcohol. She is to do all she can to obtain counselling with Westmead Hospital; she is to take her medication as prescribed. Any failure to take medication as prescribed will be deemed a breach of the bail.21. I am particularly interested in any psychiatric or psychological report that can be made available to me in three months’ time because I am satisfied there are serious mental health issues and particularly depression and probably anxiety. Failure to attend Probation and Parole counselling, training and meetings will be deemed a breach of bail. She should also continue to do what she can to maintain employment, that can be another condition of the bail. If she loses employment she will seek assistance with a Commonwealth employment agency and enrol in a personal assistance support program with them.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: David Francis Marshall appears for sentence today after having pleaded guilty at a very early stage to a large number of offences, dealing with both child pornography and firearms. When I sentence him for one of the firearms matters, he asks that I take into account a large number of other firearms matters on a Form 1. In total there are following offences which Mr Marshall is to be sentenced; an offence of using a carriage service to access child pornography material for which the maximum penalty is ten years imprisonment; an offence of using a carriage service to transmit child pornography material, also carrying a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment; an offence of using carriage service to make child pornography material available, an offence carrying with it a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment. They are all Commonwealth offences. There is also a State offence, possession of child pornography, carrying, at the time this offence was committed, a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment although the penalty has increased of more recent times. Of course it is the maximum penalty at the time the offence was committed which is relevant. And finally five offences under s.7A of the Firearms Act, unauthorised possession of a firearm. It is one of those, the offence relating to a twelve gauge shotgun, which has attached to it seventeen other offences relating to possession, improper storage and the possession of ammunition.2 This is an unusual case because the offender is an unusual man. The matters came to the attention of the authorities in mid-2008. They discovered that child pornography was being uploaded onto an internet site. Investigations revealed that an account subscribed to by the offender appeared to be responsible for the uploading of the child pornography images. So it came to be that on 11 February 2009 police went to the premises where the offender lived with his wife and one of his four children. He was cautioned and asked whether there was any child pornography on the premises, the offender said there was. He was also asked whether there were any firearms on the premises and the offender replied affirmatively to that question as well. A search then revealed child pornography images located in various areas, two lap tops, two personal computers, two hard drives and one USB drive; firearms and ammunition were found as well. The offender told police that he chatted on line with people who would describe sexual conduct with their children, doing this for fantasy. He said that he had downloaded child pornography, that he knew that the possession of child pornography was illegal, that the firearms were his and he knew he was supposed to have a licence to keep them. He told police also that he knew that he was supposed to keep those firearms secured. In other words the offender admitted, as soon as he was confronted by police, that he had committed all of the offences for which he is to be sentenced. Various hard drives and personal computers were later examined. There were a total of seven hard drives seized from the offender’s premises and each was found to contain child pornography on it. Technical investigation revealed that the child pornography images had been accessed via the internet. The total number of child pornography images found on the hard drives was more than four thousand, the vast majority consisting of the less serious forms of child pornography. Using the scale developed in the English guideline judgement of R v Oliver, Hartley and Baldwin1 [2003] Cr App R 28, most of the images were at level 1, consisting of erotic posing. However, there were other more serious examples of child pornography discovered, some even at level 5, which consists of sadism and bestiality. The offender maintains that he had not been able to view the level 5 video but no similar suggestion was made in relation to the photographs and videos of levels 2, 3 and 4. Thus the offender’s collection included a video of a girl aged approximately three years performing oral sex on an adult male who ejaculates into her mouth. 3 The forensic investigations revealed that child pornography material was accessed between the period of 1 March 2005 and 20 January 2009. That was, as is obvious, a considerable period of time and the last occasion on which child pornography material was accessed was only very shortly before police arrested the offender. During that period 3,682 images and nine videos were accessed. That of course relates to the first offence, the one of using a carriage service to access child pornography material. 4 The next offence of using a carriage service to transmit child pornography material, relates to chat logs discovered on the offender’s hard drive. Those logs were made available to me and I read the on-line conversation between the offender and anonymous people who are purported to be overseas. In that material the offender discusses disgusting and disturbing sexual acts involving children. He not only describes and asks to have described to him sexual acts involving children but tells the people to whom he is conversing what he would like to do to children and what he enjoys. It is to be noted that there is no real evidence that the offender ever intended to carry out these desires, nor is there any evidence that these chat logs involved any direct harm to any human being. They appear to have been, as the offender told police on the day of his arrest, fantasy. I should at this stage refer to one particular aspect of the chat logs. On one occasion the person to whom the offender is chatting tells the offender that he has been molesting his daughter and invites the offender to communicate on the computer with that daughter. There is no evidence for me to decide whether this was the product of a perverted mind or whether there really was a young girl who was being molested involved. I will sentence the offender on the basis that I cannot be satisfied that there was a real human being harmed at any time through the offender’s chats on line.5 The next offence concerns the offender making child pornography available. The evidence revealed that the offender had uploaded files and made available twenty-four images, all in the latter part of 2007. As is clear, there is a substantial overlap between these four offences involving child pornography, for example the offence of possessing child pornography, a State offence, relate to child pornography material that had been accessed using a carriage service and the pornographic images made available by the offender appear also to have first come into his possession when he used a carriage service to access them. I bear that substantial overlap in mind when I sentence the offender. 6 We now move to offences of a different kind, they are firearm offences, all relating to the offender’s possession of firearms and ammunition. The offender was in possession of a large number of firearms set out in both the indictment and the Form 1. Some were inoperable, for example one did not have a bolt or trigger, and another one was bent, according to the offender, but others were very capable of being fired and in many cases suitable ammunition was possessed by the offender as well. As is clear from the offences to which the offender has admitted his guilt, they were not properly secured either, being kept either under his bed or in a cupboard. Some weapons appear to have been almost antiques, others are of more recent times. There was no challenge to the offender’s evidence that he had last fired them on his honeymoon, some considerable time ago. 7 These offences are very serious matters indeed. It is not for me to speak at length about the gravity of child pornography matters, I have done so on other occasions as have courts throughout the world. I will content myself with saying however, that offences such as those involving child pornography, apart of course from the one involving chat logs, all involve significant harm to young people, to children, not only when they are directly photographed or videoed, being forced to perform sexual acts as they pose for the camera, but also because of the wider implications involving the sexualisation of children generally. It is disturbing indeed to realise that there are many people in the community who obtain sexual gratification through watching images and videos of the type described here. The thought that a human being with an ounce of compassion could watch and then keep possession of a video involving a three year old girl having a man ejaculate in her mouth is difficult to understand. The offender says he did not do it for sexual gratification, but simply because he was curious. I will return to that question later.8 The offender is now sixty-one years of age. He is married with four children. He has in his past much of which he is entitled to be proud, for example he was for many years a volunteer with the bushfire service and as part of that voluntary work he was awarded medals and commendations. He served in the army reserve and he was also acknowledged for his service in that regard. He was employed with the Rural Fire Service until early this year when he retired. There is nothing to suggest any other criminal activity apart from those that I have described. On the other hand it has to be recognised that there is a multiplicity of offending, even if it only relates to aspects of the offender’s misconduct and that the offending occurred over a significant period of time. 9 The offender has a substantial bank of good character on which he is entitled to rely when I sentence him for these matters. 10 I note that the offender pleaded guilty to these matters at an early stage. There was an indictment presented today for technical reasons, but the early pleas mean that I should discount the sentence I would impose for the Commonwealth matters by twenty-five percent to recognise the offender’s assistance in the administration of justice and by twenty-five percent in the State matters, to recognise the utilitarian value of his pleas.11 At around the time that he began committing these offences the offender was suffering from depression, part of that followed the death of his parents and the recognition of his mortality. He has also suffered from what has been suggested in the various reports, to be Asperger’s syndrome. Related to that is his diagnosis of OCD, obsessive, compulsion disorder, which manifests itself in various ways including most relevantly to these offences, in collecting and hoarding things such as model tanks, coins and possibly firearms and child pornography. Physically the offender is not well either, suffering from hypertension and diabetes and having been treated in 2005 for heart disease. 12 Those physical and mental conditions of course have multiple relevance. Obviously they will make his time in custody harder than would otherwise be the case. The fact that he was suffering from depression and OCD at the time of this offending means that his moral culpability is lower than it would otherwise have been although not significantly so, given the clear nature of the offender’s recognition the wrongfulness of his misconduct. It also of course means that general deterrence plays less of a part than it would otherwise. That of course is not to say that general deterrence is to be ignored. Despite the matters that I have referred to, it remains as an important aspect in the sentence to be imposed upon this offender. 13 Some time was spent today, including having evidence called, regarding what motivated the offender. For example he has at times said that he began to download child pornography because he was curious. That is somewhat inconsistent with what he has said at other times, including that he found full frontal girls attractive, something he said to Mr Borenstein, psychologist, and it scarcely explains the ongoing nature of the offender’s wrongdoing. One might have thought that for a person to commence in March 2005, looking at child pornography out of curiosity that curiosity might have been well satisfied by late January 2009. So I do not accept for one moment really that the offender’s motivation in downloading, looking at and making available child pornography was mere curiosity, but even if I am wrong, what does it matter? People who produce child pornography, abusing children in a most violent, disgusting way as they do so, do not care if the motivation of someone accessing that material is curiosity or gratification. Certainly the child who is harmed through the production of that material does not care one way or the other. All the child knows is that he or she has been harmed. 14 Another aspect in dispute concerned the nature of what motivated the offender to chat to others, those chats being count 2 on the indictment. The offender said that he was doing so to catch or trap child abusers and child pornographers. He recognised of course that he had no training to do so but maintained that that was why he was doing it. He recognised also that he had never done anything to draw to the attention of police in Australia, or overseas for that matter, to what he was doing and what he had found. The nature of the chats themselves does not suggest that the offender was trying to catch others. It is often the case that whilst chatting to someone about nudism the offender introduces subtly at first of course, sexual topics involving children, progressing to the stage where he speaks in a disgusting manner about what he would like to do and what he has seen and what he has done. Ordinarily it would be easy to dismiss the offender’s claim as to what motivated him to chat. As I mentioned this is not an ordinary case because the offender is an unusual man. I have therefore made allowances in the offender’s favour, but despite that, I remain of the view that the offender was not chatting in a disgusting way to trap people, but was doing it for his own pleasure. I take into account in particular that there is not the slightest hint in any of the chats put before me to suggest that the offender made any inquiry at all of any kind in an effort to obtain information which could be used to identify the person to whom he was chatting. And nor did he obtain the forensic computer assistance with the police at anytime despite his career being related to IT. I should also mention at this stage that there is no evidence that the offender sold any material or profited in a monetary term through making available the images which he did make available in late 2007. The evidence suggests that he swapped material which benefited him in some way. 15 It is easy of course when confronted with a person who has committed both child pornography and firearm offences to focus on the child pornography offence, they are more capable of creating an emotional response, something of course a judge must avoid, but the firearms offences are of course serious in their own way. There is no evidence that the offender was going to use these firearms to commit a further crime but given the way they were stored, given the number of them, given the fact that there was ammunition suitable for a number of the firearms stored in a dangerous way as well, the risk of both accident and the firearms falling into the wrong hands was significant. The offender seemed to regard it as important that the firearms not be destroyed. Even he recognised that one option available to him would be to donate the firearms to a museum or RSL Club for example. Of course as I mentioned earlier, the offender’s OCD probably had a fair bit to do with his decision to retain possession of the firearms despite him knowing that he should not have.16 The offender has expressed his remorse and I accept that as genuine. He said that at the time he committed these offences he was in effect leading two different lives. He now appears to be relieved in one sense that he is able to put these offences behind him. The offender’s remorse, again early, not only through immediate admissions to police on the day they came to his home but also through assisting them with the provision of passwords and the like as they investigated both his wrongdoing and also attempted to discover the identity of others over the internet. I am reminded of course that some of the offences can be dealt with summarily although many others cannot, but I do take into account, as the law requires me to, that some of the offences could have been dealt with in the Local Court. I have to say that I am not quite sure why that is a matter which would benefit an offender. He has after all committed offences which are so serious that it is appropriate that they be dealt with in this Court. The law is otherwise, and I will follow the law and do what the appellate courts tell me I must. 17 Mr Hartcher helpfully summarises also some matters which reduce the seriousness of the child pornography offences, below that which is commonly before the Court. Some I mentioned and some I did not. I will take into account, as Mr Hartcher asked me to, that the vast majority of the imagines fall within the lowest category of child pornography offences, and in comparison to many other offenders who come before the court, the offender possessed a relatively small number of images and videos. He was not motivated by profit, he did not produce any of the child pornography, apart of course from the conversations which I said were fantasy over the chat box.18 There is no evidence that the offender was part of some ring of child pornographers; no evidence that apart from the number of images he made available, he shared the material with anyone, disclosed to people, especially vulnerable people. 19 I turn now to the question of special circumstances regarding the State offences, as I will impose fixed terms on those matters, it is not necessary for me to consider that matter further. The ratio of the non-parole period to head sentence to Commonwealth offences used to be thought of as being a norm of sixty to sixty-six percent, the High Court has recently disabused judges of the notion, that is a norm as previously understood. As it turns out however the ratio of non-parole period to overall head sentence in this case will be sixty per cent. It enables an adequate period for the offender to be on parole so that he can be supervised in the community in order to ensure that offences such as these cannot be repeated.20 The offender is sentenced as follows:21 For counts 5, 6, 8 and 9 a fixed term of imprisonment of twelve months to date from 20 October 2010. 22 Count 7 a fixed term of eighteen months imprisonment to date from 20 October 2010. 23 Counts 2 and 3 a fixed term of imprisonment of twelve months to date from 20 April 2011.24 Counts 1 and 4 a non parole period of twelve months to date from 20 October 2012 with a head sentence of three years, that means that the overall sentence which consists of a non parole period of three years, head sentence of five years when the offender is eligible to be released to parole on 19 October 2013.NB: The sentences for counts 2 and 3 were later amended to commence on 20 October 2011, but this did not effect the overall term

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Most cases that come before the criminal courts are sad cases but this case is sadder than most. For reasons that I will speak about later, after a lengthy period of a law abiding lifestyle the offender sunk to a level where she began using drugs once again, committed serious offences, and then ultimately reached the stage where the only way she could see that she could get help was to deliberately commit an offence so that she could go to gaol. That really does indicate the depths to which Ms Middlemiss had sunk.2 She began using drugs again in 2008. She had been friends for many years with a Maree Collier. Ms Collier was a high level drug dealer. An indication of the scale of her drug dealing can be gleaned from the fact that when she was sentenced by Judge Black for her various drug dealing activities she received a non-parole period of fifteen years. 3 On 9 July 2008 Ms Middlemiss agreed to assist Ms Collier in one particular transaction. Ms Collier had agreed with an undercover police officer, although no-one knew of course that that is who he was, to supply him with one ounce of heroin for $9,400. Ms Middlemiss at the request of her friend therefore went to a prearranged location, handed over the ounce of drugs and received $9,400. For that Ms Middlemiss received no money. She was paid for her part in drugs. 4 I should mention at this stage that Ms Middlemiss required the assistance of a Ms Powell. I earlier sentenced Ms Powell for her involvement in this offence. Ms Powell’s involvement was minor indeed and an indication of that can be seen in the sentence that I imposed upon her of 300 hours community service. Neither the circumstances of Ms Collier nor the circumstances of Ms Powell will provide much of a guide as to the sentence I should impose upon Ms Middlemiss because of their vastly different circumstances to hers.5 About a month later on 8 August Ms Middlemiss became involved in another drug transaction involving Ms Collier. On this occasion the deal was for three ounces of heroin for $27,000. Ms Middlemiss’s role was again to drive to the location, this time with Ms Collier herself and the drugs and to mind the drugs while Ms Collier and the undercover officer concluded their business.6 Ms Middlemiss was arrested for these matters and placed on unconditional bail. The next two offences that I will describe were therefore committed whilst she was on bail. 7 On 4 October 2009 Ms Middlemiss was under the influence of both illegal drugs and Xanax. She has no memory of what she did but of course accepts that what I’m about to describe is accurate. The offence I am about to describe is terrifying. A young lady was working within a store known as The Big Swim. As its name might indicate it sells swimming costumes. It was not a bank, it was not a building society, it was not a chemist. It was not any sort of retail premises where there was likely to be a huge amount for the taking. It was a soft target. The young lady who worked in the store worked there alone.8 The offender came in and discussed swimming costumes with her. She then left and came back. At this time there was another customer in the store. Ms Middlemiss waited till that customer left and then began attacking the shopkeeper with a hammer. This attack came without warning. The shopkeeper had her back to the offender as the attack commenced. 9 Ms Middlemiss hit the shopkeeper about ten times to the head and continued to hit her even after the victim had fallen to the ground. Still images taken from CCTV footage were tendered by the Crown. In those the shopkeeper is seen on her hands and knees while Ms Middlemiss bends over her with the hammer. 10 Fortunately the victim managed to get hold of the hammer as a struggle ensued. Eventually they came to some sort of agreement that the offender would take the cash and leave. She was able to get $425 from the cash register and go away.11 It is somewhat remarkable that the injuries suffered by the victim were as limited as they were. Despite being attacked by a person wielding a full size hammer and despite being struck by that hammer ten times she very fortunately did not suffer any fractures to her skull. Apart from some bruising, the wounding, being an element of the offence, consisted of one or two lacerations, quite small indeed. I say one or two because of the inconsistencies in the medical evidence as to how many there were.12 We now come to the offence of 23 October. As well as being on bail, this offence was committed whilst the offender was on a s 9 bond for a PCA matter. On this day Ms Middlemiss went to Maroubra Police Station. She told them she wished to confess to a malicious damage offence so that she could go to gaol. The police made inquiries but could not identify any offence of malicious damage that the offender could have committed. It is part of the sadness of this case that the offender could not remember having committed that most serious offence of armed robbery with wounding which I have just described. She was unable to convince the police that she had committed a malicious damage offence and so she left saying “Okay you’ll see”. 13 What was in Ms Middlemiss’s mind was that she had to commit a further offence so that she could go back to gaol. It was part of the depth to which she had sunk but that was the only way she knew that she could achieve a measure of rehabilitation, the only way she knew that she could get support which was likely to work to assist her with her drug addiction.14 She therefore went home, got a syringe and filled it with red cordial. She then entered a shop, relatively close to the swimwear shop, and approached the employee. She produced the syringe and said, “I have a needle, I am a drug addict, I have AIDS and I will stab you if you don’t open the till”. Despite saying those threatening words Ms Middlemiss continued to apologise to the victim saying that she was only committing the offence so that she could return to gaol. Not surprisingly the victim feared that he would be assaulted. He opened the cash register and money was taken.15 Police attended a short time later. It did not take them long before they realised what had happened. They went to the offender’s home. She answered the door and said “I’ve been waiting for you guys” and made admissions to the offence she had recently committed. She had been preparing for this eventuality, selling her furniture, arranging for someone to care for her dogs and even going to the extent of emptying water out of her water bed. She knew that she would not be coming home for some time.16 Ms Middlemiss is now forty-five years old. She was brought up in Sydney. She went to school in Glebe and did well there for a while but she was expelled at the age of fifteen. She could not remember when she spoke to a doctor from Justice Health why that was. She then got into a relationship with a man who sold heroin when she was about eighteen and she began experimenting with drugs. She started taking heroin, needed to commit offences to buy the drugs, got caught and went to gaol.17 However things improved in 1991. It was then that her son was born. She stopped using heroin when she was pregnant and did well, using no further street drugs and only drinking socially for many years. Even when that relationship with her son’s father ceased she did not relapse into drug use. She had a relationship with Ms Collier which ended and then she began a relationship with a man by the name of Wayne. It was the break-up of the relationship with Wayne which heralded the change in Ms Middlemiss’s life.18 The circumstances of the break-up were particularly painful. Wayne wanted a child. Ms Middlemiss did not fall pregnant, and so he therefore left her. At around the same time she suffered other losses. Her nephew committed suicide and a close friend died. That led to Ms Middlemiss’s use and abuse of drugs and alcohol and even a serious suicide attempt. She attempted rehabilitation from time to time but did not stay. 19 So having been offence free since 1991, after the downward spiral I have mentioned she has now committed four very serious offences. She has been in custody since 25 October 2009. 20 In gaol she is doing well. She has studied and received appropriate certificates and is a trusted prisoner. She has, it would seem, achieved the rehabilitation that she desired and she was right to think that the best thing that could have happened to her was to go to gaol. It is unfortunate in the extreme of course that she could only do that by committing offences.21 She hopes to continue with her rehabilitation after sentence today, it being part of Corrective Services’ policy that many courses and rehabilitative programs are not available to unsentenced prisoners.22 She is genuinely remorseful, particularly for the offence she committed upon the young woman in the swimwear store. Having no memory of it she was horrified when she learnt what she had done. She said that it was no part of her makeup to commit offences of violence. I accept that at the time of that offence she was under the influence of drugs which caused her to act out of character.23 Ms Middlemiss is also sorry for the other offences she has committed as well, recognising that the effects upon the victims of those offences are serious. Consistent with those expressions of remorse she pleaded guilty at an early opportunity to these four offences and so the sentence I impose upon her will be twenty-five less than it would otherwise have been.24 Let me say something now about the offence of armed robbery and wounding. That is an offence which as well as carrying a maximum penalty of twenty-five years has a standard non parole period of seven years. Of course that standard non parole period is not of direct application because of the plea of guilty but it remains an important guidepost to the sentence that I should impose. It is also important, and indeed it is required, that I assess the objective gravity of that offence in a way that I would not be required to do if the offence did not carry a standard non-parole period.25 I consider that it is slightly below the middle of the range of objective seriousness of offences of that type. It was a sustained attack with multiple injuries. On the other hand those injuries were less serious than is commonly the case in offences involving wounding, being one or two small lacerations. For those reasons I make the finding that whilst obviously serious objectively it is as I have said slightly below the middle of the range of objective seriousness. 26 The are reasons therefore that I will not apply the standard non-parole period. The plea of guilty, the fact that the offence is slightly below the mid range, the other mitigating circumstances that I referred to and finally a more technical matter involving the need to give effect to my finding of special circumstances by enlarging the eligibility for parole at the expense of the non-parole period.27 Having recently had one of my sentences described in the Court of Criminal Appeal as unusual I will explain for the benefit of those who will read these remarks, the approach that I have taken to the sentence of count 3, that is the armed robbery whilst wounding. The non-parole period is longer than the period of eligibility for parole because the Court of Criminal Appeal authority has for many years emphasised that where sentences are accumulated, mathematically, if the sentences have a non-parole period of three-quarters of the head sentence then the overall non parole period is much more than three-quarters of the overall head sentence. For that reason it is necessary, particularly for the last sentence imposed in a series to have a relatively short non-parole period. That is why the sentence for the armed robbery with wounding matter which comes at the end of my sentences has a ratio of non-parole period to head sentence which, looking at it alone, might be thought by the Court of Criminal Appeal at least, to be unusual.28 I mentioned special circumstances. There are special circumstances in this case as Ms Middlemiss has shown she is capable of leading a law abiding lifestyle and with the assistance of the Probation and Parole Service upon her release from custody I am confident that she will do that once again. It is in her interests and it is in the community’s interest that she be given assistance upon her release from custody to maximise the chance that she will do what I think she is capable of doing, that is living a life that does not involve criminality.29 Nevertheless it has to be recognised that these were serious offences. Ms Middlemiss was, as Mr Goold conceded, trafficking to a substantial degree when she was involved in the drug matters and committed a most serious offence on 4 October 2009. She must therefore go to gaol for a significant period of time. 30 The sentences I impose are as follows. For both drug offences, that is the offence of knowingly taking part in the supply of heroin on 8 August 2008 and the offence of supplying heroin on 9 July 2008 the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a fixed term of two years to date from 25 October 2009. Those sentences of course to be served concurrently.31 For the offence of armed robbery, that is the offence committed on 25 October 2009 the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a fixed term of two years to date from 25 October 2010. Those three sentences are fixed terms because of the sentence I will now impose on the remaining matter.32 For the offence of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon causing wounding committed on 4 October 2009 the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of eighteen months to date from 25 October 2011 and a head sentence of four and a half years. Thus the overall effective sentence is a non-parole period of three and a half years with a head sentence of six and a half years and Ms Middlemiss is entitled to be released to parole on 24 April 2013.

   JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: Michael Mifsud pleaded guilty to two offences, one of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and one of receiving. The maximum penalties for those offences are seven years and ten years respectively. 2 He had earlier been convicted of a more serious offence after pleading not guilty to that offence at trial. He was sentenced for the offence of robbery in company in June last year but that conviction was overturned and a new trial ordered in December last year. He was granted bail and now appears for sentence after having pleaded guilty to less serious offences today.3 Mr Flood asks that I finalise the matter today on the basis that effectively the offender has served the non-parole period that I would have imposed for these two offences. He has spent nine months and seventeen days in custody plus some time in quasi custody in residential rehabilitation programs, one month at Foundation House and fourteen months at WHOS. Mr Flood’s submission is that, given the objective circumstances of the offence and his client’s efforts at rehabilitation of recent times, any sentence I would impose upon his client would not involve him going back into custody but would effectively see him being placed on a period of parole, Mr Flood says, for ten months. The Crown, on the other hand, I gather, says that there should be a further period of custody imposed today. I am going to do neither what the Crown wants nor what Mr Flood wants.4 The offence arose when the offender, who had been drinking and who, until recent times, used to drink a whole lot went with two of his friends to the home of the complainant. The complainant recognised the offender but not the two friends. At one point the complainant asked everyone to leave. Instead of doing so what happened was that the complainant was subject to violence at the hands of all three of the other men there.5 The offender grabbed the complainant on his testicles and told one of his friends to smack the complainant on his head. He called his two friends his soldiers. The complainant told them that he had a heart condition and he had had a couple of heart attacks that year. This apparently caused no feelings of compassion or mercy on the part of the three other men because one of them punched the complainant in the head causing him to fall off his chair. The complainant retreated, going to his bedroom but the offender and his two friends followed him into the bedroom and commenced hitting him. This offender was actually at one stage holding he complainant down so that he could not get up off the bed. He told his friends that they should give the complainant a good whack. At one point he slipped off the bed onto the floor where he was kicked while he was lying defenceless on the ground. One of the men, not this offender, said that “we should cut his throat”. Eventually the three men left and the complainant noticed that his wallet was missing. Police came upon the three men later after having been called by the complainant. When they searched the three men they found the complainant’s wallet in the possession of the offender.6 Because of the pleas of guilty to charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company and receiving, rather than pleas of guilty to robbery in company, in order for me not to breach the rule in R v De Simone(1981) 147 CLR 383 I will sentence the offender on the basis that what really happened is that one of the offenders took the complainant’s wallet without the complainant’s knowledge and without the offender’s knowledge and that this wallet was given to the offender by one of the other men in the period between when they left the complainant’s premises and when the police arrested them.7 One of the most important circumstances regarding the offender’s background is his excessive use of alcohol. He was drinking large quantities of whisky every day with no periods of abstinence at all. He was also smoking cannabis regularly. He has a criminal history, including offences of stealing from a person and conspiring to commit an armed robbery and thirty counts of armed robbery. These of course are very serious offences, but they occurred some time ago in 1993 when the offender was a much younger man than he is today.8 In early August this year, that is not too long ago, the offender entered into a program run by the construction industry, (whether that be the union or employers), called Foundation House. It is a program with which I was not familiar, but apparently it involves one month of residence with counselling, group sessions, exercises, education as well as chores. The offender appears to have successfully completed that program. The offender was also seen by psychiatrists after completion of the program. The psychiatrist recommends, amongst other things, that the offender should be referred to a psychiatrist for treatment.9 I note that this offence occurred on 23 June 2008. For some part of the time since then the offender has not been at large but he has not, whilst he has been in the community, committed any other offence. He says now that he has not had a drink for some time and wants to continue attending AA meetings and counselling and is prepared to go to a psychiatrist as Dr Allnutt recommends. We therefore have a situation where the offender is promising rehabilitation but has not yet demonstrated it. Whether he is able to rehabilitate himself and to demonstrate that rehabilitation has taken place is of considerable importance to the sentence that I will ultimately impose upon the offender. 10 I do not accept Mr Flood’s categorisation of the offence, as being in the middle of the range. It was a sustained attack during which the complainant was kicked whilst he was in his own home and it occurred after he had asked the offenders to leave. In my view, objectively, absent any demonstration of rehabilitation, a further period of custody is required. However, depending on what Mr Mifsud is able to demonstrate over the period between now and when I next see him, it may well be that I am able to focus my attention on his rehabilitation rather than his punishment. 11 That, of course, is not to say that I will ignore the objective circumstances of the offence at all. It is a fundamental rule in sentencing that the sentence must reflect the objective gravity of what the offender has done, which was not only to commit the offence of violence which I have described, but also to receive one of the products of that violence, namely the complainant’s wallet.12 Accordingly, in order that I can assess the offender’s capacity for further rehabilitation and allow him to demonstrate that rehabilitation has taken place I propose to defer passing sentence under s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I will grant bail to the offender for that purpose. That bail is granted subject to the following conditions and I put this as the first condition because of its importance. 
     
     The offender is to abstain completely from the consumption of alcohol or illegal drugs. 
     He is to attend AA meetings at least once per week. 
     He is to attend a counsellor at Foundation House once per week unless the counsellor recommends counselling sessions should be more frequent or less frequent. 
     He is to seek a referral to a psychiatrist and accept treatment from that psychiatrist for as often and for as long as he or she determines. 
     He is to accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service, including regular testing for the consumption of drugs and alcohol and he is to participate in any programs relating to education, anger management and the like as the Probation and Parole Service requires. 
    13 The matter is listed to come back before me on 24 June 2011. I will order a pre-sentence report for that day. I will order a transcript of the remarks that I have just delivered and should there be any problem with compliance with those bail conditions the matter is to be brought back before me for an application that the bail conditions be amended rather than Mr Mifsud simply ignoring them.14 Mr Mifsud would you mind standing up please. I suspect that Mr Flood has told you what I have just done or alerted you to the possibility that I might do what I have just done. I am not going to finally sentence you today. I will do that late June next year.15 If you come back to me having complied with the conditions of bail then it is most likely that you will not go back to gaol. If, on the other hand, you have breached the bail then it is almost a guarantee that you will go back to gaol, do you understand that?16 OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.17 HIS HONOUR: You might actually be worse off than if I dealt with you today because if you have demonstrated that despite your promises to rehabilitate yourself you are not able to do so, that is a pretty significant matter that I will take into account when I sentence you, you understand that. There is going to be times when you are tempted. I want you to think about this. Is it worth going to gaol for?18 OFFENDER: No.19 HIS HONOUR: Good. Just bear that in mind when that temptation comes because it is a pretty high price to pay for a drink, to end up back in gaol, you understand?20 OFFENDER: Yes I do. 21 ADJOURNED TO FRIDAY 24 JUNE 2011 FOR SENTENCE

   JUDGMENT1 Break, Enter and Steal is a crime most frequently committed against working men and women. It is also most frequently committed by men and women who do not work for wages.2 On Tuesday 28 February 2006 the residents of 17 Irribin Street headed off to work. The last to leave, the male occupant, was gone by 6:45am. At 1.15pm that day he was contacted by police telling him his house had been broken into. He returned to find the rear bedroom window smashed, clothes pulled from the cupboards and drawers, the TV cabinet raided and most of his house upended. Two mountain bikes, costing more than four thousand dollars, were taken. Twenty “Playstation” games and a “Discman” and other property were taken. 3 Christopher Ryan, then aged eighteen and a half, was one of the two persons who broke into and stole from these premises. Today he is to be held accountable for his involvement in this criminal conduct.Facts 4 Two males, including the offender, approached the front door of 17 Irribin Street, knocked on the door to ascertain that no-one was at home. The time was 11.45am. The door being unanswered, the two made their way to the rear of the premises, smashed the rear bedroom window and made their way inside. An alert neighbour notified the police. He also took a number of photographs of the offenders as they decamped from the crime scene. At about 12.05 police spotted both youths in nearby Doonside riding the stolen bikes. Shortly thereafter both youths were arrested. The prompt intervention of the neighbour resulted in the prompt arrest of each offender and, significantly, the recovery of all or most stolen property. It also sends a message to those two offenders, and hopefully others, that the community is not keen to tolerate those who prey upon the property of hardworking men and women.5 On 28 October 2006 Christopher Ryan was committed to this court for sentence. He has been bail refused since 28 February 2006. On 14 July last year, however, he was sentenced to imprisonment for six months. That was a fixed term for three “Break, Enter and Steal” offences charged against him in September and October of 2005. Those sentences expired on 13 January 2007.6 The co-offender in the offence with which I am dealing was dealt with in the Children’s Court. He received thirty hours community service for this offence.Objective Criminality7 I turn now to the objective criminality. The offence of breaking and entering is an offence against the property of persons. It differs from “Larceny” in that it also involves the entry into premises, usually through damaged to the property. Anyone in the position of this offender should stop and pause for a moment to understand the significance the law places upon the private homes of individuals.8 The offence of “Larceny”, standing on its own, carries a maximum penalty of five years. If you commit that larceny in somebody’s home by breaking and entering the maximum penalty almost triples, it becomes one of fourteen years. The law has always regarded the privacy of a person’s home as paramount. Police officers and others who want to go into people’s homes say, to search for things, need an order of the court so to do. The Court has always been assiduous in protecting people’s homes.9 The guideline judgment on breaking and entering lists a number of criteria that the Court should have regard to when sentencing for this offence. Against that criteria the following observations can be made - this offence was committed while this offender was on a probation order made by the Children’s Court. At the time of his offending he was on this probation order for offences of a similar kind. The offence was not spontaneous. I am satisfied the two youths went to the premises intending to break and enter provided no-one was home. Their arrival at the premises, knocking on the door, making their way to the rear of the house and smashing the window were all contemplated within their plan. The offender was accompanied by another youth. That has not been charged as a feature of aggravation. Had it been incorporated into the charge as, indeed, the prosecution would have been entitled to do, the maximum penalty for the offence would have increased to twenty years with a standard non-parole of five years. 10 Breaking and entering is regarded as offences of a serious nature and the legislature recently has told us that we, in this court, should be increasing the penalties we give for the offence. To get, in effect, four break and enters for an eleven months sentence is not going to happen anymore. 11 There is High Court authority that I cannot punish for an offence that the offender has not been charged with. He has not been charged with being in company. In those circumstances, I do not take into account this, otherwise, aggravating feature (see De Simoni v The Queen (1981) 147 CLR 383.Reference12 The bedrooms in the property were left in disarray. That state of disarray constitutes an aggravation of the criminality associated with the unlawful entry into the premises. Offenders should understand that people value not only the possessions in their home but the order in their home. When they come into their home and find everything in disarray it is as though they, personally, have been violated. Frequently, people who have had break and enters into their home ultimately end up having to move from their home because they cannot stand the thought of somebody having trampled all over their space.13 It is argued that this offence was towards the lower end of the range. Given the commission of the offence whilst on conditional liberty, the lack of spontaneity in determining to commit the offence, the disarray left behind and the value of items taken, the offence does not qualify as towards the lower end. However, it does not reach the mid-range of seriousness either. Objectively, it presents greater criminality than the lower end but less than a mid-range of criminality.Subjective features 14 Christopher Ryan is currently aged nineteen and a half. He is a single, indigenous man. Family social dynamics 15 He is reported to have had a difficult, unstable upbringing. His Godmother, Kim Downing, today has told the Court he probably was on the streets from the age of eleven. He has not met his biological father. His primary carers, through childhood and adolescence, have been his mother, his grandmother and Godparents. They have known him since he was six years old. He has been receiving support, whilst in custody, from his girlfriend and, it would seem, also by contact with his mother and Godmother. During his early years with his mother, his stepfather was daily abusing him physically and/or emotionally. By that I mean that both forms of abuse were occurring. This offender is of slight build. His mother was either unable or unwilling to intervene. The mother left her partner and lived with her own mother, the offender’s nan. However, he was asked to leave at the age of fifteen because he had been pawning her possessions, I have inferred for the purpose of buying drugs or alcohol. 16 For a while he moved among various acquaintances before seeking assistance from his Godparents. There he lived until his incarceration. How effective that can be, in part, can be assessed by noting his encounters with the criminal justice system commence in October 2004 when he was first charged with break and enter. Since that time there have been seven occasions when he has been charged with committing various offences of dishonesty and/or unlawful entry onto property. 17 The pre-sentence report author, Lisa Prince, tentatively expresses a view that the Godparents provide a more positive, structured and disciplined environment. Having heard from Kim Downing this morning I would agree with that assessment. The problem is that you can lead the horse to water, as they say, but you cannot make it drink. It is a matter of whether the offender is willing to commit to an arrangement where he has to surrender some of his liberties, as-it-were, for the benefit of the association. It is that factor that has caused me to pause before I finalise this matter, I want to see if it works.18 Living with the Downings, appears to me, to offer him a more inclusive life form or lifestyle. They have taken him fishing in the past and to car races and included him, it seems, within their family structure.19 On release, the offender says, he would be uncomfortable living with his mother, her new partner and his sister. I doubt that the level of support available there would be adequate to assist his rehabilitation efforts. I can indicate from my experience, that it is tough coming out of prison and settling into a new lifestyle. I do not anticipate it will be easy but you should be able to do it within the three months that I am allowing.20 The relationship with the girlfriend is one that has been on and off for a four year period. She is a regular consumer of cannabis. It is unlikely he would find a stable environment with her, although she has visited him regularly whilst he has been in custody. Withdrawing from drugs is difficult enough without having to share time and closeness with another person regularly committed to using drugs. Education, skills and employment 21 Christopher Ryan apparently did not enjoy school. He had lost interest in education by year 9. His behaviour at school was disruptive. He truanted often. He was suspended for smoking; whether that was cannabis or just cigarettes is unclear from the material. Ryan has no employment history he can rely on. His legitimate income stream to date appears to have come from Centrelink benefits. He says that he has worked with an uncle and done landscape gardening. If so, it was not regular work but rather itinerant, as best I can gather. He appears to recognise, however, the importance of employment as a means of leading a more productive lifestyle. In that, he is correct and, hopefully, he will gain self-confidence and self-image from employment, not to mention a better income stream.22 Those oversighting his rehabilitation should focus upon securing, for him, access to the personal support programs offered by the various agencies out there to assist him acquire skills, vocational training and access to employment. He has told the pre-sentence report author he is prepared to co-operate with the employment agencies. He has expressed an interest in car-detailing. It is the kind of work, as does landscape gardening, that offers job satisfaction and reasonable money. It is certainly within his ambit to provide the skills in either of those areas and full-time employment.Health 23 Christopher Ryan presents as a slight but compact young man. So far as one can tell, from physical appearance, he appears to be in good physical health.Mental Health 24 There is no psychological report before the Court. Nor is there any suggestion in the pre-sentence report that there are any mental health issues that have come to the attention of his custodians other than his drug and alcohol issues.Drug and Alcohol 25 Christopher Ryan has an entrenched cannabis problem. He commenced daily smoking of cannabis at the age of fourteen. At some point he was spending a hundred dollars daily on the drug. By sixteen he was also consuming copious quantities of alcohol - a carton of beer every two days. He was a binge drinker. During the period he has resided with his Godparents, there was some abatement of alcohol and cannabis consumption. I am satisfied, however, that it was by no means stifled. It just simply did not reach the height of gross access it had previously been at. Notwithstanding his evidence to the contrary, I am satisfied he has taken opportunities, whilst in custody, to smoke cannabis. Of course the level of consumption, in custody, is unlikely to have been anything like as heavy as he previously reached. The significance is, though, he has not persuaded me he is clean of the drug. There have been three institutional charges. I am satisfied at least two of them reflect cannabis use. He claims to have enrolled in drug programs at John Moroney but was moved to Parramatta Correctional Centre and then to the MRRC. I have looked at his custodial record and he seems to have done a lot of moving around; so it is likely that he has been moved before he had an opportunity to attend the courses. I accept that movement within the prison system often disrupts attendance at programs. I am prepared to accept it did so in his case. Thus, he will be leaving custody without having had access to drug and alcohol counselling. The good news is he wanted to do it. Unfortunately, he did not get it done. It is important, therefore, he attend counselling whilst on the outside. I regard him at serious risk of abusing cannabis upon his release for these reasons -  
     
     Prior heavy history of cannabis use continued interest and participation in cannabis smoking whilst in custody 
     No access to drug program whilst in custody 
     Girlfriend who is a cannabis user 
     Other social peers also interested in cannabis use 
    Motivation for Offending 26 The offender has not revealed any particular motive for his offending conduct. The most logical explanation is that the offence was drug related in the sense that he may have been looking for cash or items to pawn for alcohol or drugs.Attitude to Offence 27 The offender entered a plea at the Local Court. I am satisfied his doing so demonstrated a willingness to be held accountable for his offending conduct. I am sure he recognises and accepts the wrongfulness of his criminal behaviour. I am satisfied he recognises his best chance of rehabilitation depends upon drug abstinence and securing employment. That is called insight and it is a good thing. It, of course, is a harder thing to achieve than to know what it is you need to achieve. However, I am unconvinced any of that will impact upon his future activities unless he is well supported outside the prison gate. So while I accept he is contrite, the contrition is not so profound as, on its own, to guarantee a change of conduct.Plea of guilty 28 For reasons referred to above, the offender ought to receive the full discount of twenty-five percent for his plea.Rehabilitation Prospects 29 Christopher Ryan’s rehabilitation prospects are, at best, clouded. They are dependent upon the level of support, family, foster family and community agencies and Christopher Ryan’s response to them. Contrary to the pre-sentence report, I am concerned with the level of support available to him, not the quality of it. I am impressed with Kim Downing but my concern is whether he will commit to it. 30 No-one was at Court when he was last before the Court. That suggests to me, and there is nothing I have heard from Kim Downing to the contrary, that his support is brittle. She says she is not going to continue in the face of offending conduct. The family otherwise, I think, is also either unable or unwilling to commit. The consequence was he was not supported at Court. Probation and Parole were unable to make contact with his mother. Of six potential numbers available to him on his phonecard, two are taken by his girlfriend, one by his mother and one for the Godparents and one mate. I sense his support base is brittle. 31 I would imagine his best accommodation option may be with his Godparents. I am confirmed in that view from what I heard today. If Probation and Parole or other agencies are ineffective in supporting him with drug and alcohol, vocational and living skill programs, his prospects of re-offending are the greater. 32 He does appear to be in good health and without apparent mental health problems. Both factors are positive rehabilitation indicators. He has expressed a willingness to work and there appear to be two areas - landscape gardening and car-detailing that fall within his current skill base and would provide job satisfaction. There is also a loose possibility of getting labouring work through his Godfather or his Godfather’s contacts. His youth is a factor that also suggests rehabilitation is still a viable and important option.Parity with the Co-Offender 33 His co-offender received thirty hours Community Service Order. Both offenders were young. This offender, however, had reached adulthood, his co-offender had not. That entitled the co-offender to the particular benefits Parliament has reserved for offenders who have not yet reached adulthood. In particular, his co-offender was entitled to access to the Children’s Court. He was also entitled to be sentenced pursuant to the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act. That Act provides a far less harsh sentencing regime than this offender is subject to under the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 34 The young person had what was referred to as “limited antecedents”. In fairness, this offender’s criminal antecedents are not as extensive as I have seen for some young offenders his age. While parity is not appropriate, for those reasons, some downward thrust of the overall sentence on account of his co-offender’s lenient treatment is. Rehabilitation is still the primary aim when sentencing offenders who are on the cusp of adulthood. 35 The sentencing option that I have determined will have particular conditions. It will be a three month option when the final sentence will be finalised. The conditions that I am now enumerating will also be his parole conditions but, for the moment, I am giving him Section 11 bail and these conditions are to be regarded as bail conditions. They are designed to foster Christopher Ryan’s rehabilitation.36 Pursuant to Section 11 of the Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act, I grant the offender bail for a period of three months from today. The bail will be in the following conditions - 
     
     (1) He is to report to Probation and Parole by 5pm on 9 February 2007 at the Mount Druitt Probation and Parole office. 
      
     (2) He is to accept supervision and obey all reasonable directions of Probation and Parole and participate in all programs required of him by his case manager. 
      
     (3) He is to reside with Mr and Mrs Downing at 15 Walshe Grove Bidwill. 
      
     (4) He is to do all he can to obtain employment and once in employment to maintain it. 
    37 I forgot to ask him, does he play sports?STYLES: Your Honour, I’m not instructed in that regard.Your Honour, he’s shaking his head, not really, not in any--HIS HONOUR: Because one of the things I would like to do is put him in a sporting team if I can, all right. 
     
      
      (5) He is to submit to random drug testing three times monthly for the period of the bail. That is nine test results I want in here in three months’ time. Any dirty or negative test result or any failure to attend or any failure to comply with test procedure is to be deemed a breach of the bail and I would want to be notified within twenty-four hours. 
       
      (6) I commend to the Probation and Parole programs related to drug and alcohol management, vocational assistance and living skills. 
      
    The bail can be entered downstairs today.38 Mr Ryan, you are at most risk of blowing this within the next week. If you get out today and you try and chase your mates and have a good time tonight, you probably will blow it straightaway. Do you understand that?OFFENDER: Yes.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Donna Kathleen Powell appears for sentence today having pleaded guilty at an early opportunity to knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug, the prohibited drug being heroin. It is a somewhat unusual offence because it is fairly clear that Ms Powell became involved in this offence only after a much more serious offender locked her keys out of the car and thus needed transport. 2 The offence arose when police began a controlled operation into the activities of a Marie Collier and a Suzanne Middlemiss. Ms Middlemiss and Ms Collier were drug suppliers. An undercover officer arranged to buy some drugs from them. It was Ms Collier’s job to deliver the drugs to the undercover officer and receive money in payment. However she, as I mentioned, locked her keys out of the car and needed an alternative form of transport. She therefore contacted Ms Powell, an acquaintance of hers. Ms Powell picked her up in the location where she locked the keys in the car, drove her to the location where Ms Middlemiss was to meet the undercover officer and then accompanied Ms Middlemiss and the undercover officer to the latter’s car, where she sat in the rear seat whilst the transaction took place. Ms Middlemiss handed over a significant quantity of drugs, 27.8 grams of heroin, and received $9,400 in return. 3 The circumstances of the offence led to a dispute on the factual basis for this sentence. It is Ms Powell’s case that she only learnt that Ms Middlemiss was going to supply drugs to the undercover officer as they were walking towards the undercover officer’s car. I do not accept that. It is quite contrary to human behaviour that a person such as Ms Middlemiss, who was about to commit a serious criminal offence involving the supply of drugs for money, would invite a person with no knowledge and no involvement in the offence to witness her offending. I am satisfied, and indeed satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, that Ms Powell was made aware much earlier of what Ms Middlemiss proposed to do. 4 I will sentence Ms Powell on the basis that she learnt, after picking up Ms Middlemiss from where she had locked her keys in the car, and before they arrived at the location where the undercover officer was, what Ms Middlemiss planned to do. 5 It is difficult to understand why Ms Powell did what she did. One can understand perhaps continuing to drive Ms Middlemiss to the location, but to then get out of the car and involve herself in the offending as she did is, in the light of her lack of criminal history, something which is puzzling. Nevertheless, as I have said before, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that is what she did. She now recognises that what she did was criminal. She should have said “no” to what Ms Middlemiss asked her to do. 6 Ms Powell is forty years of age. She has some minor matters on her criminal history committed some time ago, but they have nothing to do with drugs. She has been in a relationship with her partner for the last twenty years and has two teenage boys. One of them suffered a serious injury to his eye, causing him to lose the sight in that eye some years ago and that has caused him to become a bit withdrawn. The other is exuberant and plays representative soccer. Both boys require the attention of their mother and substantial involvement of her in their upbringing. The offender’s partner is a hard worker, and thus it falls to the offender to look after the household. She has, it would seem, done that admirably. 7 The law is clear: those who traffic to a substantial degree must receive sentences of full-time custody unless there are exceptional circumstances. In this case I am not satisfied that Ms Powell was trafficking to a substantial degree. She pleaded guilty to an offence of knowingly taking part in the supply of the prohibited drug and, as I have made clear I trust, involved herself to a relatively minor degree. Indeed, in physical terms she did very little to assist in the transaction beyond driving Ms Middlemiss to the location where it would occur. 8 It is true, as the Crown suggests, that the events could not have occurred without the offender driving Ms Middlemiss, but that does not escalate the matter into anything other than the lower range of offending for this type of conduct. So I am not satisfied that Ms Middlemiss was trafficking to a substantial degree. That means that a custodial sentence is not required in the absence of exceptional circumstances. The circumstances, in any case, are not exceptional. They are relatively commonplace. 9 The question then becomes as to what sentence I should impose upon Ms Powell. Mr Styles began by suggesting that a s 9 bond was appropriate. I am not satisfied at all that that is an appropriate punishment. The offender involved herself in very serious criminal behaviour. She must be punished for what she has done and I am not satisfied that a bond under s 9 achieves any effective punishment at all. I take into account, of course, the offender’s plea at an early opportunity. I will not quantify the discount I have allowed for that circumstance, but will say that it is one of a number of factors that have led to me imposing a different form of sentence that I would otherwise have imposed. 10 I am satisfied that Ms Powell must be punished, however I am not satisfied that that needs to be done by way of a custodial sentence. In my view the most appropriate outcome is an order that she perform community service. The offender has been assessed as suitable to perform community service by the Probation and Parole Service in a report which I received, tendered by the Crown. 11 The order I make therefore is this, Ms Powell is convicted. She is to perform 300 hours community service. For the purposes of the administration of this order, she is to report to the Mt Druitt District Office of the Probation and Parole Service within seven days of today.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Sentencing is not a matter of absolute truths or mathematical precision. In R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131 the Court of Criminal Appeal in discussing Pt 4 Div 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, whilst noting that it was a further pointer towards the continuation of a wider area of discretion, it was one without resort to some rigid mechanistic or arithmetic approach, which would be unsuited to the difficult task of sentencing [126]. In Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [39], [42] and [46], in the vicinity of that part of the judgment which has come to dominate sentencing in New South Wales, the majority of the High Court said, that it was highly undesirable that the process of sentencing should become more technical than it was already. It should be emphasised that aspects of sentencing were not to be attended by “excessive subtleties and refinements”. It also pointed out in that judgment that sentencing was not a process that leads to a single correct answer, arrived at by some process admitting of mathematical precision. This was precisely the thrust of the High Court judgment in Markarian of two years ago. In Wong v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 584 at [77] the High Court in striking down guideline judgments for Commonwealth sentencing in New South Wales, referred to the core of the difficulty lying in the “complexity of the sentencing task”. The High Court has continually acknowledged that a sentencing judge must take into account a wide variety of matters which concern the seriousness of the offence for which the offender stands to be sentenced and the personal history and circumstances of the offender. These matters, of course, as the High Court said in that judgment, sometimes lead to competing and contradictory considerations. Of course I am mindful that since Pearce and Wong were decided, s 3A and s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in their current form have been imposed, if I might use that expression in a neutral fashion, upon sentencing in New South Wales. 2 This case presents the types of difficulties that are discussed in decisions of very high authority, that dominate the proper approach to the exercise of the sentencing discretion. This case of course, throws up considerations that were discussed in Henry v The Queen, the guideline judgment in relation to armed robbery, (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. In that judgment there was a guideline fixed in relation to the crime of armed robbery, that is, robbery with an offensive weapon, carrying a maximum penalty of twenty years. The Court reaffirmed what had been said in Jurisic concerning guideline judgments, that guideline judgments were to constrain sentencing discretion but were “intended to be indicative only”, they were not to be regarded as “rules binding on sentencing judges”. Jurisic had held that decisions of appellate courts on sentencing are not be treated as “binding precedents”. A wide sentencing discretion was still recognised even when courts were to properly take into account the guideline. The Court in Henry, through the judgment of the learned Chief Justice, adopted, in the context to discussing the appropriateness of guideline judgments, what had been said by Acting Chief Justice Mahoney in the unreported decision of Lattouf from 1996. There his Honour had said: 
     
      
      “General sentencing principles must be established so that the community may know that sentences which will be imposed, and so that sentencing judges will know, the kind and order of a sentence which is appropriate that they impose, but of course, principles are necessarily framed in general terms. General principles must of their nature be adjusted to the individual case if justice is to be achieved.  
      
    3 His Honour went on to say: 
     
      
      “There is a public interest in the adoption and articulation of sentencing principles, which will deter the commission of serious crime and punish those who commit it...but there are other interests to which the sentencing process must have regard. These are other objectives which the sentencing process must seek to achieve. Paramount amongst these is the achievement of justice in the individual case”  
      (see  
      Henry 
       at [10]). 
      
    4 The learned Chief Justice said that these observations of the Acting Chief Justice were not in conflict with a system of guideline judgments, as had been established in Jurisic (at [11]). 5 This prisoner Akok Noi appears for sentence in relation to a very serious offence indeed. It is an offence that carries a maximum penalty of twenty-five years imprisonment. The offence is an offence of robbery using corporeal violence with wounding, committed on 20 June 2006 at Parramatta when the prisoner, in company with another man, robbed a man by the name of Praveen Kumar Suvama of a mobile phone, a Commonwealth Bank keycard and an ANZ bank keycard. Mr Suvama was a man going about his private business late at night in the Parramatta business district. There is available to me an agreed statement of facts which sets out in considerable detail the circumstances of the offence, parts of which I will refer to in this judgment. There is no need obviously, with an agreed statement of facts, to recite the entirety of the facts. The victim shortly after quarter to eleven, was making his way home, having finished work. At around about 11 o’clock he was attacked by two males. One pointed a knife at him, this was the prisoner, and the other held a small object, which appeared to be a small, black pistol. The prisoner at the time of the commission of this offence was sixteen years and ten months, approximately. The prisoner had been born, as I understand it from the available information, on 4 August 1989. The other man has been referred to by various names but is known to the police by the name of Mark Majok Chol. He was born in September 1985. He was thus approximately four years older than the prisoner. He, like the prisoner at the relevant time, had no prior criminal convictions. In any event, when attacked the victim was the subject of demands for his property. He had his mobile phone taken from his right hand by the co-offender. As he started to pull his wallet out of his pocket he was cut in the hand with the knife in circumstances which aren’t made clear in the facts. One would have to assume the act of the use of the knife was a deliberate act, although it is not entirely clear how the knife was applied to the hand, save for the fact that, on the facts available to me, it occurred as the victim was removing his wallet from his hand. Importantly, and I have not ignored this fact, the prisoner then made a sinister threat to the victim by holding the knife near the victim’s eye and said, “I’ll put one more to your eye, hurry up”. This would suggest that the earlier cutting was certainly not accidental. The prisoner received a wallet of the victim. The prisoner opened it up and the prisoner removed the victim’s Commonwealth keycard. He gave it, however, to the co-offender who went to a nearby ATM. But when told there was no balance after being given the PIN number, the victim then removed his ANZ keycard from his wallet and handed that to this prisoner. The co-offender again took the keycard from this prisoner. The victim, under threat obviously of violence, gave over his PIN number for the ANZ card and $600 was removed from the ATM. 6 The taking of the money from the ATM is reflected in the matter on the Form 1 which I am required to take into account, that is, the offence of dishonestly obtaining money by deception, being as I say, the use of the card at the ATM. The prisoner threatened the victim and he was told effectively to go in the opposite direction from which the offenders were to head. The victim asked for his cards back and apparently they were thrown away. The victim was not deterred, however, and courageously, notwithstanding the injury to his hand, pursued his attackers and was able to record the registration number of the motor vehicle in which they left the scene. The victim was finally spoken to by police about eighteen minutes after the offence was committed. He was taken to the hospital and he received fourteen sutures in the wound and I’ve seen photographs of the wound in the web of the hand between the thumb and the fingers. He was kept overnight for observation. He was released the following morning. I do not have a victim impact statement but it is quite clear on the facts of this matter that the victim would have been distressed by these events and no doubt these events would live long in his memory. The victim would appear, however, to have recovered from the injury suffered as there is no evidence of any complications. 7 Police are to be congratulated on the speed of their investigation. The motor vehicle was traced to a person living in Avalon, who had a connection with the prisoner. Police conducted a surveillance of addresses known to be connected to this prisoner, as he was known to police to have been stopped in relation to traffic offences, driving the very same car, on 30 May 2006. Police conducted a surveillance operation which involved following the prisoner who was seen to drive the vehicle some time after 9am to school. They also executed a search warrant whilst the prisoner was at school and obtained various items of clothing that were linked to the commission of the offence. Ultimately, the prisoner was arrested shortly after 1.20pm. In the motor vehicle was found a small quantity of cannabis, weighing 7.9 grams, with which the prisoner was charged for having possession of the drug. That is a matter on the Form 1 which I am to take into account in sentencing the prisoner for the principal offence. There is no evidence before me as to the origin of the cannabis, but the prisoner claimed in an interview with police, it would seem quite falsely, that the cannabis had been taken from the victim. 8 The prisoner first of all declined to be interviewed but spoke to his father and then agreed to be interviewed and made admissions of his involvement in the robbery. Clearly from the detail of the interview and from matters raised in cross-examination of the prisoner by the Crown, he sought to downplay his involvement in the commission of this offence. He denied, amongst other things, having possession of a weapon or being responsible particularly for the injury to the victim’s hands, claiming that the victim cut his hand by grabbing the keys that the prisoner had in his possession. This was clearly observed given the nature of the injuries. In any event, as the matter has unfolded, the prisoner has not in evidence before me denied his responsibility for the injuries suffered by the victim. The prisoner’s admissions of course confirm what was already a strong Crown case based upon a body of circumstantial evidence. Ultimately, DNA testing of the prisoner’s clothing revealed a match between the DNA profile of the victim and a stained area on the trousers. Also, surveillance footage obtained, subsequent to the arrest of the prisoner, confirmed persons wearing clothing similar to that obtained from the prisoner’s residence. 9 The prisoner gave evidence about the circumstance of the offence, particularly it would seem on my analysis of it, focusing upon the issue of the circumstances in which he came to commit the offence, rather than the particular perpetration of those matters set out in the facts. Clearly, the prisoner drove to Parramatta from the area in which he lived in the motor vehicle to which I have referred. I have noted that he was in company with an older man. The prisoner claims that the older man provided him with a knife. I have no reason to doubt this claim. As I understand the evidence available to me there is no evidence of the knife being found in the prisoner’s possession subsequently. In any event the critical issue that arose from the evidence of the prisoner concerned the extent to which there had been planning. I could not conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner left the area in which he lived to go to Parramatta for the purposes of committing a robbery of any type. However it is clear that the proposal to commit a robbery, which I am prepared to accept came from the older person, was one that arose sometime before the victim was chosen.10 There was an admission in the prisoner’s interview to the police that arose in cross-examination, that the prisoner had seen the victim whilst driving the motor vehicle. The planning, of course, as the Crown conceded in its submissions, was not sophisticated. It could be fairly described as limited over a period of time, but certainly not limited to a period of a minute before the robbery, as the prisoner sought to suggest in his evidence. There was, to be fairly said, in the prisoner’s evidence before me some prevarication and some attempt, again as he had in his interview but not as extensively, to downplay his role in this matter. Particularly in his evidence before me to distance himself from matters that might be regarded as aggravations of the objective criminality. Ultimately on the totality of the evidence I must conclude that there was some planning in relation to this matter, albeit over a limited period of time. Ultimately it is, on my assessment of the matter including of course the facts the Crown present to me, the case that the older person must be seen as the primary mover, although the prisoner is clearly solely responsible for the injuries suffered by the victim. 11 I noted in relation to the facts that the prisoner, in taking property from the victim, deferred to the older person. He took command of both cards in order to remove money by the use of ATM machines. The other man of course has not been arrested. I have been informed that he has left Australia. He has lived in the United States I understand for some period of time and is believed to be back in Sudan. In due course if he returns to Australia he will be amenable to justice. The prisoner, as I mentioned in passing earlier, had no prior findings of guilt, although the facts suggest that he had been at least interviewed in relation to some traffic matters on 30 May 2006. The prisoner was at the time of the commission of this offence, attending school and has returned to that school. I will refer to material concerning his education shortly. 12 On his arrest he remained in custody for a period of thirty-five days, as I understand it, before being released on bail. He was held in custody in a Juvenile Justice establishment given his age. I am prepared to accept that to some extent his time in custody has served as a salutary experience. In sentencing the prisoner, bearing in mind he pleaded guilty at the Children’s Court as I understand it, I am prepared to give the prisoner a discount of twenty-five per cent upon the otherwise appropriate sentence for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. Of course, the Crown case was strong, particularly aided by the prisoner’s admissions but was strong nevertheless. However, the utilitarian value of plea of guilty is not one to be measured by reference to the strength of the Crown case and his plea was entered at the first reasonable opportunity. 13 In relation to the prisoner’s background, I have a body of material from the prisoner, to some extent the prisoner’s father who gave impressive evidence before me, a very detailed report from the Department of Juvenile Justice, which reports author gave evidence before me and a report from a psychologist. I also have some references from persons that have had association with the prisoner. I might just briefly summarise that material. As I understand the matter the prisoner was born to his parents in the Sudan. He is the eldest of six children. His parents emigrated to Australia in December 2002 through a refugee program. As I understand the matter the family are Christians, however, the country from which they come is primarily an Islamic country. The father of the prisoner was an educator who was alleged to be educating Muslim students with Christianity. The prisoner’s father has explained, and I accept, that he was forced to leave his country and his family initially because he came to the attention of certain national security persons as a result of his actions.14 The prisoner’s father first of all fled to Egypt so he would not be detained and it would seem that after some period of time the family was reunited with him in Egypt. There the family lived for two years under circumstances of considerable hardship. One of the hardships was that Mr Noi was unable to obtain employment. After the family arrived in Australia the prisoner recommenced his education. The material available to me suggests that he had stopped receiving education at the age of ten whilst living in Sudan, mainly due to financial difficulties, exacerbated, one would have thought, by the background to which I have referred. The prisoner at a very young age obtained some employment in Egypt to support his family and on arrival in Australia he was enrolled at Patrician Brothers College. He was referred to a college at Granville to engage in intensive English lessons. I would assume that he came here with little English and returned to Patrician Brothers for the final semester of year 9. It would be quite evident from what I have outlined that his education has been severely disrupted up until the present time. 15 At the present time the prisoner is seeking to complete his Higher School Certificate and it is clear on the material available to me that whilst at school he has had to travel a very difficult and lengthy journey to arrive at where he is. A report from the school, dated 23 April 2007, points to the special educational assistance the prisoner has received. He is a regular attender at school and is said to have made a genuine attempt in all subjects studied. He is regarded as polite and cooperative at school. Due to his language problems he is said to find social problems difficult to solve and can be stressed by situations that arise out of misunderstandings, largely as a result of language difficulties. In 2006 a psychologist’s test at the school assessed him to be in the low average intelligence range. His learning difficulties were identified in the area of language and expressing himself. Also, explaining his thoughts and actions is extremely difficult for him. Writing for him is extremely difficult as well, and he has required special assistance in that regard. I note in relation to the report from the school that after his return from custody last year he was regarded as diligent and cooperative. He is regarded as a person who has behaved since his return from custody and has abided by school rules in relation to the issues of punctuality and uniform. He is said to work well in class activities, and his special needs coordinator has noticed over a period of time considerable growth for the good, both academically and socially. 16 The prisoner is an athlete who plays basketball. His family in Australia however has not had a smooth time, even allowing for the many difficulties persons from their background would face in Australia. There have been difficulties in the marriage. First of all, Mrs Noi left the family home and then Mr Noi left the family home and, as I understand it, remains separated from his wife. However, notwithstanding that separation he has maintained contact with the children of the marriage who range in age from that of the prisoner down to a child aged four. Obviously most of the children are attending school. There was a great deal of unhappiness within the family arising out of the various separations, which has not assisted them in their transition to a normal life, from the many traumas they have suffered over many years. 17 As I said earlier, I was impressed with the evidence of the prisoner’s father. He expressed concern for the prisoner and expressed, perhaps mistakenly, some responsibility for the current situation. He believes that he had not foreseen the situation that created the opportunity for the prisoner to commit the current offence and spoke of the effect upon the family of the prisoner’s arrest, his time in custody, and the threat of a term of imprisonment. I accept the family is a law abiding family, endeavouring to do their very best to adjust to a very different cultural setting. Mr Noi senior spoke of his surprise as to the arrest of the prisoner on this matter and I accept as a fact that the conduct of the prisoner in being armed with a knife, albeit for a relatively short period of time and assaulting people, is entirely uncharacteristic. There is not in the prisoner’s background, or since the commission of this offence, the hallmarks of antisocial activity which would lead one to come to the conclusion that the conduct of the offender was representative of a violent propensity. The prisoner’s father has endeavoured to take various steps to ensure the prisoner does not come in conflict with the law again. He has noted the effect upon the family and the Sudanese community of the arrest of the prisoner. Of course the extent of the effect upon the community is not a matter about which I can make much comment, but I do accept that the family has been affected and has been greatly stressed by the circumstances of this matter. Of course I naturally acknowledge that the victim of this matter has been no doubt considerably more stressed than the family, arising out of the prisoner’s conduct and the conduct of the co-offender. 18 I have in support of the evidence of Mr Noi and the prisoner, to the extent that it touches upon personal matters, a report from Anglicare, from the coordinator for southern Sudanese community members in Australia. This gentleman, as I understand it, Mr Cawuop, is familiar with the family’s circumstances and speaks of the respectful character of the prisoner and the family; the fact that the prisoner is a person who is law abiding in his general conduct; that the prisoner is a person who is seeking to better himself as are other members of his family and as a young man who is capable of rehabilitation. I have taken his opinion into account. The Juvenile Justice officer has written, as is often the case in these matters, a sympathetic report. Again, judges are not blind to the fact that people in the position of Juvenile Justice officers will write reports that might, of their nature, be prone to be sympathetic to offenders. On the other hand, the officer is an experienced officer who has seen a range of offenders over a period of time. I do not suggest for a moment that his report is biased. He concludes in his assessment that the prisoner is a generally reserved and friendly person, who is cooperative with the Juvenile Justice Service. Before the preparation of the report he was not previously known to them. 19 The officer said that his capacity to express himself was limited which caused him to have some questions about his intellectual functioning. He claimed that the prisoner did not seek to minimise his actions or offer excuses for his behaviour, although I have noted in his evidence before me some attempt in a comparatively minor way to downplay aspects of his involvement. I should say in passing in relation to this matter, that this is not an uncommon circumstance, particularly for young offenders who find it difficult to confront the seriousness of their offending behaviour. The Juvenile Justice officer has confirmed the generally positive view of the prisoner by a range of people who have seen the prisoner in a range of circumstances, the uncharacteristic nature of the offending and the support the prisoner has in the future. He notes in the report that due to the serious and violent nature of the offence, intervention by the service may be beneficial in assisting the prisoner to understand the underlying reasons for his offending behaviour and it is recommended that he receive counselling in a range of ways.20 He also noted in the report that given the nature of the prisoner’s current offence, the issue of exposure to violence had been explored with the prisoner and his parents. The prisoner is not a person, however, who has been exposed to a significant level of violence in his home environment, either in the Sudan or in Australia. I have seen several Sudanese offenders before me, young offenders committing violent crimes, in a range of ways. One feature I have noticed of such offenders is that some of these offenders, by reason of very, very tragic and violent upbringings, appear to be immune to the effects of violence. This prisoner is not in that category and thus in my view is a person who will be able in the future to avoid situations such as that, that give rise to this matter. 21 There is a psychologist’s report which I have taken into account. Dealing with the matters that touch upon the psychologist’s qualifications, I note that he administered, if I may call it colloquially, an IQ test applying what is called the RAVENS test. He noted that Mr Noi achieved a score in the bottom half of the average range of functioning, which was consistent with his general presentation. His reading, albeit a test conducted in English, was rated at about ten and a half year old level. He has achieved what is called survival literacy but this is an area of weakness for him as one would expect. He concluded on the basis of this assessment and the history that there is no indication that Mr Noi demonstrates a developmental disability or a significant limitation in intelligence. He did not conclude that there was any suggestion of mental illness. There is no history of acting out or antisocial behaviour, as I earlier mentioned. The prisoner is a person who appears to have an interest in what is called ‘neatness and order’, which appears to be a family trait, and the prisoner denied any history of drug or alcohol abuse of any significance, although I note the possession of the cannabis.22 He concluded ultimately that the prisoner did not suffer any relevant mental illness, but he was a person who would benefit from the assistance of professionals, particularly, in the areas of counselling in matters such as social attitudes and behaviours, victim empathy, alcohol and drug education and one might have thought, anger management, in the circumstances of this matter. I have taken into account a body of material provided to me concerning the position in Sudan. The circumstances of the prisoner’s coming to Australia no doubt reflect much of the instability of that country, although as I have pointed out this prisoner has not suffered the high levels of violence that have been visited upon other refugees that have come to the country in the past. 23 I have been provided with some statistics in relation to sentencing of offenders in relation to offences pursuant to s 96 Crimes Act who are under eighteen. The sample is so small as to provide little guidance and in any event statistics themselves provide limited assistance as has been discussed on a number of occasions by the Court of Criminal Appeal, particularly in the case of Bloomfield in 1998. 24 I have had regard, of course, to the submissions made on behalf of both the Crown and the accused. I have been provided with very helpful written submissions by the learned counsel for the accused. I might just briefly deal with those submissions in passing, although they have all been taken into account in determining this matter. I note that the Crown submits that the offence is one of the “utmost gravity”. The Crown properly pointed out that ordinarily to impose a full-time custodial sentence would be the appropriate approach and that ordinarily exceptional circumstances would apply not to do so.25 The Crown very helpfully pointed to the use of the knife. The fact that there was limited planning. He conceded the offence was unsophisticated but certainly would have a significant impact upon the victim. He noted the prisoner was in company, in circumstances I have already commented upon. He noted of course, the terms of s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and pointed to matters arising under s 21A of that Act, particularly the issue of being in company and the aspect of planning. The Crown’s essential position was that the tenderness of his age did not entitle him to escape proper weight being given to matters of general and personal deterrence. 26 With regard to the issues of specific deterrence, it was submitted on behalf of the accused that it should be noted that the prisoner had acted out of character, that he had strong family support and that he had not re-offended in the eleven months or longer since the offence occurred. It was noted he no longer associated with his older offender for obvious reasons and the prisoner had shown signs of rehabilitation by his return to education. These matters I have taken into account.27 Reference was made to the guideline judgement in Henry and related cases. It is clear that the guideline promulgated in Henry, albeit for a less serious offence than that with which I am concerned now, but a similar offence, applies to children. The learned Crown and defence counsel have taken me through what could be called the “criteria” or features of a common case involving a young offender. I note in relation to the guideline, in its terms, that the characteristics as the learned Chief Justice described them, do not represent the full range of factors relevant to the sentencing exercise and of course there will be inherent variability in some of these characteristics. The extent of violence, the degree of vulnerability and other matters. I need not dwell upon those matters.28 In SDM [2001] NSWCCA 158, the Court of Criminal Appeal held that the guideline judgment in Henry applied in relation to the sentencing of children. However, the court acknowledged in that case that the sentencing of children involved special requirements to be taken into account, some statutory that might operate to reduce the need for a sense to reflect general deterrence whilst requiring greater attention by the sentencing officer to rehabilitation; see para 10. The truth is that in sentencing this offender I am required to have regard to s 6 Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act. That particular provision is not to be given lip service, it is a matter of some considerable significance. There is no defined border, however, between the circumstances in which a person may be treated as an adult, even though they are a child, and a person who is a child, who should not attract the sort of attention that has been discussed in decisions such as Pham (1991) 55 ACR 12 and of course The Queen v AEM and Ors [2002] NSWCCA 58.29 In regard to the issue of s 6 Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act I note the observation that it is desirable wherever possible to allow education or employment of a child to proceed without interruption. The desirability of allowing a child to reside in his or her own home and, of course, that children who commit offences must bear responsibility for their actions but because of their state of dependency and immaturity require guidance and assistance. One of the key features of the submissions put on behalf of the prisoner is that there is in this prisoner, both culturally, socially and intellectually, a degree of immaturity, that itself may be reflected in the very facts of the case. The willingness to follow the lead of an older person and the willingness to act precipitously, as no doubt the wounding of the victim reveals, where that kind of conduct was uncharacteristic.30 I note, of course, that it has been long held, back to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in GDP in (1991) 53 ACR 112 and before in many other decisions, the approach to the sentencing of children involves, as I have pointed out, considerations that might otherwise not have a role to play in sentencing of adults for similar offences. In R v DM [2005] NSWCCA 181 and in DB v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 27 it was noted that the principle underpinning the practice of imposing lesser sentence on youthful offenders, than those imposed on adults who commit similar crimes, lies in the recognition of the immaturity of youth. The fact that a particular offender may have been a willing participant does not dispose of the need to have regard to the extent to which his relative immaturity made him vulnerable to the influence of an older person. In the case of DB, as I understand it, it was an older family member.31 I must say in passing, without necessarily relying upon it, that there is a debate in scientific circumstances as to the development of the brain in teenagers and the development of personality in circumstances that suggest that those of tender years by reason of biological factors are necessarily not in, if I could use the expression, a psychological state to make the type of mature judgments that adults may be expected to be capable of making. This area of scientific investigation of course is still developing and of course, as I say, I have no evidence about it as such before me. But it seems to me it reflects in parallel the way in which courts, for example, have approached the treatment of juvenile offenders. I was referred to some comparative cases which are referred to in the written submissions, such as GS [2006] NSWCCA 410, which as was fairly pointed out, is a sentence matter in relation to an offence of malicious wounding which carries much less maximum penalty, but involved much more serious injuries and one would have thought far more deliberate wounding. Of course the decision of Blackman and Walters [2001] NSWCCA 121 is noted. Comparative sentences are usually of only marginal assistance.32 It might be fairly said in Blackman and Walters that the criminality involved there concerned criminality of greater deliberation and planning than arose in this particular matter. It might be fairly said too, that those offenders were much more mature than this offender. In one sense, given the number of victims and what was involved, the criminality was greater. Ultimately, however, for the determination of this matter, Blackman and Walters provides guidance in relation to two issues, one is a proper approach to imposing a sentence that will be suspended, confirming what had been said by the Court of Criminal Appeal in JCE, and of course, reflecting what had been said with considerable eloquence and detail in the judgment of Justice Howie, in Zamagias. I have had particular regard to Zamagias and what his Honour said about the proper approach to the determination of matters in the way in which I have foreshadowed here. 33 The other aspect of Blackman and Walters that I have taken into account is the adoption by the learned Chief Judge at Common Law of what was said by King CJ in Yardley v Betts, a South Australian decision from 1979. 34 There his Honour said at 112-3 of (1979) 22 SASR 108: 
     
      
      “The protection of the community is...contributed to by the successful rehabilitation of offenders. This aspect of sentencing should never be lost sight of and it assumes particular importance to first offenders and those who have not developed settled criminal ways. If a sentence had the effect of turning an offender towards a criminal way of life, protection of the community is to that extent impaired. If the sentence induces or assists an order to avoid offending in the future, protection of the community is to that extent enhanced. To say that the criminal law exists in the protection of the community is not to say that severity is to be regarded as the sentencing norm.” 
      
    35 In this particular matter I approach the sentencing of the prisoner on the basis that in dealing with an offence of this type for an adult offender, clearly a term of imprisonment of some length much greater than that I foreshadow, would be appropriate here. But in light of the background of the prisoner, his immaturity, his relative youth at the relevant time, in determining the ultimate outcome I believe it is appropriate, consistent with authority relevant to particular types of cases involving children, to place somewhat lesser weight upon matters of general deterrence and personal deterrence than would otherwise be appropriate.36 In this regard I have had proper attention to s 3A Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act, all the matters set out therein are taken into account, of course. They do not have equal weight in a particular sentencing exercise. Four of the matters identified in s 3A were specifically referred to by the High Court in Veen No 2. In that particular matter the four purposes of sentencing identified by the majority of the High Court were said to be guideposts which may point in conflicting or opposite directions, and that clearly is the case here. In this particular matter the promotion of the rehabilitation of the prisoner is, given his youth, a significant matter and it is a matter that I have given particular weight to in light of his progress since his arrest in relation to this matter.37 I have referred in passing to s 21A, and particularly matters of aggravation identified by the Crown, which clearly arise in this particular matter. It should be noted, of course, that s 21A itself provides that the fact that any particular aggravation or mitigating factor is relevant and known to the court, does not require the court to increase or reduce the sentence for the offence. Specifically, however, in relation to the mitigating factors, it seems to me that ultimately the conclusions that are appropriate here are, firstly, that the offence was not obviously part of organised criminal activity; the prisoner did not have any record of previous convictions; that he was a person of good character; that he is unlikely to re-offend and that he has, with the support of his family and other professionals, excellent prospects of rehabilitation, particularly having regard to his age. He has expressed his remorse for his offending and in my view that was first reflected in his decision, notwithstanding legal advice, to admit his involvement in the commission of the offence, albeit that he did seek to downplay his role. I note his plea of guilty. Of course he receives a discrete discount for that. Of course there was, it should be fairly said, the fact that he, by that plea of guilty also demonstrated some remorse. He has, as I have pointed out, expressed remorse to those that have interviewed him.38 One last matter, if I may call it of a technical nature, is of course the need to take into account the matters on the Form 1. In that regard I have obviously noted what has been said about these matters in Attorney General’s Application No 1 (2002) 56 NSWLR 147. It is observed in that judgment that matters to be taken into account on a Form 1 may mean greater weight being given to matters of personal deterrence and the community’s entitlement to extract retribution. Sometimes matters on a Form 1 fully and properly inform the true character of the criminality. In this particular matter I note one of the matters on the Form 1 is directly related to the commission of the armed robbery in circumstances I have outlined. The other matter reflects some use of cannabis, which reflects a matter about which at the current time there appears to be no personal problem for the prisoner. I appreciate of course that matters on a Form 1 may require an additional penalty for the principal sentence. Sometimes it will be small, sometimes it would be substantial. As the High Court held in Markarian and there is no need to reduce this process to mathematical precision. The Court of Criminal Appeal in the guideline judgment said so three years before Markarian in any event.39 I have taken into account the matters on the Form 1 in accordance with the requirements of the guideline judgment. But in my view ultimately they do not substantially enhance the seriousness of the offending revealed in the principal offence. The fact of taking the $600 is a matter specifically taken into account as a fact relevant to the principal offence in any event.40 Thus, in this particular matter I conclude that the appropriate order, taking into account the time the prisoner has spent in custody, is to impose a term of imprisonment which with the discount for the plea of guilty rounding the figure slightly upwards comes to a period of two years. 41 In relation to the offence to which you pleaded guilty, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment for two years pursuant to s 12 Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I order that the execution of the sentence be suspended for the term of the sentence. I direct that you be released from custody on condition that you enter into a good behaviour bond for the term of the sentence. Conditions applying during the term of the bond will be as follows: firstly, you will be required to appear before court if called to do so at any time; secondly, you are to be of good behaviour; thirdly, you are to advise the registrar of the District Court or the clerk of the criminal listing directorate of any change of residential address; fourthly, you are to accept the supervision and guidance of the Department of Juvenile Justice throughout the period of the bond and obey all reasonable directions of the officers of that service, especially as to any directions regarding alcohol and drug counselling and as to educational or work related programs; fifthly, to enable such supervision and guidance to commence you are to report to the officer in charge of the Juvenile Justice Service at Blacktown within seven days of today. I will require the Juvenile Justice Service to provide me with a report in relation to you every six months during the period of the bond from now.42 Do you understand the terms of that bond?43 OFFENDER: Yes, I do.44 HIS HONOUR: What are the terms of that bond?45 OFFENDER: ..(not transcribable).. 46 HIS HONOUR: You will have to obey all reasonable directions of the officers of the Juvenile Justice Service. What I might do in relation to the condition, Mr Crown and Ms Way, is perhaps amend that order to include possible referral to the Probation and Parole Service if the Juvenile Justice Service does not regard it as appropriate for them to continue supervision. They may get to the point where they may say that he should be referred on to Probation and Parole, not because he’s a problem but simply because he’s outgrown them, if you understand what I mean.47 ALLISON: Yes, your Honour.48 HIS HONOUR: You also have to report to the Department of Juvenile Justice within seven days of today, do you understand that?49 OFFENDER: (No audible reply) 50 HIS HONOUR: I would suggest you go there today.51 I have explained to the offender the conditions of this bond, its obligations. I should tell you the consequences of the bond are these, that if you fail to be of good behaviour or if you fail to obey the reasonable directions of the officers of the Department of Juvenile Justice you will be directed to be called up before me and you will be liable to a term of imprisonment of two years. The older you are the more likely you will go to a gaol for adults, rather than a Juvenile Justice institution. Do you agree to the conditions that I have fixed?52 OFFENDER: Yes, I do.53 HIS HONOUR: Having agreed to the conditions, in my view having understood them, having had them explained, I direct that the bond which I have ordered be forwarded to the prisoner by the Criminal Registry at his address. What is your current address? 15 Seabrook Crescent, Doonside, 2767. To there it will be posted.54 Mr Crown, any technical matters, I’m sorry?55 ALLISON: No, your Honour.56 HIS HONOUR: Any technical matters from you Ms Way?57 WAY: No, thank you.58 HIS HONOUR: Mr Noi, you can leave the dock. 59 ADJOURNEDoOo

   JUDGMENT1 Shannon David Russell was injured in his low back on 2 22 December 2005 in the course of his employment as a removalist. He was employed by J D Thompson Personnel Pty Ltd, a labour hire company trading under the name, Jobwire. His services were provided by Jobwire to Grace Worldwide Australia Pty Ltd, a company trading under the name, Grace Removals. The issues in the proceedings were: 
     
      
      1 Whether the risk of injury was so obvious that the defendant should not be held liable to the plaintiff. 
      
     
     
      
      2 Whether there was contributory negligence on behalf of the plaintiff. 
      
     
     
      
      3 The extent of the responsibility of Jobwire for the purposes of the application of s 151Z of the  
      Workers Compensation Act 
       1987. 
      
     
     
      
      4 The extent of the plaintiff’s injury and ongoing disabilities. 
      
     
     
      
      5 The assessment of his damages for non economic loss, loss of income earning capacity, requirement for future domestic assessment assistance and out-of-pocket expenses, past and future. 
      
    Circumstances of the Accident3 The plaintiff was employed by Jobwire as a removalist for six months prior to his injury. He made a direct application for employment to the defendant, who referred him to Jobwire. He registered with Jobwire and was employed by that organisation and allocated to work with the defendant. 4 At the commencement of his employment he was fit and well. He was aged twenty-five, he is now twenty-eight years old. The plaintiff stated that he was given no induction training. 5 He said the standard equipment on removal vehicles operated by the defendant comprised lifting straps and a two wheeled trolley. At times removalists were also supplied with a piano trolley that had four wheels and a flat base. Lifting straps were designed to be placed under items to be lifted and around the shoulders of the removalist concerned. 6 The plaintiff worked on a casual basis for which he was paid an hourly rate. His hours varied from week to week.7 On 22 December 2005 he was directed as to the work to be done by Craig McPherson, apparently an employee of the defendant, at the defendant’s depot at Mayfield. His initial task occupied him two hours. 8 On return to the Mayfield depot he was instructed by Mr McPherson to take a loaded vehicle to Medowie and to unload it. The plaintiff said he had no part in the loading of the vehicle. The vehicle was not the usual pantechnicon bearing the defendant’s name, but a pantechnicon belonging to Newcastle Truck and Hire. The plaintiff said he asked Mr McPherson if the usual equipment was on the truck and he was told that it was. 9 Mr McPherson allocated another male to accompany the plaintiff on the job. The plaintiff had not previously met this person and he did not know his name. 10 The plaintiff drove the pantechnicon to Medowie and manoeuvred it into position to allow it to be unloaded. On opening the truck he discovered that it was fully loaded and that it contained no lifting straps or trolleys. He telephone Mr McPherson concerning the absence of equipment and was told that there was none left in the warehouse and he was to proceed to unload without it.11 The plaintiff said he then discovered that the co-worker allocated to the task had not previously worked as a furniture removalist. He said he lacked the necessary skills and that he dropped items, failed to carry them properly and that he knocked and chipped walls of the premises to which the items were to be moved. After two hours he rang Mr McPherson and requested that he be replaced. His request was declined, Mr McPherson stating that the defendant was short staffed. He therefore continued to work with the inexperienced co-worker. 12 The last item to be unloaded from the truck was a four drawer filing cabinet in the rear corner of the vehicle. The plaintiff said he slid the cabinet forward and tilted it towards his co-worker. He then squatted to lift the other end. He assessed the weight of the cabinet as reasonable and lifted it. 13 After the cabinet had been lifted to about chest height, he checked and was told by the co-worker that everything was “fine”. They moved it about twelve to eighteen metres into the house. The plaintiff noticed that the co-worker’s hands were slipping and asked him if he wanted to put the cabinet down. The co-worker did not respond, instead he dropped his end of the cabinet to the floor. 14 The plaintiff said he felt a sharp stabbing pain in his back. He stood the cabinet upright and reported the incident to Mr McPherson, who arranged to replace the co-worker with someone with more experience. The plaintiff worked with the replacement worker to complete the Medowie job and returned to the depot. He has not worked since that day.15 No evidence to challenge this version of events was called by the defendant.ISSUE 1 - OBVIOUS RISK16 S 5 of the Civil Liability Act 2002 defines obvious risk as one that in the circumstances would have been obvious to the person who suffered harm. S 5H provides, with certain exceptions that are not relevant to the current claim, that a defendant owes no duty of care to warn of an obvious risk. The defendant submitted that the risk, namely that involved in lifting the filing cabinet when it was full, was obvious. In this case the plaintiff made no allegation that the defendant neglected to warn him of the risk involved in the lifting task he was undertaking when injured. Thus the provisions of s 5H are not to be applied.17 Effectively, the defendant argued that it was not liable to the plaintiff because, as set out in paragraph 7 of the defence, the sole cause of the plaintiff’s accident was the plaintiff’s decision to carry the cabinet with the drawers in place and not emptied of their contents. 18 In respect of this defence, the plaintiff agreed to the following propositions: 
     
      
      1 He did not empty the contents of the cabinet or remove its drawers. 
      
     
     
      
      2 The contents made the cabinet heavier than if it had been empty. 
      
     
     
      
      3 Removing the contents would have reduced the risk. 
      
     
     
      
      4 At the time of his injury he had six months experience in lifting heavy items. 
      
     
     
      
      5 He was aware that he needed to take care when lifting heavy items. 
      
     
     
      
      6 He was aware that his co-worker was inexperienced. 
      
    19 In response to these propositions the plaintiff pointed out that he assessed as reasonable the weight of the cabinet before it was lifted. For that reason he said he did not consider it necessary to empty it of its contents. The defendant did not challenge his evidence that he checked and confirmed that his co-worker was managing the lift and that he asked the co-worker if he wished to put the cabinet down immediately before it was dropped. 20 The defendant called no evidence to establish its contention that in undertaking the lift of the cabinet in the manner described by the plaintiff, he was acting in any way unreasonably. There was no evidence of its weight or that the plaintiff’s assessment of the weight as reasonable was so inappropriate that it represented a failure to take care for his own safety.21 To the contrary, there was evidence that the plaintiff attempted to minimise the risk of lifting the cabinet by obtaining appropriate equipment from the defendant, who told him that the equipment was not available. Further, his request that his inexperienced co-worker be replaced was declined. The plaintiff said that if the usual equipment had been supplied he would have moved the cabinet on a trolley or with the aid of the lifting straps. Either of these methods would remove the risk that one of the removalists would drop the cabinet.22 The result is that I find the cause of the plaintiff’s accident was the failure of the defendant to provide the equipment normally available to persons engaged on its behalf in moving heavy items. The very purpose of providing the equipment was to minimise the risk of injury to persons engaged in employment that necessarily involved heavy lifting. 23 Thus the risk of the plaintiff’s injury was both reasonably foreseeable and a risk that a reasonable person would take action to guard against. It was a risk that was preventable without undue inconvenience or expense. The defendant’s failure to provide the necessary equipment and the direction to proceed to unload the vehicle without it, constituted a breach of duty by the defendant to the plaintiff. 24 I find the defendant liable in the primary negligence. ISSUE 2 - CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE25 The particulars of contributory negligence pleaded in the defence were: 
     
      
      1 Failure to use the equipment provided for him. On the evidence there was no such equipment provided. 
      
     
     
      
      2 Failing to remove or empty the drawers of the cabinet before lifting it. As already noted there was no evidence that in determining the weight of the cabinet to be reasonable without removing its contents, the plaintiff acted negligently. 
      
     
     
      
      3 As team leader, failing to ensure that his co-worker had a secure grip on the cabinet and was carrying it in a safe and secure manner. There was evidence that the plaintiff did in fact check with his co-worker on two occasions before the cabinet was dropped. On the first occasion he was assured that the co-worker was managing the lift. The second occasion when he checked was immediately before the cabinet was dropped when there was little he could have done to prevent the accident. 
      
    26 In the circumstances I make no finding of contributory negligence.ISSUE 3 - S 151Z CONTRIBUTION27 The defendant raised by way of defence the issue of negligence of Jobwire and contended that in those circumstances any verdict against it should be reduced in accordance with the provisions of s 151Z of the Workers Compensation Act 1987. The particulars of negligence alleged against Jobwire were, involved the following: 
     
      
      1 Failing to train or instruct the plaintiff appropriately. 
      
     
     
      
      2 Failure to instruct and train the plaintiff’s co-employee appropriately. 
      
     
     
      
      3 Providing a co-employee who was unsuited to heavy lifting work and who should not have been sent for work with the defendant. 
      
     
     
      
      4 Vicarious liability for negligence of the co-worker. 
      
    28 In respect of allegations 2, 3 and 4, there was no evidence that Jobwire employed the co-worker. There was a suggestion without evidence that he was in fact employed by another labour hire company. 29 Ultimately, the proposition of the defendant was that it should have the benefit of the s 151Z provision simply because the plaintiff was not its employee. It was suggested that I should infer that Jobwire did not fulfil its non delegable duty of care as employer of the plaintiff. 30 I was concerned at this approach because it was not particularised and because there was no evidence provided of the arrangements made between the defendant and Jobwire to enable Jobwire to fulfil its obligations to its employees. I appreciate that there are an increasing number of authorities for the proposition that a labour hire company cannot avoid its obligations as an employer by relying upon the parties to whom its employees are allocated. 31 The defendant was unable to identify any authority in which the labour hire company was found liable in circumstances where there was no evidence before the Court of what it did or failed to do about its obligations to its employees. I was referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal in Pollard v Baulderstone Hornibrook Engineering Pty Ltd [2008] NSWCA 99, in which McColl J, with whom Mason P and Beazley JA agreed, analysed many of the existing authorities. None of the authorities to which McColl J referred dealt with the situation where there was no evidence of the labour hire company’s attention or failure to attend to its obligations. There were decisions in which labour hire companies were held not liable in negligence. It is apparent therefore that it is not inevitable that a finding of negligence will be made and that the proportion of that negligence in causing the plaintiff’s damage will be assessed. At [45] McColl J quoted from the decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal in Bourke v Victorian Workcover Authority [1998] VSCA 24, [1999] 1VR 189 at 19 and said that it was accepted that deciding whether the labour hire company’s non delegable duty was discharged, depended upon matters such as the employer’s opportunity to inspect the premises, the length of time the employer has put his employees to work on the premises, the awareness in the employee of the danger, his capacity to shield his employees from the danger and various other factors. 32 In the absence of evidence concerning these factors, I am unable to draw the inference suggested by the defendant that Jobwire failed to discharge its non delegable duty to the plaintiff.33 I find therefore that this element of the defence has not been made out.ISSUE 4 - THE EXTENT OF THE PLAINTIFF’S INJURY AND DISABILITY34 The plaintiff claimed significant injury and disability involving pain in his low back, extending through the backs of his legs to his knees, affecting his left leg to a greater degree than the right. He initially consulted his general practitioner and was treated with anti-inflammatory medication. He was referred to Dr Spittaler, neurosurgeon, when he failed to improve by March 2006, and for pain management to Dr Russo, in June 2006. 35 At the time of his injury the plaintiff was sharing rented accommodation with three other males and sharing housekeeping and cooking duties. He said he was unable to continue to share those duties after his injury. In March 2007 he returned to live at his mother’s home because of financial difficulties and his ongoing inability to perform housework. At that stage he said his pain remained unmanageable. 36 The plaintiff said his condition had not improved to the date of the hearing. He said that he suffered from constant dull pain in his low back with pain into his left leg and that his pain level seriously limited his capacity to undertake activity requiring him to bend, twist, lift, walk, sit, stand, squat and drive. Physiotherapy and hydrotherapy had not assisted him, rather the hydrotherapy had aggravated his pain. He complained of a sitting tolerance limited to ten to fifteen minutes, that he was able to stand still for only two minutes and that it was necessary to take breaks when he was driving. 37 The plaintiff’s pre-accident activities were indoor and outdoor soccer, shooting, water skiing, motor cycle riding and restoring motor vehicles. He said he is no longer able to engage in these activities and that he misses them.38 The plaintiff has not been employed since the accident, although he said he made a considerable number of job applications. 39 In October 2006 the plaintiff undertook an eight week course to secure a certificate in community support services and thus qualify for work with handicapped persons. He said he was unsuited to the work because he was unable to bend, lift or run and therefore to provide adequate supervision. In addition he said he was emotionally unsuited for the work. 40 He agreed that in late 2007 under lump sum contracts he painted the interior and exterior of two houses. In one case he said he did this over a period of twenty to twenty-five days, when prior to the accident he would have completed the work in fourteen days. He said he was delayed by the need to stop to rest and to take occasional days off. He said his back was very sore by the time he completed the job. 41 He also agreed that in recent months he had travelled to Singleton once or twice a week to assist a friend who was building a house. 42 He said he undertakes work that is light and he is not paid for it. The plaintiff said his previous occupations which had involved landscaping, work as a service station console operator and work as a handyman subcontractor, were no longer available to him because they involved the activities that he could no longer undertake. He proposed that he would improve his prospects of future employment by undertaking four years of study, one year to qualify for university entry and three years to undertake degree courses in occupational health and safety and construction management. 43 His mother is currently performing housework on his behalf. He said that if she was not available, he would be unable to undertake heavy housework and mow lawns or hang out washing. He said he would pay for assistance with those household chores if he were funded.44 Treating medical practitioners have not provided treatment that relieved the plaintiff’s symptoms. Dr Russo trialled a number of pain relieving medications and investigative epidural blocks without success. 45 Diagnoses of the plaintiff’s medical advisers were based on an MRI scan taken in April 2006 which disclosed a central disc prolapse at L4-5 with possible left L5 nerve root compression. The question is whether their opinions based as they were upon acceptance of the plaintiff’s complaints and symptoms should be preferred to those of the defendant’s advisers. 46 Dr Sage noted that there were some inconsistencies in the plaintiff’s presentation but he reported that the plaintiff had suffered a significant injury that involved an acute annular tear that was often associated with predictable exacerbations of pain. 47 Dr Buckley gave details of the nature of the plaintiff’s injury and the means by which he was partially recovered. His prognosis was for ongoing pain with the risk of occasional exacerbations and remissions of pain. 48 Dr Cummine who examined the plaintiff on behalf of the Workers Compensation Commission was considerably influenced by the plaintiff’s complaint of pain bilaterally at five degrees of straight leg raising. He said the findings on the MRI did not correlate with the symptoms of which the plaintiff complained and that those findings did not support his observations on clinical examination of the plaintiff. He accepted, however, that the MRI indicated a posterior tear in the annulus at L4-5. 49 Dr Zeeman reported his concerns that on examination there were no clinical signs of organic pathology, nor were there neurological signs, such as weakness or loss of reflex that would ordinarily accompany nerve root compression. His diagnosis was of a disc prolapse at L4-5 without neurological signs. His prognosis was of intermittent but not constant back pain. 50 There was reference in the medical reports to psychological testing that indicated that the plaintiff suffered from a significant degree of depression, anxiety and adjustment difficulties. Medication prescribed by Dr Russo was reported to have assisted. Although the statement of particulars claimed the development of a condition of anxiety and depression, no evidence was put forward to support any ongoing condition of that nature and I have not further considered it.51 In deciding that the opinions of Dr Cummine and Dr Zeeman are to be preferred, I have taken account of the following: 
     
      
      1 The reported inconsistencies in the plaintiff’s presentation at medical examination. 
      
     
     
      
      2 The inconsistencies between the plaintiff’s complaints to the medical advisers and his evidence to the Court concerning his physical restrictions resulting from his injury an his physical capacity as demonstrated in the photographs, exhibits 4 and 5, and recorded on the DVD, exhibit 10. The photographs and the DVD portrayed the plaintiff climbing a ladder, lifting an aluminium bench overhead with one arm, lifting various other items, lifting his large fishing bag overhead, carrying his fishing bag on his back over his shoulder, fishing from a breakwater comprising a number of rocks and boulders, climbing up and down the rocks and boulders to access his fishing spot, sitting and standing intermittently on the boulders, squatting, before sitting up on a boulder, casting the fishing line using a twisting movement, bending to pick up items from the ground, spending a considerable period of time at an hotel or bar, alternately sitting or standing for considerable periods of time. 
      
     
     
      
      3 The evidence recorded on the DVD was of concern for two reasons. Firstly, it was inconsistent with the plaintiff’s evidence that he was unable to undertake activities such as bending, twisting, lifting, sitting, standing or squatting. Secondly, at no time in the course of the record made on the DVD did the plaintiff in any way appear to suffer from back or leg pain, or to behave in a way protective of a seriously disabling back condition. Rather while undertaking these activities he moved freely and apparently perfectly normally. 
      
     
     
      
      4 There was evidence of the plaintiff’s failure to co-operate with medical and rehabilitation services which the defendant attempted to provide. A W Workwise in October 2006 published a report which noted the cancellation of a number of appointments. The plaintiff was issued with two notices of compliance by the workers compensation insurer. One related to his failure to provide Job Search diaries as required. The second related to his failure to attend scheduled appointments with a nominated physiotherapist without explanation. The physiotherapist reported in February 2007 that the plaintiff had failed to attend seven of fifteen sessions. In addition, he reported that the plaintiff displayed poor motivation to participate in active rehabilitation. He stated that in the sessions that the plaintiff did attend, he had demonstrated good physical capability and had achieved some moderate improvement. The plaintiff denied any memory of failing to attend physiotherapy appointments. 
      
     
     
      
      5 There was evidence of half hearted efforts at obtaining employment. The plaintiff stated that he had made numerous applications for employment in accordance with the requirements of his workers compensation insurer. He produced five undated sample letters of application which appeared from exhibit L, an extract of a Job Search diary, to have been sent in the period 21 to 27 May 2007. In ordinary circumstances I would not share the defendant’s criticism of the plaintiff’s reference to his back injury in those letters of application, provided they truly represented his level of disability. I do not accept that they did. I consider that he included reference to his injury and the restrictions imposed on his activities in order to diminish his prospects of securing employment.  
      
    52 For those reasons I make the following findings: 
     
      
      1 The plaintiff suffered from an injury to the L4-5 vertebrae in the course of his employment with the defendant on 22 December 2005. The injury involved damage to the annulus. 
      
     
     
      
      2 The plaintiff was not a witness of credit. He overstated the extent of his ongoing disability resulting from the injury. This overstatement rendered it difficult to undertake the task of assessment. 
      
     
     
      
      3 Having regard to the unsatisfactory features of the plaintiff’s evidence already identified, in particular the material recorded on the DVD, I reject the plaintiff’s evidence that he was affected by constant back pain. I prefer the opinions of Dr Sage and Dr Zeeman and to some extent Dr Buckley, that the plaintiff recovered to the point where he was no longer in constant pain, but that he remained vulnerable to periods of intermittent rather than constant pain. 
      
    ISSUE 5. ASSESSMENT NON-ECONOMIC LOSS53 The plaintiff is still a young man at the age of twenty-eight. The defendant accepted that a period of one year was a reasonable period within which to expect him to have recovered. However, he remained with weakness in his back and with a requirement that he take care of his back. 54 In those circumstances I have assessed his impairment at 27 per cent of a worst case, allowing him the sum of $44,000 for non-economic loss.Income loss55 The preponderance of medical opinion was that the plaintiff could not return to his employment as a furniture removalist or to work involving heavy labouring and that some level of retraining would be required. There was evidence that there were many occupations available to the plaintiff were he motivated to engage in retraining for alternative employment. The defendant accepted that the plaintiff should be compensated for his full loss agreed to be $609 per week for a period limited to fifty-two weeks after his injury. I reject the defendant’s contention that I should reduce this period to take account of an injury which he suffered in 2006 to his right hand, following which he was incapacitated for twelve weeks. At this time the plaintiff was still recovering from his back injury and could not in any event engage in employment. 56 The plaintiff seeks a past income loss at rates according to his certified level of capacity at various periods since the accident. The amount claimed is $59,487. I have decided that I should allow the full loss of $609 dollars per week for the period of eighteen months to allow the plaintiff twelve months to recover from his injury and six months in order to retrain and secure alternative employment. In my view, notwithstanding his ongoing vulnerability it is reasonable to expect that the plaintiff would return to employment after that period. The amount allowed therefore is 78 weeks at $609, totalling $47,502. Superannuation on past income has been calculated on the basis of 11 per cent of that sum at $5225.22.57 For the future the plaintiff asked that he be compensated for a period of four years at a rate of $639 per week being the estimate of his current income earning capacity, were he to return to work as a removalist. The four year period is based upon his expressed intention to undergo tertiary education, following which he has expectations of an income greater than that which he was receiving at the time of his injury. With respect I do not accept that the defendant is required to compensate him to this level. Opportunities of rehabilitation and retraining offered to him in the past have not been taken up. I do accept that a buffer should be allowed to compensate the plaintiff for the loss of capacity to engage in heavy work and to take account of the probability of lost income in periods of exacerbation of pain. I have allowed the sum of $50,000 inclusive of superannuation to cover this loss. Domestic care 58 The claim for past gratuitous care was not pursued. For the future the plaintiff claimed paid assistance for three hours a week discounted by 30 per cent. This assessment was made by Dr Buckley who based it on the plaintiff’s complaints of ongoing constant pain. The defendant contended that no allowance should be made. Dr Zeeman acknowledged a requirement for one hour a week for heavy aspects of maintenance of a household and garden and I consider this to be a reasonable assessment of the plaintiff’s needs. It is allowed without the 30 per cent discount in the sum of $30,096.Out-of-pocket expenses 59 Expenses for the past are agreed in the sum of $35,036.83. The plaintiff’s claim for compensation against future expenses was again based upon Dr Buckley’s assessment of his needs for general practitioner attendances, medication and physiotherapy. The plaintiff also asked for an amount to cover ten years of gymnasium membership. 60 The defendant contended that I should make no allowance on the basis of the plaintiff’s evidence that he has not consulted any medical practitioner in 2008 and that he no longer takes medication. 61 It was apparent however, that the plaintiff will require medical attention from time to time in the future, although I do not accept that his requirements are at the levels proposed by Dr Buckley.62 I have allowed against this contingency the sum of $5000. 63 As to the gymnasium membership, it is quite possible that the plaintiff does require some physical reconditioning in order to restore him to the level of fitness necessary to return him to work. Opportunities to improve his fitness were made available by the defendant and not taken up by the plaintiff. I consider the defendant has discharged its obligations in this respect and the claim for gymnasium membership is rejected. 64 A Fox v Wood component is allowed in the agreed sum of $4007.29. 65 In summary the awards made are as follows: 
     
      
      Non-economic loss at 27 per cent: $44,000.00 
       
      Past income: $47,502.00 
       
      Superannuation on past income: $5225.22 
       
      Future income loss: $5000.00 
       
      Future care: $30,096.00 
       
      Past out-of-pocket expenses: $35,036.83

   SENTENCE1 Rudy Chandra appears for sentence today on five separate offences. When I sentence him for the first of those, he asks that I take into account a number of other matters on a Form 1. 2 The offender pleaded guilty to each of those offences in the local court and so I will discount the sentence I would otherwise have imposed for each offence by twenty-five percent to reflect the utilitarian value of his pleas of guilty.3 The offender has committed a number of various forms of what could loosely be called fraud. He says that he did this because he was in debt due to his gambling. It is as well to state some fundamental principles. Gambling is an addiction and people do act less than rationally at times because of that addiction, but this is not to ignore that gamblers have a choice when they run out of their own money. They can either recognise that fact, or they can attempt to obtain money through other means, most usually, illegal means.4 That is what the offender did in this case. It is his criminal decision to engage himself in illegal activity which forms the basis of his moral culpability.5 Not only in this case did gambling form the genesis of the offender’s misconduct, but it also, in many ways, provided the means. For example, the offender said and I accept immediately, that at the various casinos can be found people willing to facilitate the commission of criminal activities by those who are in need of further money.6 The offender committed the first of his offences in this way: He owed a man by the name of Sam Assayed about twenty thousand dollars. Mr Assayed approached him and told him that if he wanted to discharge the debt he could do so by providing his own bank account details to Mr Assayed. He did so knowing, of course, that these details would be used to facilitate some form of illegal transaction which must have involved money being fraudulently taken from someone. (The offender may not have known who), and put into his own bank account. 7 In fact what appears to have happened is that Mr Assayed handed those details to a man by the name of Clearwater. He, using his technological skills, accessed a particular bank account and on two occasions (which must have been within minutes or even seconds of each other), withdrew one hundred thousand dollars and put the resulting two hundred thousand dollars into the offender’s bank account, utilising the details that he had provided. Fortunately, the authorities intervened before the money could be withdrawn.8 It might be said that the offender was not the person who actually performed the transaction, and that is true. It might be said that the offender did not know how much money would be withdrawn from the innocent victim’s account when he provided his bank account details, but the offender clearly contemplated an offence of this magnitude because once the money had been transferred into his account, he apparently quite willingly and without complaint, handed over a cheque drawn on his account in the sum of two hundred thousand dollars. This was to be used of course to obtain the money which had been illegally transferred. 9 That is a significant offence. The offender was an accessory before the fact, rather than a principal but it is clearly the case that he contemplated a significant loss to someone through say significant criminal activity.10 In sentencing him for those two offences I will impose concurrent sentences. There was one criminal act in handing over the bank account details and it was up to Mr Clearwater rather than the offender, how many times he used those details. There is one qualification of course and that is that the first of those offences has the Form 1 matter on it and so a longer sentence must be imposed to reflect that circumstance. 11 The next offence concerns an offence of being an accessory after the fact to obtaining a valuable thing by deception. The offender had lent money to another person and had been provided with a Mercedes motor vehicle as security. Despite attempts by the offender to get the money repaid, this did not occur and eventually when registration was due, the man who owed him the money told him to transfer the car to his name. The offender realised that the man who owed him the money was not the legitimate owner of the car but nonetheless, went ahead and kept the car anyway. That car was discovered when he was arrested by police and it was returned, as I understand it, to its rightful owner. The car was valued at some seventy-five thousand dollars. 12 The next two offences involve significant misconduct by the offender himself. On two occasions he falsely filled in credit card applications then went and spent a significant amount of money on those credit cards. In each case a substantial loss was occasioned, eighteen thousand dollars on one offence and almost fourteen thousand dollars on the other. 13 The offender has now taken out a loan and repaid that loss and is in the process of repaying the loan. To do so he works two jobs, one at a cake factory and another stocking shelves for K-Mart. 14 The offender does have a prior criminal history although nothing approaching the criminality displayed in these offences. Some time ago he was found with a false driver’s licence and also there was an offence of goods in custody. The offender came to Australia some years ago and seems to have been an industrious and successful person. He has a family and although his gambling and these offences caused some marital disharmony, as might be expected, he is attempting a reconciliation with his wife and children. As Mr Russell says, he is living with them “on probation.” 15 As well as attempting to reconcile with his wife, the offender is attempting to overcome his problems with gambling. He has been seeing a psychologist and the psychologist realistically reports, it seems, that whilst there is no certainty, the offender is progressing well. 16 Gambling is not a significant matter of mitigation primarily for the reasons I outlined at the beginning of these remarks on sentence. There needs to be a significant component of both general deterrence and personal deterrence in this case. Even those who have a problem with gambling need to understand that when they make the decision to commit criminal offences to further their gambling activities, they will be dealt with appropriately. The offender himself needs to understand the consequences of criminal behaviour, even if that criminal behaviour is related to gambling debts. 17 I should also mention other criminal activity of the offender, for which he is not to be sentenced, because of its interrelationship with the offender’s misconduct. The offender was found with a large amount of United States currency. He explained that this was not his but belonged to his sister-in-law and her husband. They had given him one point six million dollars to invest knowing that he was a successful person in Australia, but rather than investing it all, he had invested a proportion of it and gambled a large amount. The three hundred thousand dollars represented what was leftover. When he was in debt because of his gambling, he chose not to use his sister-in-law’s money but chose to commit activities of the sort I have described earlier. That of course is not terribly relevant, it just means that he committed a different form of criminal offence to that he would have committed if he had stolen his sister-in-law’s money and paid off his gambling debts that way.18 The offender tried to explain some of his offences on the Form 1, in particular the provision of false information when transferring money, this way. He said that he was scared of a home invasion and was worried that people in the bank might understand that he had some money and so he did not provided his legitimate address and name. He also explained, that he was able to obtain false documents easily from people at the casino and he did so, not only so that he could commit the two offences of making false statement with intent, but also in case he needed to commit further offences of that kind in the future. 19 When I look at the entirety of the offences, both those for which the offender is to be specifically sentenced and those appearing on the Form 1, it can be seen that the offender was an industrious criminal. He was prepared to commit a number of different offences in order to obtain money which was not his. There was no suggestion that he would have voluntarily given up his activities, without the intervention of the police. Indeed the fact that he had a number of false documents in his possession, reflected in the Form 1 offences, also demonstrates the offender’s intention to continue his illegal ways if he needed to.20 These offences are very serious. The potential loss to innocent people or innocent corporations is significant. As I said it is a matter of good fortune that the two hundred thousand dollars was not withdrawn and that the car was returned to its rightful owner. It is not a significant matter of mitigation that no loss has been caused. Failure to pay back the money owed to the banks and loss in other ways would have been an aggravating factor.21 The Crown suggests that full time custody is required. Mr Russell suggests that if a custodial sentence is imposed, it should either be suspended or of periodic detention. I can immediately pass over the issue as to whether a suspended sentence should be imposed because of the length of the sentence I have decided to impose. The submission in favour of a sentence of periodic detention is primarily based on the fact that the offender is rehabilitating himself and does work at those two jobs that I have referred to earlier. Periodic detention would have the attractiveness of enabling the offender to remain with his family and work productively. On the other hand, it is a fundamental rule in sentencing, that a sentence needs to reflect the objective gravity of an offender’s conduct and I am satisfied that a sentence of periodic detention would not meet that objective. These were serious offences committed over a significant period of time by an offender who made the personal choice to do what he did. Nothing other than full time custody would be appropriate in the present case. 22 I mentioned the activities of a Mr Clearwater. He was dealt with in the local court and received a sentence of twenty months with a non-parole period of fifteen months for three offences, two of which were related to the offences involving Macquarie Bank for which I am to sentence the offender. The Crown and Mr Russell, and indeed, I share some surprise firstly at the fact that the matter was dealt with in the local court and secondly that the sentence imposed was as lenient as it was. Part of the explanation may be the subjective matters appearing in the pre-sentence report. In any case however, I have taken into account the principles of parity when formulating the appropriate sentence for the matters involving Mr Clearwater and the offender. The offender should not have a justifiable sense of grievance when he compares the sentence he receives with the sentence imposed on Mr Clearwater. 23 I will impose sentences as follows. I am working backwards because of the way that sentences need to be imposed in New South Wales. For the offence of making a false statement with intent, item 5 on the Crown Sentence Summary, I sentence the offender to imprisonment. I set a fixed term of twelve months to date from 28 July 2009, that date has been selected to reflect one week’s pre-sentence custody. 24 For the other offence of making a false statement with intent, item 4 on the Crown Sentence Summary, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for twelve months, fixed term to date from 28 October 2009.25 For the offence of accessory prior to the fact of obtaining a valuable thing by deception, item 3 on the Crown Sentence Summary, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a fixed term of twelve months to date from 28 January 2010.26 For the offence of accessory before the fact to obtain money by deception, item 2 on the Crown Sentence Summary, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment, I set a non-parole period of six months to date from 28 July 2010 and a head sentence of twelve months.27 For the offence of accessory before the fact to obtain money by deception, item 1 on the Crown Sentence Summary, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a six months non-parole period to date from 28 July 2010 and a head sentence of eighteen months. That means that the offender is to be released to parole on 27 January 2011.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Robert Cecil English appears for sentence today after having pleaded guilty, in this Court shortly before his trial was due to commence, to three serious offences. The first is an offence of aggravated take and drive a motor vehicle with a person whilst armed with a weapon. That has a maximum penalty of fourteen years with a standard non-parole period of five years. The second offence is an offence of armed robbery, carrying a maximum penalty of twenty years. Although it is the second on the Crown’s sentence summary it appears to have been committed shortly after the offence which is third on the Crown sentence summary, another offence of armed robbery with a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment. When I sentence him for the second armed robbery on the Crown sentence summary Mr English asks that I take into account a matter on a Form 1, that being an additional offence related to carjacking and aggravated assault with intent to take or drive a motor vehicle. The three offences for which the offender must be specifically sentenced all occurred on the same day, 7 July 2009, whilst the matter on the Form 1 occurred a little while thereafter, 25 August 2009. 2 On 7 July Mr English was under the influence of both Xanax and heroin. His intoxication by those drugs probably had a part to play in his decision to commit the three offences on that day. His ability to think rationally was clearly affected by the drugs that he had taken. He decided that he would commit an offence of armed robbery but he needed to get a getaway car. He therefore waited in the Westfield car park at Hurstville. At about 4.20 that day a woman drove into the car park and parked her car. The offender approached the driver. He placed a knife to her stomach, told her to give him the car keys and her handbag. Not surprisingly the victim did as she was told. Mr English then got into her car and drove away. The victim’s handbag, which was in the car, contained about $180 in cash and various other personal items. 3 A little while thereafter Mr English committed the first of his armed robbery offences that day. He went to a convenience store whilst armed with a knife. He approached the counter and produced the knife. He leant over the counter and grabbed the victim by his jacket collar. He pointed the knife towards the victim’s abdomen and said, “Open the till or I’ll stab you.” The victim complied because he was afraid. He said, “Okay, calm down, don’t stab me.” He opened the cash register. The offender took the cash tray containing $200 in cash and ran out to the vehicle which he had earlier taken at the Westfield car park at Hurstville. That was at about 5.50pm.4 Shortly before, in fact 5.45pm, he had gone to a mixed business at Peakhurst. There was a female shop attendant there. The offender produced a knife and ran behind the counter. The shop attendant tried to stop him from entering the counter area but he simply pointed the knife at her chest so she moved aside. He wanted the contents of the till, so the offender took a key trying to open the till. When that was not successful he reached underneath the counter where a change box was kept. At this stage the attendant tried to get away but Mr English chased her, grabbed the left sleeve of her shirt and a struggle ensued. During this struggle the knife fell to the floor and the shop attendant attempted to kick the knife away. A further struggle ensued, during which she was knocked to the ground. She managed to kick the knife under a shelf and began to scream. They continued to struggle for about forty seconds. Eventually the offender managed to retrieve the knife and ran out of the shop. He got into the motor vehicle that I have spoken about and drove away. It seems that he was identified when he pawned a mobile telephone that he had taken during the carjacking offence. 5 The Form 1 matter occurred on 25 August 2009. As Mr Priddis, who appeared for the offender, suggested, it was probably going to be the precursor to other offences of the type that I have just described. On this occasion the victim drove her car into a council car park. She turned off the engine and waited in the driver’s seat for her husband. She became aware that Mr English was at the driver’s door. He told her, “Get out of the fucking car.” The victim saw that the offender had a Stanley knife in his hand. She grabbed her handbag but the offender presented the knife to her, holding it about thirty centimetres away from her face. He said after she began screaming, “Stop fucking screaming.” He pulled her out of the car and she fell onto the ground. However he couldn’t start the car. Probably because of the adrenalin that was flowing through her body at the time, the victim yelled at Mr English saying, “Get out of my fucking car”, and probably because he was unable to start the car and because of the fuss that was being made, Mr English ran away. He had been observed getting into another car which was registered to him. He was therefore arrested and searched. 6 These are of course very serious offences. On each occasion the offender was armed with a knife with which he threatened an innocent person. Each of the victims of these offences were greatly concerned for their personal safety and no doubt that factor is an important one which the legislature has taken into account in setting significant terms of imprisonment. The prevalence of armed robbery is also one of the factors that led to the Court of Criminal Appeal issuing a guideline judgment for those offences. It is obvious that significant sentences need to be imposed to reflect the objective gravity of what the offender has done to personally deter him from committing further offences of this kind in the future (and I note in this respect that he has a criminal history involving other offences of armed robbery) and to deter others who might be tempted to commit offences of this type. 7 The offender is now thirty years of age. He was born and raised in Sydney. He grew up in a household where both his parents abused alcohol and assaulted each other when they were drunk. His parents would separate, reunite and then separate fairly regularly. The offender left home at the comparatively late age of twenty-seven years. He is in a de facto relationship, with a young child being born of that partnership. His partner has recently been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. She lives in Queensland. The offender left school at thirteen after being expelled for truancy, smoking cannabis and generally acting in an antisocial way. Despite having left school then, the psychological report suggests that he has above average intelligence. He gave evidence before me today and impressed as an articulate and clever person, who, if he chooses to do so, has much to contribute. He has been employed on a number of occasions, most recently working for a waste removal company. 8 He was released from custody for armed robbery matters in December 2007 and completed his period on parole satisfactorily. However matters went downhill in his work and personal life, such that he began reusing drugs. His offending on this occasion was related to his drug use, not only as I have described, because he was under the influence of drugs at the time, but also because his desire to obtain more drugs was what motivated his offending. 9 He was arrested on 28 August 2009 but has served a fixed term of six months for a break, enter and steal matter, which means that his time in custody solely referrable to the matters for which I must sentence him, dates from 24 February 2010. I will commence the sentences that I am going to impose upon him from that date, taking into account that these sentences will be served accumulatively on that six months sentence. The offender was on bail at the time of these offences, which is a seriously aggravating factor. Because the carjacking offence carries with it a standard non-parole period, I am required to assess whether it falls within the middle of the range of objective seriousness of offences of that type. I make that finding, noting that what I am looking at is not a single point but a range. I am satisfied that as I have described it, the offence does fall within that range. 10 It was, I regret to say, an unremarkable offence of carjacking. I regret to say that because offences of this type are becoming, it would seem, more common. As vehicle security increases it is harder to steal one and so offenders like Mr English obtain their getaway cars by carjacking instead. Increasing prevalence of this offence is no doubt one matter which has led to it being one of the comparatively small number of offences that do carry standard non-parole periods. The standard non-parole period is not of direct application in this case because of the offender’s plea of guilty. That was a late plea but I will discount the sentence that I would otherwise have imposed by ten per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of that plea. 11 I mentioned before the Henry guideline judgment, that proposes a sentence of four to five years for an offence of the type postulated by the Court of Criminal Appeal in that judgment. The offender’s conduct on each occasion was broadly within that typical case postulated by the Court of Criminal Appeal with one exception, he is not a young offender with little or no criminal history. He is thirty years of age with an extensive criminal history, including, as I have mentioned now on a couple of occasions, prior offences of armed robbery. The offender expressed his remorse, not only in the psychiatric report but also in his evidence today. I accept that remorse is genuine. That of course will play an important part in the offender rehabilitating himself, in that he genuinely accepts that he has done the wrong thing and deserves to be punished. 12 I cannot say however that there are good prospects of rehabilitation or that he is unlikely to re-offend. There is hope for the future but much will depend on how Mr English deals with the stresses of everyday life upon his release from custody and in particular whether he resorts to drug use as he did on this occasion. He will need an extended period of supervision on parole in order to provide him with the best chance of overcoming his drug problem. Not only will that be of benefit to him, but it will also be of benefit to the community. The findings I have made of special circumstances has led to a comparatively modest adjustment because the non-parole periods that I will eventually announce are the least which I consider appropriate to reflect the objective gravity of the offender’s conduct. Special circumstances exist also because the sentences are accumulative partially, that is on each other, and totally accumulative on the six months sentence for break, enter and steal. It is true that these three offences for which I must specifically sentence the offender all occurred within a relatively short space of time, but they do represent serious, significant, separate acts of criminality. For that reason it would be inappropriate to impose sentences which are totally concurrent with each other but I take into account the principle of totality and will impose sentences which are partially accumulative on each other. 13 The third of the armed robbery offences on the Crown’s sentencing summary is objectively worse than the second, but the second has the Form 1 attached to it. Notwithstanding their different circumstances, I will impose identical non-parole periods on the two armed robbery offences. The more serious objective gravity of the third armed robbery offence on the Crown sentencing summary means that the overall sentence is slightly longer than the second. The sentences I am about to impose are lengthy but they are a product of a number of important matters, not the least of which is the standard non-parole period attached to one of them. It also has to be emphasised that the offender has caused a great deal of harm to society and its members through his continuing criminal behaviour. The sentences I will now announce therefore are the least which I consider are appropriate in the circumstances.14 For the offence of carjacking, described as offence 1 on the Crown sentence summary, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of three years to date from 24 February 2010 and a head sentence of five years on that matter.15 For the offence described as offence 2 on the Crown sentence summary, taking into account the From 1 matter, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a fixed term of two years to date from 24 February 2012. For the offence described as offence 3 on the Crown sentence summary, the offender is sentence to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of two years to commence from 24 February 2013 and a head sentence of four and a half years. 16 The overall term is thus a non-parole period of five years, which will expire on 23 February 2015, on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole and a total overall term of seven and a half years.

   JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: Henry Sandoval stood trial before me charged on an indictment which alleged four offences; two in the alternative to the other two. 2 Counts 1 and 3 were dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm, whilst at the time driving to escape pursuit by a police officer. Counts 2 and 4, in the alternative to counts 1 and 3, were the un-aggravated form of the offence, namely dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm. 3 I acquitted Mr Sandoval of counts 1 and 3 for reasons I gave at the time and found him not guilty on the grounds of mental illness in relation to counts 2 and 4. Attention then turned to consequential orders because the parties were not in a position to produce evidence that day as to the form of any orders I should make. Despite some concern as to whether I had the power to do so, I granted Mr Sandoval bail until today.4 This morning evidence was called from his treating psychiatrist, Dr Yenson, he also gave oral evidence, and, with his assistance, Ms Davis who appears for Mr Sandoval, and the Crown formulated a draft set of orders which they considered it appropriate to make. I have received those orders and, apart from a few minor changes, will be making those in a short time.5 Ultimately, the decision I have to make at this stage is what to do with Mr Sandoval. Previously I had no alternative but to require that he be detained in custody. However, relatively recent amendments to the Mental Health Forensic Provisions Act now allow me to order Mr Sandoval’s release from custody, either unconditionally or subject to conditions. However, there is a very important restraint. I am not to make an order for his release unless I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the safety of Mr Sandoval or any other member of the public will not be seriously endangered by his release. That is not a matter which, of course, should be dealt with lightly. After all, Mr Sandoval’s conduct on 29 May 2009 led to grievous bodily harm to innocent road users and I have to be careful to ensure, as far as I can, that such or similar conduct will not be repeated. At the time Mr Sandoval was receiving oral medication for his schizophrenia, but was less than one hundred per cent compliant. There were other stressors in his life as well. Now it appears that there has been a change in the way he is treated, in particular he receives anti-psychotic medication injected every three weeks, and this has assisted in him complying with his oral medication which he takes daily. 6 He has also, since 29 May 2009, abstained from consumption of illicit drugs and alcohol and, possibly because of the two matters I have just mentioned, developed a higher level of insight. He now informs the Mental Health Service treating him when he is hearing voices, and now appreciates more than he did back in May 2009, the need for him to comply with his medication requirement. Dr Yenson said that if his treatment remains as it is at present, then the risk of offending of the type which occurred last year would be low.7 I am satisfied, therefore, that as matters presently stand, and if his treatment continues the way it is, then on the balance of probabilities the safety of Mr Sandoval and the safety of any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by his release; subject to the conditions which I will now read out.8 Mr Sandoval is to be released from custody subject to the following conditions. (1) He comply with any directions given to him by Dr Sean Yenson, or by any other psychiatrist, and he is to be supervised by Macarthur Mental Health Service to ensure his compliance. (2) He comply with all directions given by any alcohol and drug counsellor, including that he submit to testing to ensure compliance with condition 3. (3) He is not to consume any alcohol or illicit drugs at all. (4) He attend for his three weekly injections of the anti-psychotic medication Zucioponthixol Deconate 50 milligrams depot injection anti-psychotic medication or such other depot injection as may be prescribed. (5) He takes all medications, oral and otherwise, as prescribed by his treating psychiatrist, in particular where medication is prescribed to be taken daily he is to take that medication everyday. (6) He accept directions and counselling from his Caseworker, Manager and Psychiatrist. (7) He is to be of good behaviour. (8) He is to advise the registrars of this Court and of the Mental Health Review Tribunal of his current address and telephone number, and he is to notify them immediately in writing in the event of any plans to change address and/or telephone number, and any change of address and telephone numbers. (9) He attend the Mental Health Review Tribunal as required by the Tribunal.

   Judgment1. At 2.30pm today, on the first day of hearing I received an application on behalf of the defendant to issue a warrant pursuant to s.194 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). 2. Section 194(1) provides that: 
     
      
     “(1) If a witness fails to appear when called in any civil or criminal proceedings and it is proved that he or she has been duly bound by recognisance or served with a summons or subpoena, the court may:  
     
     
      
      (a) order the witness to show cause at those or later proceedings why execution of the recognisance or an attachment for disobedience to the summons or subpoena should not be issued against the witness, or  
      
     
     
      
      (b) if it is proved that the non-appearance is without just cause or reasonable excuse and that the witness will probably be able to give relevant evidence in the proceeding, issue a warrant to bring the witness before the court to give the evidence.” 
      
    3. The history in this matter is set out in two affidavits. I should indicate that the first affidavit of 26 February was read at my request. I do not say that in any way critical of counsel for the defendant, who has behaved in a perfectly proper way throughout this application but because it is appropriate that I should note that it is being read, because I have asked it to be read and because I am of the view that the information in there is relevant. It was my view, having a look at the affidavit of Mr Oag, sworn on 25 June 2007 (which just attaches the affidavit of service and refers to a telephone call to the plaintiff's place of employment on 22 June and a letter sent on 20 June) would signally fail to comply with the requirement of showing it was “without just cause or reasonable excuse”. There is rather more in the affidavit of Mr Mander-Jones of 26 February 2007, but even that falls short.4. I will now set out the matters upon which the evidence in question would be given by Mr Parker.5. Mr Parker was a security guard at the Target store. It is alleged by the plaintiff in her statement of claim filed on 27 July 2006 that on 30 August 2005 his conduct gave rise to actions for wrongful arrest, false imprisonment, assault and defamation.6. The plaintiff has given evidence and been cross-examined, as has her sister, who was present for part of the events in question. I am therefore in a good position to understand what the evidence of Mr Parker is intended to be since Mr Parker's version of events has been put to them. 7. Essentially what is involved is that Mr Parker stopped the plaintiff at some position on either before or just outside the Target store; the precise location is in dispute. Allegations were made about the theft of razor blades from the store's shelf and again the precise nature and substance of these is, again, the subject of dispute. Mr Mander-Jones says in his affidavit of 26 February 2007 in paragraph 6, and I must say I concur, that the evidence of Mr Parker is crucial to the defence of the defendant's claim, and that he is a material witness.8. This matter first came before the court, and was set down for hearing as a s.7A jury trial before a judge sitting alone, on Monday 26 February 2007. On that day the trial could not proceed for a number of reasons, and an application was made by the defendant for an adjournment due to the unavailability of its principal witness for, according to my order “asserted medical reasons”. I ordered the defendant to pay the plantiff's costs for the vacating of the hearing date on an indemnity basis, probably because the application was brought so late.9. The affidavit that was before me on that day was the affidavit of Mr Mander-Jones. It set out that Mr Parker was located at a residential address and he asked the investigator, Mr Whitehead, if Mr Parker was willing to be interviewed in relation to the incident. Mr Whitehead said, “No, I think you will have to subpoena him”. Then Mr Barko, who is the counsel in the matter, had a conversation about service of a subpoena and it would appear that for whatever reason Mr Parker was not subpoenaed for the 26 February hearing date. On 22 February Mr Mander-Jones telephoned Busby Fire Station and asked to speak to Mr Parker, who was working there as a fireman. He was informed that Mr Parker was not working that day. He then had a conversation with Mr Barko who said he had been contacted by Mr Shaun Titmarsh, the solicitor for Mr Parker's family. He stated that Mr Parker was unwell and under the care of a psychologist and that Mr Parker was seeing a psychologist on the day of the hearing, namely, 26 February 2007.10. Mr Titmarsh said in a conversation with Mr Mander-Jones “Geoffrey Parker is very unwell and under the care of a psychologist”. He is unable to attend the hearing as he is not well and he has a consultation with the psychologist on 26 February 2007. Mr Titmarsh said, in my view quite properly, that he did not have instructions to release the name of the psychologist and he would not give it.11. The hearing was adjourned and then on 26 March 2007, about a month later, a process server served Mr Parker with a subpoena to give evidence and a copy of the affidavit of service is annexure B to the affidavit of Mr Oag of 25 June 2007. It would seem, as I understand it, that there was further communication between Mr Parker and the solicitors for the defendant either between 26 February 2007 and 26 March 2007 when the subpoena was served, and between 26 March and 20 June 2007. On 20 June Mr Oag deposes to having sent letters to all subpoenaed witnesses, and one of them was a letter sent by express post on 20 June notifying Mr Parker that he would be required to attend court on the first day of the hearing and also to attend a conference in Mr Barko's chambers on Monday 25 June 2007 at 9:00am. I gather that he did not show up; in fact I think it is quite obvious he did not show up. When the hearing commenced Mr Parker was called outside the court three times and he did not appear.12. On 22 June, according to the affidavit of Mr Oag, he telephoned Mr Parker's place of employment, Busby Fire Station. He was informed that Mr Parker was not present. He then rang his mobile telephone number which rang out. He then arranged for a firm of investigation agents by following, further attempts to contact him by telephone having failed. He was informed on 25 June 2007 by his agent that they were unable to contact Mr Parker over the course of the weekend. I could not help noticing in the earlier affidavit that there was a statement made to the process servers by the neighbours to the process servers that the witness was “a fireman and was away for days on end” and that the neighbour was unable to advise when he would be returning. The process servers were able to speak to him on his mobile and Mr Parker told the process servers he was presently doing something, but unfortunately that word has been omitted from the letter, and said he might be doing a shift late on Friday night and that he would contact the agent to arrange a time for service.13. What information do I have as to Mr Parker without just cause or reasonable excuse not coming to court? True it is that he has been served with a subpoena. Many witnesses are served with subpoenas and do not necessarily appreciate what I could call the fine print. If it was the case that everybody who was issued with a subpoena could then be arrested by the police pursuant to s.194 and brought before this court in circumstances where almost certainly if that warrant was issued tonight he or she would spend the night in gaol it would be regrettable.14. I was not taken to any authority on the issue. Mr Barko submits, and I accept having regard to the comments by Stephen Odgers in Uniform Evidence Law (7th ed, 2006 at 800 footnote 29) concerning the question of whether satisfaction needs to be established beyond reasonable doubt or on the balance of probabilities, that it is preferable that it should be done on the balance of probabilities. I note, however, that this is a question which Hodgson CJ in Eq in Harris/D-E Pty Limited v McClelland’s Coffee and Tea Pty Limited (1999) 149 FLR 204 at [34] “left aside” so it is an issue which is not entirely free from doubt. In any event the provisions of s.142 make it clear that I should have regard to what is often called the Briginshaw test (Briginshaw v Briginshaw (1938) 60 CLR 336). I should be slow to come to the conclusion that a person has not complied with the subpoena for the first time, in circumstances where there has been no prior communication for some months. There are other possibilities, such as he has forgotten it, or he has gone away or he has been involved in rescue activities following the recent very severe weather conditions in Sydney. I should not assume that his non appearance is without just cause or reasonable excuse. 15. The test in Briginshaw has occasionally fallen to be considered in civil proceedings in a defamation context. I note it was considered to be the appropriate test in Marsden v Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd [2001] NSWSC 510 in relation to proof of truth of criminal matters in civil proceedings. I note also also that in McKenzie v Mergen Holdings Pty Ltd (1990) 20 NSWLR 42 Mahoney JA suggested that it might be an appropriate test in relation to findings of malice. I apply the same test of caution here.16. The circumstances in which this court would issue a subpoena to a witness for failing to attend proceedings would have to be extreme. It was put to me that everything that could be done had been done. However, in my view a number of things could have been done. First of all, a letter could, and perhaps should, have been written a lot earlier than 20 June and it should have pointed out the consequences of failure to comply, if only because sometimes people do not appreciate these things unless they are spelled out quite clearly. Secondly, a conversation could have been had with the commander of the Busby Fire Station. I note that a conversation was in fact had, but very late in the piece, in circumstances where the commander apparently said that Mr Parker was expected in for work on Friday, and it seems that he did not come. 17. All I know about Mr Parker is that he is a man who had quite serious health problems which prevented his attending this court on 26 February. It would appear that he has a family solicitor but it is uncertain whether Mr Titmarsh has in fact been able to communicate with him. Even if he had, it would be difficult to know what precisely has been said bearing in mind the mantle of legal professional privilege, though I note in this regard the recent High Court decision about the degree to which legal professional privilege can be used as a cloak in proceedings for contempt, and I express no concluded view as to whether or not this would be an excuse. 18. It seems to me that there are other explanations, and that the defendant cannot be said to have left no stone unturned to follow up on this witness. As I understand it, Mr Parker was requiring a subpoena on the previous occasion, which is to be expected from someone who is a fireman and who would need a subpoena to come to court. There is no actual statement from him to the effect that he will never give evidence or some other foreshadowing of a contumelious disregard for his obligations as a witness and the like. 19. Accordingly, I am of the view that the defendant has not made out a case for the issuing of a warrant, however, I note that it is now 3.15pm and we are about to adjourn since we have run out of witnesses and it may be that further evidence can be put before me tomorrow at 10:00am. However, that is a matter for the defendant. I should indicate that it would need to be compelling evidence before I would consider the issuing of a warrant for a member of the community who has no prior history of failure to comply and whose previous non-attendance was explained on the basis of ill-health.Orders1. Application by defendant to issue a warrant pursuant to s.194 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) refused.

   1. This is a short note setting out the reasons why I have placed these proceedings in the Not Ready List with a review date in three months time, this being the time suggested by the parties, namely 20 June 2008. 
    2. These proceedings were commenced in 2001. There have been two trips to the Court of Appeal. The first was an appeal from a s 7A ruling by Judge Cooper: Wagstaff v Keramianakis [2006] NSWCA 137. The second appeal, from s 7A Jury findings in a trial before Judge Puckeridge, was heard by the Court of Appeal on 12 September 2007. On 21 December 2007 the Court handed down its judgment (Keramianakis v Regional Publishers Pty Ltd [2007] NSWCA 375) dismissing the appeal (by majority). An application for leave to appeal to the High Court has been lodged.3. The Court of Appeal held (see [6]ff in the headnote) that although the Court would otherwise have allowed the appeal it did not have power to do so, in that: 
     
     “The right of appeal was never available in relation to a jury verdict in the District Court, but only from the ruling, order, direction or decision of a judge in point of law or upon a question of evidence. As a result of the history of amendments to the  
     Supreme Court Act 
      1970, there is no provision empowering this Court to make orders on an appeal arising from proceedings in the District Court involving a trial with a jury: [87] 
      
      
     ... 
      
      
     A judgment entered on the basis of a jury verdict does not naturally fall within the present language of s 127 of the  
     District Court Act 
     : [88]. A challenge to a jury verdict is available by application for a new trial, prior to the entry of judgment, pursuant to s 126 of the  
     District Court Act 
      1973. Where this procedure is not taken, there is no power in this Court to hear an appeal against a judgment or order entered on the basis of a jury’s verdict as being “a decision of a Judge”: [94].

    4. I have already placed another matter in the Not Ready List by reason of this judgment. I am setting out these comments for case management purposes, because it is likely that there will be more such cases. It is appropriate that I record the case management problems this gives rise to for the benefit of not only the litigants in these proceedings and the Court registry, but also for other litigants who may find themselves in this position.5. Although the Court of Appeal in Keramianakis stated that no appeals heard by the Court of Appeal since 1995 in defamation proceedings, there have been several. In both Zarth v Williamson [2006] NSWCA 246 and Trantum v McDowell [2005] NSWCA 138 the Court of Appeal heard challenges to jury findings on publication which is, as Bryson JA noted in Zarth, a jury issue. In Jones v Sutton (2004) 61 NSWLR 614 the Court of Appeal (at [75] – [77]) heard and dismissed an appeal that the imputations found by the jury were perverse. In the first Keramianakis appeal ([2006] NSWCA 137), the Court of Appeal (at [36]) held the parties could appeal from “any” interlocutory order, including a s 7A jury trial finding, citing Gerlach v Clifton Bricks Pty Ltd (2002) 209 CLR 478.6. While there are, as the Court of Appeal noted in the second Keramianakis appeal, only a few defamation jury appeals from this Court to the Court of Appeal, there have been many appeals from jury verdicts in personal injury cases. Since 1995 the Court of Appeal and High Court have heard and determined appeals from jury verdicts in many personal injury actions: State of New South Wales v Moss (2000) 54 NSWLR 536; Glover Gibbs Pty Ltd t/as Balfours NSW Pty Ltd v Laybutt [2004] NSWCA 45 (overturned by the High Court [2005] HCA 56); State Forests of NSW v Dinnerville [2004] NSWCA 127; Ross v WGE Pty Ltd (1998) 44 NSWLR 510 to name but a few. The District Court refers to these decisions on a daily basis, particularly State of New South Wales v Moss. 7. The Court of Appeal has in fact set aside judgments of the District Court judges when they have dispensed with juries in Combined Excavations & Supplies Pty Ltd v Bowis [2000] NSWCA 298; Clifton Bricks Pty Ltd v Gerlach [2000] NSWCA 90 (affirmed in the High Court); Dubbo Stock & Station Agents Pty Ltd v Laws [2004] NSWCA 336. (Appeals were dismissed in Department of Community Services v Dezery [2000] NSWCA 196 and Itek Graphix Pty Ltd v Elliott (2002) 54 NSWLR 207). These Court of Appeal decisions referred to the benefits of a jury trial, but not to its limitations. 8. The High Court in Fox v Percy (2003) 214 CLR 118 at [21] described the appeal process from District Court verdicts generally, without stating that this right was limited to non-jury judgments; this passage is referred to with approval by the Court of Appeal in Echo Publications Pty Ltd v Tucker [2007] NSWCA 73, a defamation appeal from the Supreme Court.9. The Court of Appeal has heard appeals from District Court jury verdicts where a s 126 application was made on the day of the trial. Those decisions do not suggest that s 126 is the sole right of appeal. In particular, in Costains (Australia) Pty Ltd v Atkinson (New South Wales Court of Appeal, 5 October 1995, unreported), the Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal from an order for a new trial made by Judge Bell under s 126. As is the case with so many jury verdicts, it was handed down at 5.17pm at night, so the application was not made until the following day, which is normally fatal to such an application. Indeed Kirby P noted with relief (at page 2 of his Honour’s judgment) that this point had not been taken, presumably as everybody took the view that possibly following what his Honour called the “surprise” of the verdict, an application could perhaps have been made on the day and just not noted by the Court. The facts of Costains paint a stark picture of the kind of injustice that would occur if an application under s 126 on the day of the trial was in fact the only right of appeal available.10. In Costains, Kirby P described the approach to be taken in a s 126 application as “similar to that taken by this Court hearing and disposing of an appeal based on the same grounds”, referring at p 2 to the appeal procedure, which seems at variance with a ruling that there is no such right of appeal.11. The Court of Appeal set aside a judgment of myself in a case Sonda v Signorelli [2004] NSWCA 134, where, following an application under s 126, I set aside a jury verdict as perverse. The Court extensively reviewed s 126 in its judgment but there was no suggestion it was the only right of appeal. Sonda is not cited in Keramianakis.12. I have set these cases out to show how unexpected the Court of Appeal’s judgment was, to legislators and litigators alike. 13. It is unclear what the implications of the Court of Appeal's judgment will be for jury trials in this Court. It will be necessary for parties who are applying for juries to hear their actions under both Acts to take this apparent very serious gap in the District Court Act 1973 (NSW) into account. It may be that it will lead to an increase in applications to dispense with jury trials under s 21 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) because of the hardship caused by having a right of appeal that would be limited to hours of minutes following down the handing down a jury verdict, perhaps late in the day.14. If the purpose of the Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) was to make juries available for all defamation actions, that purpose has been substantially undermined. In the interim, pending resolution in the High Court, these proceedings will join other proceedings with the same problem in the Not Ready list, pending either a favourable resolution in the High Court, or statutory amendment, or perhaps both.15. I grant the parties leave to apply at any time for such further orders as are necessary.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Ricky Halatoa appears for sentence today after having pleaded guilty at an early stage to two offences, both committed at around the same time on 21 January 2010. Mr Halatoa had only recently been released from custody when he committed these two serious offences.2 He and a friend were out one evening. They went past a boarding house in Redfern, they noticed that one of the windows was open. They therefore went into the boarding house and went to the second storey, where they entered a bedroom shared by two men, who from the nature of the property stolen appear to have been tourists. The offender and his accomplice then stole a significant amount of property, some of it quite valuable, from the premises. Fortunately the acts of taking the property disturbed one of the men sleeping. He saw two silhouettes leaving his bedroom, got up and realised what was happening. The police were, therefore, called.3 A little while later the police, presumably attending in response to the telephone call, saw the offender and two others walking along the road. They saw that the offender was carrying property consistent with the description of property stolen, as was another of the people there. That person was arrested. The backpack in his possession was later shown to have been taken from the premises. However, the offender tried to get away. He jumped over a fence before running through a construction site. Eventually the offender reached a fence which was quite high. He tried to climb over the fence, but a police officer pulled him down. Rather than recognising that he had been arrested and giving up, the offender then acted very violently towards the police officer who was trying to arrest him. He firstly grabbed the officer in a headlock and then kicked and punched him several times. In an effort to defend himself the officer drew his extendable baton and struck the accused several times to the left arm. Again, rather than giving up, the offender responded violently. He took control of the baton and used it to hit the police officer hard to the back of his head causing him immediate pain, dizziness and for him to become disoriented. Eventually the officer, fearing that he was going to be overpowered, let go of the baton, pushed the accused away and drew his firearm. It was at this belated stage that the offender gave up. He was then arrested and taken to the police station. He was searched later on and property that had been taken from the premises earlier on was discovered on him. 4 The officer fortunately does not appear to have been significantly physically injured. He was treated for bruising and abrasions by an ambulance officer and was told that he should apply ice to the bruising to his head.5 As I mentioned, the offender had only been released from custody a fortnight prior, three weeks in fact. That was for an offence of break and enter a dwelling house with intent to steal, an offence remarkably similar to one of those to which I must sentence the offender today. In addition he was on probation for an offence of break, enter and steal, that probation being imposed upon him by the Children’s Court in March 2009. Although he was over eighteen at the time, the offence was committed when he was younger. That explains why he was both on probation from a Children’s Court and on parole in relation to a sentence imposed at Blacktown Local Court at the time he committed these offences. Upon his being returned to custody his parole was revoked. Thus, from 21 January 2010, the date of his arrest, until the expiry of his sentence, sometime later, 30 April 2010, he was both bail refused on these matters and serving the balance of parole.6 That led to a dispute between the Crown and Mr Rajan, who appeared for the offender, as to the date on which the sentences I impose for these matters should commence. I will sentence him to date from 21 January 2010, recognising that it was the commission of these offences which led to parole being revoked, and that I will be taking into account in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed, the fact that he was on parole and probation at the time of these offences.7 The offender is still a relatively young man, twenty years of age. His upbringing was less than ideal. His mother abused alcohol and she and his father were regular perpetrators of domestic violence against each other. His father would serve periods of custody, usually for domestic violence matters, which led to significant financial strain within the family. In order to feed themselves members of the family believed it was necessary for them to commit offences. Thus, for the offender as he grew up crime was a way of life and even perceived as essential. Alcohol and violence were particular features of his upbringing. Things have improved of recent times as his mother deals with her issues regarding alcohol. 8 The offender left school before completing year ten and although he has been employed for brief periods from time to time, he has largely been unemployed, receiving benefits from Centrelink on occasions. 9 He has been involved in a relationship with his partner. They have two children. But despite his partner having visited him regularly in custody, those visits have ceased. The offender believes that this may be because his partner too has now been arrested for some offending. 10 The offender told a psychologist who wrote a report for the benefit of the Court about his drug and alcohol history. He is a significant consumer of illegal drugs and alcohol. Not surprisingly these have led to problems with his behaviour, including a tendency to lose his temper easily, paranoia, hyper vigilance, and other common and distressing features of substance abuse. On being released from custody shortly before the commission of these offences the offender began abusing cocaine, ecstasy, heroin and alcohol. He was under the influence of these drugs at the time of these offences.11 As Mr Rajan noted the prospects of the offender’s rehabilitation are guarded. He has for a young man a fairly entrenched antisocial lifestyle. He reports regular violence, for example, as well as substance abuse I referred to earlier. It is of course obvious that the offender needs to be punished for what he has done by a significant term of imprisonment. However, there is also the need to ensure, as far as possible, that the offender is offered the opportunity to rehabilitate himself. For those reasons I will be making a finding of special circumstances in the offender’s favour and making a recommendation that he be released on parole consistent with the matter referred to in the psychologist’s report. 12 The offence of assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty, thereby causing actual bodily harm, carries with it a standard non-parole period of three years. That standard non-parole period is not of direct application because of the early pleas of guilty but it remains as an important guidepost to the sentence that I should impose on him for that offence.13 I am required to assess whereabouts in the range of offending this particular offence falls. I am satisfied that it is in the middle of the range of objective seriousness of offences of this type. I take into account that the physical injuries suffered by the police officer are relatively minor, consisting of bruising and abrasions. Much more serious injuries are encompassed by the description actual bodily harm. On the other hand I take into account that the offender used a weapon. He may not have brought the weapon to the scene and only used it once it was produced by the police officer, but once he got his hands on it he used it by striking the police officer to the back of his head. Also important in assessing the objective gravity of this offence is the fact that this was not a single blow, as if often the case, but was sustained violence, beginning with a headlock, continuing with punching and kicking and ending with the use of a weapon, the police officer’s expandable baton. For those reasons I find, as I have said, the objective gravity of the assault police officer in the execution of his duty and cause actual bodily harm offence, is in the middle of the range of objective seriousness of offences of this type.14 These were opportunistic offences in one sense. The offender and his accomplice, or accomplices, saw the open window and took advantage of the opportunity that that presented. He did not go out that evening intending to assault a police officer, doing so only in an effort to get away after having committed the first of his offences. In spite of the circumstances, these offences are very serious. What is a person supposed to do on a summer’s night in Sydney? Put bars over every window, sleep with the window shut? It has to be recognised that when people do take advantage of the opportunity that open windows present to commit an offence such as the one I have described of aggravated enter dwelling with intent, in circumstances where they well knew that people were asleep inside, a significant sentence is imposed. Further, assaults on police officers doing their duty to reduce crime and bring offenders to justice, must also be met with significant sentences. It is largely a thankless task that police officers perform, but it is an essential one and the courts need to do what they can to deter others that may be tempted to assault police officers, particularly when they are being arrested for another offence. For those reasons, despite the offender’s youth, despite the offender’s background, significant sentences of imprisonment are required. I will reduce the sentences I would have otherwise imposed by twenty-five per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of the offender’s early pleas of guilty.15 The sentences I impose are as follows. For the offence of aggravated enter a dwelling with intent, I sentence the offender to imprisonment for a fixed term of two years to date from 21 January 2010. I impose a fixed term because of the sentence I will now impose on the other matter.16 For the offence of assault police in the execution of his duty and cause actual bodily harm, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of two years to commence on 21 January 2011 with a head sentence of four years for that matter.17 Because of the length of the sentence it is not for me to impose conditions of parole but I recommend that the parole authorities give serious consideration to requiring as a condition of his parole that he attend a residential rehabilitation program such as that offered by Benelong’s Haven at Kempsey.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Shayan Sheikhlary appears for sentence today after having pleaded guilty at an early stage to an offence of supplying a prohibited drug. The drug in question was methylamphetamine. He asked that when I sentence him for that matter I take into account two other matters on a form one: One of possession of prohibited drug relating to 108.2 grams of cannabis and one of supplying prohibited drug, a drug by the name of benzylpiperazine, more commonly BZP.2 The police went to the offender’s premises on 25 August, 2009. They were armed with a search warrant. When they arrived they found a small quantity of cannabis and when they spoke to the offender he told them he had a confession to make. He said that he had a safe in the bathroom which contained within it a small to medium amount of Marijuana and a number of what he would call speed pills. When police searched the safe they found twenty-four methylamphetamine tablets in two separate forms as well as ten tablets of BZP. 3 The offender was then charged with supplying the methylamphetamine. By his plea of guilty and admission on the form one, he accepts that he had those drugs in his possession for the purposes of supplying them. It is also to be noted that police found other things in the accused’s premises consistent with him having those drugs in the possession for the purpose of supplying them. I refer here to digital scales which bore signs of previous use, receipts for Commonwealth Bank account deposits, including significant cash deposits at times and notes on paper which, although I do not actually have the notes before me, clearly were suggestive of supplying drugs. Were it necessary for me to make a determination, I would find that the accused was supplying to a substantial degree. In any case, I am able to say that this was not supplying at the bottom of the range. The accused had a number of tablets of two different drugs and there was significant evidence of other drug supplies. 4 The accused has a criminal history as well, mainly for offences of violence, but there are other matters involving drugs in his record. It is very important to note that at the time of committing these offences he was on a S 11 remand, it having been granted to him by a judge of this court. It is somewhat remarkable that at a time when the appellant was appealing against a sentence of imprisonment, and at a time that the judge hearing the appeal had adjourned the matter under s 11 in order to ascertain the appropriate sentence to impose, the offender would supply drugs and thereby commit very serious criminal offences.5 I note that the offender was actually in custody on these matters when he came back before the judge. Despite that circumstance, the judge did not dismiss the appeal but put Mr Sheikhlary on a s 9 bond.6 Mr Sheikhlary has told a probation and parole officer that he had an upbringing which was affected by his parent’s separation when he was only five years of age. Whatever the problems between him and his mother in the past, it now appears that he has her full support and that he very much regrets the position that he has put her in having, to visit her only child in custody. The offender recalled a poor relationship with his father and has not had any contact with him for about two years now. 7 The offender has been seen by a psychiatrist. I was also able to assess, briefly of course, the offender in court when he gave evidence. He seems to be an intelligent man who is quite capable of being a productive member of society. I note that the offender finished year nine in 1996 and was suspended and later expelled from school for inappropriate behaviour. He has worked mainly in unskilled positions but as far as I can see, he is capable of studying and capable of, upon release from custody, doing much for himself. 8 He has a relationship with a woman who is not a drug user and, with one exception, is not happy about his drug use. The one exception seems to be that she tolerated his use of Marijuana because he suffers from a disease known as Sherman’s Disease which causes pain to his back. Ms Martin suggests that in those circumstances, the offenders use of Marijuana might be explained. However, the offender is someone who clearly has a problem with drugs and if he is to break the cycle of offending he needs to give up drugs altogether, whether the drug is Marijuana or not.9 The offender has been doing some drug rehabilitation programs in custody and a report from Christos Aristidou tendered before me today suggests that he is doing well. However, the offender will need assistance in the future. He recognises that the life that he has been living up till now with regular offending is not the sort of life he wants to lead in the future. He will need some assistance in order to maximise the possibility that the offender can remain offence free upon his release from custody.10 The offender is serving his time in segregation because of threats from other prisoners. Of course there is a risk that that will involve harsher conditions of custody than it would involve if the offender was serving his sentence as part of the general prison population. There is a risk that that will be the case during the entirety of his term in prison. On top of that, as I have mentioned, the offender suffers from Sherman’s Disease. Those matters of course each will make the offenders time in custody harder than would otherwise be the case. I have taken those matters into account.11 The plea of guilty was entered at an early stage and so I have discounted the sentence I would otherwise have imposed by about twenty-five percent to reflect the utilitarian value of that plea. 12 The offender expressed his remorse for what he had done, in particular, as it affected his mother. 13 Clearly there are special circumstances in this case relating to the offenders desire to overcome his problems with drugs. It is in the community’s interest, just as it is in the offender’s interests, for him to succeed in that regard and so I will enlarge the period of eligibility for parole at the expense of a non-parole period to reflect that circumstance.14 Both Miss Martin in the letter she wrote to me and Mr Goold suggest that the offender’s time in custody, currently seven months, is enough. I do not agree, this was objectively a very serious offence. Of course there are more serious drug suppliers sentenced regularly in the courts but that does not automatically mean that this is an offence at the bottom of the range of objective seriousness. On top of that there is the circumstance that the offender failed to take advantage of the leniency that was offered to him when he was placed on a s 11 remand. Although there are explanations for the offender’s behaviour, in particular those referred to in the report from his psychiatrist, it remains the case that the offender himself needs to be personally deterred from future misconduct and the sentence that I have chosen to impose upon the offender has been selected with that very much in mind. It is part of the offender’s rehabilitation that he will know that if he commits further offences in the future, he will received significant, perhaps even harsh, sentences involving lengthy periods of full-time imprisonment. If the offender wants to avoid those, he needs to simply avoid committing further offences in the future.15 Taking into account the matters on the form one, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of fourteen months to date from 25 August, 2009. It will therefore end on 24 October, 2010 on which day the offender is to be released to parole. The head sentence is one of twenty-eight months.16 The condition of the offenders release to parole are as follows: 
     
      He is to be of good behaviour. 
     
     
      He is to refrain from any use of illegal drugs whatsoever, including Marijuana. 
     
     
      He is to be closely supervised, and I emphasise the word closely, by the Probation and Parole Service upon his release. 
     
     
      He is to be assessed for outpatient community drug rehabilitation programs. 
     
     
      He is to satisfactorily participate in courses, counselling and other programs as recommended by the Probation and Parole Service and he is to obey all reasonable directions of the Probation and Parole Service.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Samuel Barraz appears for sentence today. He pleaded guilty today to five offences on an indictment but they were in substitution for a number of matters to which he had earlier pleaded guilty at the Local Court. The pleas of guilty were entered at the earliest opportunity and so, consistent with the decision in R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, in order to reflect the utilitarian benefit of the pleas, the sentences I will announce at the end of these remarks will be twenty five per cent less than they would otherwise have been. 2 Mr Barraz is to be sentenced for three offences of engaging in transactions with the proceeds of crime and two offences of using copies of false instrument in order to persuade another person to accept it as a copy of a genuine instrument, in order that he could obtain some money.3 These five offences are far from the full extent of the offender’s criminality. Attached to each of the offences of engaging in transactions with the proceeds of crime are Form 1 matters. On each of the Form 1 matters there are either fourteen or fifteen further related offences. The total criminality engaged in by the offender extended over a period of about a year and ultimately led to him obtaining a significant sum of money, namely $153,000 through the use of fraudulent loan applications. 4 The offender came up with the scheme of obtaining loans by making on line loan applications to various credit unions and other finance institutions. He would pretend to them that he was someone else and that the loan was for the purpose of purchasing a motor vehicle. In order to persuade the financial institution to lend the money, a whole series of fraudulent activities had to be engaged in. False documents had to be prepared, false identities had to be procured and these activities all involved criminal behaviour on the part of the offender. Thus, although there were five separate occasions on which loans were falsely obtained, there were a total of something like forty nine separate offences committed by the offender over the year long period.5 It is not necessary in these remarks on sentence, which may ultimately be available to anyone with access to the internet, to outline specifically the modus operandi followed by the offender. It is sufficient to say that there was ongoing, regular criminality involved. In fact, the offender appears to have put a great deal of effort into his fraudulent activities. This was not a case where the offender simply, on one occasion, or even five occasions, decided to do something which was a crime. The offender seems to have been almost fully occupied in his dishonest conduct. Had he been fully occupied in a lawful occupation, he would have earned some money as well. The reason he chose to commit crimes rather than working lawfully, was simply because the rewards from committing crimes were greater than he could have obtained through legitimate work. 6 The offender was born in Brazil. His parents separated before he was born and he has had very little contact with his biological father. His mother needed to work to support herself and him and so he was cared for by his grandmother. At the age of six, his grandmother returned him to his mother but she in turn then placed him into a boarding school. The offender had a childhood which was characterised, therefore, by a lack of maternal contact. When he did return to live with his mother, she had, by that stage, remarried and the relationship that the offender had with his stepfather was a difficult one. I mention these matters, not simply to suggest that the offender is deserving of sympathy but because they are relevant to the sentence I should impose upon the offender in the following way. 7 The offender, after travelling overseas, met an Australian woman. They therefore began to live in this country but separated. Another relationship ended in 2002 and it is suggested by a psychologist, who interviewed the offender, that his early childhood experiences may have led to him taking the breakdown of his relationship in 2002 in a particularly hard way. It seems that after that relationship breakdown, the offender turned to drugs, alcohol and gambling, each of which he engaged in to excess. It was in those circumstances that he committed these offences. The money, I am told, was simply spent on those activities, although some of it seems to have been used to pay his co-offenders who cannot be located. 8 One very significant matter concerns the offender’s criminal history. At the time of these offences he was actually on bonds, and I emphasise the plural, for similar matters of fraud. That is a significantly aggravating feature of these present offences and one which will be reflected in the sentence that I will shortly announce. The offender was dealt with, apparently quite leniently, for those earlier fraudulent matters, and he has abused the leniency and the trust which the Court placed in him by his ongoing criminality for which I must sentence him. 9 These are very serious offences. The maximum penalty for the three offences of dealing with the proceeds of crime is fifteen years imprisonment which demonstrates at once the seriousness with which the legislature says these crimes should be treated. Many people legitimately need loans to buy cars. Finance companies are legitimately able to offer such loans. The offender has taken advantage of his skills and the procedures followed by financial institutions, to obtain a significant sum of money from them. It must be remembered too that the $153,000 which he obtained was tax free. He benefited significantly from his criminal activities. 10 Another matter I have borne in mind is that the offender got others involved in his criminality. This is also an aggravating factor. It is not a case where the offender, only himself, committed crimes, but he persuaded others to do so in order to assist him. 11 Some of the aggravating matters listed in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, (including some which Mr Salama conceded were matters of aggravation I should take into account) are either elements of the present offences or such that they would be necessarily involved in all offences of this nature. I will not regard them as aggravating factors which have increased the sentence to be imposed in the present case. For example, in s 21A is an aggravating circumstance that offences are committed for financial gain. That would be almost inevitable wherever a person committed a crime of knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime or perhaps using a copy of a false instrument and so I will not double count that feature. 12 It is said that the offender was of good character at the time he committed these offences. That of course is not the case, as I mentioned, he had committed earlier offences of fraud, there are other offences on his criminal history as well. It may be that before the breakup of his relationship in 2002, the offender was of good character and references indeed tend to suggest that that is the case. But by the time he committed these offences, certainly by the time he committed the last of them, he was far from a person of good character. 13 Mr Salama suggests that one of the mitigating features present in this case is that the offender has assisted the authorities in terms of s 23A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. It was said that he nominated the others involved in his crimes. It was said, without challenge from Mr Salama, by the Crown that the police already knew the information that was provided. I will not discount the sentence I would otherwise impose because of s 23A factor. 14 It was also said that the offender co-operated with police on his arrest and therefore there should be a discount under s 22A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. As I see 22A, that applies where there has been a trial, which has not been the case here. In any case, the offender’s co-operation seems to have simply been that he did not stand in the way of police doing what they were legitimately entitled to do, namely search his premises. I will not discount the sentence I would otherwise impose because of s 22A. 15 It is also said that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to re-offend. I cannot make that finding at all. The onus is on the offender to establish that on the balance of probabilities and he has failed to do so. Even the offender himself recognises that he will need some assistance upon his release from custody to deal with such things as his drug use, his alcohol consumption and also to enable him to re-establish himself as a law abiding member of society. 16 These are offences where there needs to be a substantial component of general deterrence. The finance companies who accept on line applications for loans and accept the accuracy of documents, faxed or otherwise forwarded to them, rely on the honesty of those making the applications for loans. It is, it seems, comparatively easy to do what the offender has done and so there must be a substantial component for general deterrence in order to persuade others who might be temped to take the easy path, who might be temped to use their endeavours in criminal activity, rather than getting a decent lawful job, that they should not do so because of the penalties which are likely to be imposed upon them when they are detected. The fact that the offender was on a bond at the time also suggests there needs to be a substantial component of personal deterrence. He needs to be made fully aware that when he gets into trouble in the future, when he finds himself depressed, when he finds himself turning to drugs and alcohol and gambling and, that when his money runs out, he should not use other people’s money illegally. Because ultimately what happened in this case was that the offender, after he had spent all his own money on gambling, drugs and alcohol, had a choice. He could have chosen to recognise that he could not spend any more money on gambling, drugs or alcohol, or he could have, as he did in this case, fund his addictions through other people’s moneys. It is that element of personal choice which requires significant punishment in the present case. 17 What I have chosen to do is to impose partially accumulative sentences on each of the more serious matters of knowingly dealing with proceeds of crime. It would be inappropriate given the length of time over which the various offences were committed, to impose wholly concurrent sentences. However, the principle of totality is such that the sentences are only partially accumulated so that the effective overall sentence reflects the effective overall criminality. 18 On count 1 on the indictment the offender is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of three years to date from 18 June 2007. That sentence is a fixed term because of other sentences I will impose. 19 On count 2 on the indictment the offender is sentenced to imprisonment to date from 18 June 2008. That will be a non-parole period of two years with a head sentence of three years.20 On count 4 on the indictment the offender is sentenced to imprisonment to date from 18 June 2009. That will consist of a non-parole period of one year with a head sentence of three years.21 On counts 3 and 5 on the indictment the offender is sentenced to imprisonment, I set a fixed term of imprisonment, for two years to date from 18 June 2007.22 The effective overall sentence is thus one of five years consisting of a non-parole period of three years and the balance of term of two years. The offender will be eligible to be released to parole on 17 June 2010. As will be obvious, I have found special circumstances. They are to be found in the report of Emma Collins, the psychologist, suggesting that the offender would benefit from an extended period of supervision on parole.

    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: I have before me an application that there be a Basha inquiry in relation to the evidence of a proposed Crown witness, Ms Virginie Bond. The trial involves allegations by the Crown that the accused became obsessed with a woman by the name of RM, to the extent that on 22 August 2006, he decided that he would have Ms M kidnapped.2 The Crown case is that to that end, the accused obtained the services of two men, who I think have not been identified, as well as an employee of his, Ms Bond. Ms Bond was told by the accused that she would be there in order to calm Ms M down after she had been kidnapped.3 Ms Bond has made a statement to the police attached to an interview. In the interview, she gives a description of the events of 22 August 2006, that being the night on which the Crown says the accused went to Ms M’s home with Ms Bond and the two other men for the purpose of kidnapping Ms M. 4 Mr King says that it would be permissible and useful for Ms Bond to be cross-examined by him on voir dire. In attempting to identify the issues that Ms Bond would be cross-examined about, I have looked at the interview, the further statement made by Ms Bond and also heard what Mr King has said about the nature of the challenge to Ms Bond’s evidence. 5 It is not clear that Mr King will be suggesting that Ms Bond is lying rather than simply mistaken. Mr King tells me that tactical decisions will have to be made once Ms Bond has given her evidence before the jury. However, it would, at first blush, seem to be difficult for the accused to proffer an innocent explanation for the things that Ms Bond has said.6 It would be, on the material before me at present, highly unlikely that ultimately Mr King would be submitting to the jury that Ms Bond was simply mistaken given the nature of the events that she describes including men with balaclavas being armed with machetes.7 A Basha inquiry is an unusual procedure. It is certainly not unknown and courts regularly allow what is effectively a dry run at cross-examining witnesses on occasions. Basha inquiries are perhaps even more important since the gradual change in committal proceedings from being occasions where all the Crown witnesses were available for cross-examination to the present situation where hurdles must be overcome before witnesses are cross-examined at committal.8 It is clearly the case that there may be some witnesses who magistrates correctly decide should not be cross-examined but who should be cross-examined on a Basha inquiry in order to ensure that the trial of an accused is fair.9 In this case, I note that there was no application, at the committal stage, for Ms Bond to be cross-examined. That is not terribly relevant but I do note that it did not apparently occur to those earlier representing Mr Day that there would be any benefit in such cross-examination. 10 The onus is on the accused to demonstrate that I should grant the application for the Basha inquiry. Basha inquiries should not be lightly granted. It is the experience of the criminal courts that witnesses are on occasion so affected by the experience of being cross-examined at a criminal trial that they refuse to allow to have the experience repeated. It would, in my opinion, be naïve to assume that Ms Bond will necessarily voluntarily assist the prosecution by returning for cross-examination before a jury after she has been first cross-examined on a Basha inquiry.11 I make those comments irrespective of the nature of the particular application before me but it is the general experience of the criminal courts that witnesses on occasion will refuse to come back to court after being cross-examined. Ms Bond is twenty years of age and it is likely that cross-examination of her would be challenging.12 The onus is on the accused to demonstrate that his trial will be unfair in the event that Ms Bond is not cross-examined. Mr King quite appropriately in his written submissions set out those particular areas where he proposed to cross-examine Ms Bond. It should not be thought that Mr King would need to cross-examine at the trial without knowing much of the information that he would seek in cross-examining Ms Bond. He could obtain much of that information simply by asking the Crown or asking the police officers involved or even asking Ms Bond herself. It is certainly not the case that if this application is refused, that Mr King is unable to inform himself of many of the matters about which he would cross-examine Ms Bond on a Basha inquiry.13 In particular, Mr King says that he knows nothing about how the interview of 22 November 2006 came into existence. He could always ask. It does not require a Basha inquiry for him to find out, from police at least, what it was that led up to that interview. The police could also be asked what they said to Ms Bond before the interview took place. It remains a possibility, of course, that the police might say something which Ms Bond disagrees with when she is cross-examined in court but the purpose of a Basha inquiry is not to provide potential contradictory evidence.14 Mr King says that the Basha inquiry might even reveal that Ms Bond’s evidence was contaminated. If the cross-examination at trial did reveal that then it would always be open for the evidence to be excluded, even though it had been given, probably then requiring the discharge of the jury.15 In almost every case, it could be said that it would be useful to have a dry run at cross-examining a witness. It would probably be useful, for Mr King at least, to have a dry run at cross-examining Ms Bond but that is not sufficient to demonstrate that a Basha inquiry should be held. As I have said, the better test is whether the trial of the accused would be fair in the absence of a Basha inquiry.16 I am satisfied that there is has been nothing demonstrated to me that would suggest that the trial would be unfair in the absence of a Basha inquiry. Of course, if events reveal later on that I was wrong in that conclusion then, as I mentioned before, it is always possible that the jury would be discharged and a new trial held. For those reasons, the application for a Basha inquiry is refused.

    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff, Mr Wolodymyr Holovinsky, is more commonly known as Fred Holovinsky. The plaintiff is a former sergeant of police. He was attested as a probationary constable on 2 July 1973, and thereupon became a contributor of the Police Superannuation Fund established under the Police Regulation (Superannuation) Act 1906 (“the Act”).2 Mr Holovinsky resigned his office as sergeant of police with effect on 19 March 1997. On 27 September 2000 the Police Superannuation Advisory Committee established under the Act, certified that at the time of his resignation, the plaintiff had been incapable of discharging the duties of his office on account of the infirmity of “Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety and Depressed Mood and Post Traumatic Disorder” pursuant to s 10B(2)(b) of the Act.3 On 9 October 2000, the defendant, the Commissioner of Police, determined that the suffering by the plaintiff of the infirmity certified by the Police Superannuation Advisory Committee was not caused by the plaintiff’s having been hurt on duty. From that decision of the Commissioner of Police, the plaintiff brings this appeal, pursuant to s 21 of the Act.4 These proceedings were commenced by an application for determination filed in the Compensation Court of New South Wales on 21 November 2000. That application provides scant, if any, particulars. The date of injury was said to be between 2 July 1973 and 19 March 1997. The 2 July 1973 was when the plaintiff was attested as a probationary constable of police. The 19 March 1997 was the date of his resignation. The application asked “How did the injury occur”. The following material was provided: 
     
      
      “As a consequence of the stress placed on the Applicant during the course of his employment”. 
      
    5 An amended application for determination was filed on 1 March 2001. The only amendments made by that application were to insert the correct certified infirmity and the correct date of the decision under appeal.6 On 22 January 2003, the plaintiff’s solicitors provided certain particulars to the solicitor for the defendant. 7 The particulars delivered are not particularly illuminating because the request that had been made by the solicitor for the defendant was not well crafted. Essentially what was relied upon by the plaintiff was the investigation of all complaints relating to criminal activities, the apprehension and charging of offenders, and administrative police work associated with those two tasks, that is, basically the type of work the plaintiff did as a police officer.8 Elliptically there was reference to a criminal charge that had been made against the plaintiff. Paragraph 3(e)(iii) said: 
     
      
      “That the police service knowing the applicant was a police officer who provided information of a criminal activity to a fellow police officer allowed such information to become so mixed that the applicant became an accused thereby, aggravating his pre-existing psychological conditions”. 
      
    9 Further particulars were provided on 28 April 2003 by the plaintiff’s solicitors in answer to a further request for particulars, but again they are not particularly illuminating, for exactly the same reason.10 Further particulars delivered on 6 May 2003 essentially repeat the earlier allegations.11 Particulars of claim in accordance with the then rules of the Compensation Court were filed on 11 July 2003. They refer to a large number of incidents that occurred to the plaintiff in the course of his police duty. The first of them is the suicide of a 14-year-old girl in 1974. The next is attending upon the suicide of a young male in 1975. The third is a situation which occurred in the mid 1970s at the White Bay Hotel where the plaintiff was acting undercover to try to ascertain who was selling stolen goods. The fourth allegation was of an event at the Bathurst Races on 25 March 1978. The fifth matter was an assault upon the plaintiff on 24 October 1979 when he was working at Redfern Detectives and was assaulted by a group of Aborigines. The next matter relied upon was an assault at a rugby league match in 1980. The next matter relied upon was the plaintiff’s part in the investigation of what has become known as the Milperra Massacre or the Milperra Father’s Day Massacre.12 The next event relied upon was a needle stick injury in either 1985 or 1986. The next incident relied upon was an assault by an Islander in March 1986. There were then general allegations of investigating rapes and in particular, one rape in 1982 or 1983 of a 14-year old girl, the daughter of a friend of the plaintiff.13 There was then a general allegation of attending murder scenes which were extremely stressful and in particular, the murder of a Mr Joe Borg in either 1974 or 1975.14 The final matter given in those particulars was this: 
     
      
      “On 24 August-8 September the Applicant went off on stress leave. The anxiety, stress, depression, lack of counselling resort to drinking alcohol had built up to a point such that the Applicant felt rejected by the Police Service. It was during this period and prior that the Applicant had received certain information in the course of his duties concerning Henry Charles Landini which was imparted to another officer and ultimately led to his arrest and charging on 31 December 1990.” 
      
    15 Amended particulars of claim were filed in this court on 26 March 2004. They list between paragraphs 4 and 25 incidents which were alleged to cause “trauma and stress”.16 Paragraphs 25 to 28 of those particulars are in the following terms: 
     
      
      “25. On 31 December 1990 the Applicant was arrested by internal affairs officers and charged with conspiracy to cultivate prohibited plant, offer bribe and conspiracy to cultivate commercial quantity of prohibited drug. He was then suspended from duty. 
      
     
     
      
      26. Following his being charged, the Applicant was detained in custody for about one month during which time he suffered severe emotional and psychological trauma.  
      
     
     
      
      27. A search warrant was executed upon the Applicant at his home and his house was searched. This had an adverse effect upon the Applicant and his family causing him to feel humiliation and shame. 
      
     
     
      
      28. The Applicant suffered adverse publicity in the media generated by his being charged and suffered anxiety as a result of such publicity as affecting his reputation and that of his family.” 
      
    17 Paragraphs 29 to 34 essentially set out the aftermath of the plaintiff’s being charged and arrested.18 At the commencement of the hearing, the plaintiff was relying on the amended particulars of claim filed on 26 March 2004. 19 On the morning of 7 June 2005, after nine days of hearing, the amended particulars were further amended. At the same time, a concession was made. The concession and amendments are shown in exhibit N.20 The plaintiff conceded that the certified infirmity was not due to his being hurt on duty in respect of either the facts and matters alleged in paragraphs 4 to 24 and 31 and 33 of the amended particulars or by any incident or assault involving Senior Sergeant O’Connor or any male offender on 15 January 1990 or any subsequent investigation thereof.21 However the plaintiff maintained that his conversations with one Robert McDougall, Bill Treacy and Rod Moore and the plaintiff’s resultant arrest and exposure to the criminal justice process caused compensable injury in that the plaintiff was thereby “hurt on duty”.22 On the nineteenth day of the hearing the plaintiff made a further concession which has been marked exhibit W. In that concession, the plaintiff admitted that the decision by the Commissioner of Police and his Delegate to arrest and charge the plaintiff was made in good faith and the due exercise of the duties and powers of the New South Wales Police Service on the evidence available to the Commissioner of Police and his Delegate. Further, the plaintiff admitted that such decision did not involve any improper or illegal conduct or conspiracy by the Commissioner of Police or his Delegate. Subsequently the plaintiff conceded that that admission extended to the role played in the arrest and charging of the plaintiff on 31 December 1990 by then Detective Inspector Schuberg and Detective Inspector Smith. 23 Accordingly, the remaining issue before me, from the plaintiff’s point of view, is an allegation that the arrest and charging of the plaintiff on 31 December 1990 and conduct that led to that arrest and charging were the cause of his suffering the certified infirmity and that the suffering of that infirmity arose out of the plaintiff’s employment or duty. It is not alleged in these proceedings that the arrest and charging arose in the course of the plaintiff’s service or duty. The plaintiff relies on a causal relationship between his service or duty and his arrest and charging. 24 The defendant has filed four different answers. There was one filed on 5 October 2001, another filed on 28 July 2003, another filed on 6 May 2004 and a final amended answer filed on 11 May 2004 which is the document upon which the defendant relies. The first part of the answer denies that the plaintiff sustained any injury in the course of his duties or employment with the New South Wales police service and that the certified infirmity was not due to any such injury. Particulars have been provided although, strictly speaking, there is no need to provide particulars of a traverse. However, the defendant specifically provides particulars about an event on 15 January 1990 when the defendant alleged the plaintiff went with Senior Sergeant O’Connor to the Five Dock Hotel where an altercation occurred between the plaintiff and Senior Sergeant O’Connor. 25 The next “particular” provided was an allegation of the plaintiff’s being involved in a motor car accident on 23 August 1990 which caused him to be summoned to the Campbelltown Local Court on a charge of driving with a high range prescribed concentration of alcohol. 26 The next “particular” deals with the circumstances leading to the plaintiff’s being arrested and charged and subsequently being served with an order under section 181D of the Police Act 1990 and then an application in the Supreme Court to set aside such order. The next substantive plea in the answer is an allegation of serious and wilful misconduct. Six particulars are provided, essentially the particulars numbered between three and six relate to the circumstances of the plaintiff’s arrest and charging. The fourth paragraph raises a defence under section 11A of the Workers Compensation Act 1987 but that plea is bad in law because the only events relied upon occurred in 1990 and section 11A was not then in force. The final allegation in the answer raises a defence under section 9A of the Workers Compensation Act 1987 but again that allegation is bad in law because section 9A was not in force at the time of the events in 1990.27 The essential issue that I have to determine can be expressed in a number of ways. It is whether the certified infirmity was caused by the plaintiff’s being “hurt on duty”. That term is defined in the Act as meaning injured in such circumstances as were the plaintiff a worker within the meaning of the Workers Compensation Act he would be entitled to compensation under that Act. Essentially that becomes whether the certified infirmity resulted from injury arising out of or in the course of the plaintiff’s employment. Since the plaintiff does not rely on a temporal relationship between the certified infirmity and his service or duty, the issue is whether the certified infirmity has resulted from an injury arising out of the plaintiff’s employment. Essentially the plaintiff’s case is whether the certified infirmity was caused by the arrest, charging, and period in Long Bay Gaol when the plaintiff was bail refused and a subsequent lengthy committal hearing at which the plaintiff was discharged, the filing of an ex officio indictment by the Director of Public Prosecutions and then a lengthy trial in this Court in the exercise of its criminal jurisdiction before his Honour Judge Gibson and a jury, which led to the plaintiff’s acquittal, caused the certified infirmity and if so, whether it is related to the plaintiff’s duty or service.28 Essentially, there is no medical argument in this case. The plaintiff relies on an opinion of Dr Strum and the defendant relies on an opinion of Dr Champion that the arrest and charging and the sequelae of the arrest and charging were the cause of the plaintiff’s psychiatric condition. Indeed those gentlemen accept that the occurrence of post-traumatic stress disorder was caused by the circumstances of the plaintiff’s being incarcerated in Long Bay Gaol. In her oral evidence before me, Dr Wendy Walker agreed that such could well be the case. Policemen have an overwhelming fear of being incarcerated in a place such as Long Bay Gaol where it becomes known that the policeman is in fact a policeman and where the police officer may come into contact with those that he himself has arrested or charged or given evidence against and who are in gaol because of the efforts of that police officer. That is vividly displayed in the plaintiff’s evidence before me and really needs no further comment.29 As I said there is no real medical issue despite a thesis of Dr Wendy Walker. Her opinion expressed in her report was that the plaintiff had the certified infirmities prior to the events with which I am currently concerned. She had a large number of conferences with the plaintiff and took very detailed histories about every noteworthy event that occurred to the plaintiff in the course of his police duty between 1973 and 1990 and subsequently. Her thesis is that the development of post-traumatic stress disorder, in particular, was the result of the cumulative event of the plaintiff’s involvement with horrifying scenes, frightening events, assaults with blood and gore, so to speak, throughout his service but she conceded that the events with which I am concerned, certainly aggravated or made worse the preceding condition. Dr Walker’s thesis is based on a theory which is not unanimously accepted by members of the medical profession. Indeed it was not an opinion that Dr Champion would adhere to because, in his view, exposure to stressors over a period of time causes the process of desensitisation which inures those who experience, for example, blood and gore, autopsies, dead bodies et cetera, to take that as a normal incident of service. It is not necessary for me to consider the view of Dr Walker any further because her evidence is not supported by the evidence of the plaintiff himself who admitted that he was able to function as normally as he could as a police officer up until the time of his arrest.30 The plaintiff had commenced his case based on all the events that occurred to him over his period in the New South Wales Police Force but in light of how the evidence was coming out, the concession made by learned senior counsel for the plaintiff on 7 June 2005 was very properly made. Again to repeat the issue, it is essentially whether the circumstances leading to the plaintiff’s arrest and charging and all that followed, arose out of his employment, service or duty as a police officer and that requires a detailed consideration of events between August and December 1990. I shall not immediately turn to that inquiry. I should like beforehand to deal with a number of other matters. 31 I must firstly advert to the corpus of the evidence before me. Today is the twenty-ninth day of the hearing of this matter. The hearing commenced on 6 December 2004 and has gone over three different sessions, one in late 2004, one in the middle of 2005, when an adjournment was sought by the plaintiff and granted, and then for four weeks commencing on 31 July 2006. There are currently available to me one thousand one hundred and seventy-one pages of transcript, although two days of submissions have not yet been transcribed or if they have been, the transcripts are not currently available to me. In addition to that, there are thousands of pages of documentary evidence. Early in the hearing the defendant tendered eighteen lever arch binders containing 4057 pages of documents. Objection was taken to a large number of those documents and dealing with the objections took a number of days. However, the remaining documents are still contained in the eighteen lever arch binders and most of them are still substantially full. Since the tender of those documents, three further lever arch binders of documents have been tendered and loose exhibits would fill another lever arch binder. There are accordingly, some twenty-two lever arch binders of documents in evidence. In addition to the oral submissions, which lasted four days, I have been assisted with one hundred and ninety-five pages of written submissions.32 The evidence is vast and some of it only of remote relevance. Partly that is explicable by the fact that when the case started, the issues were much, much wider than the discrete issue with which I now must deal. I am dealing with this matter by way of an ex-tempore judgment because to reserve the judgment would require me to have six to eight weeks of free time available without any other professional or personal commitments which would be a well-nigh impossible task. 33 Before I turn to a consideration of events between August and December 1990, I will deal with three separate issues. The first is to recount a chronology of events in order to put the matter in context, after that I shall deal with two observations of moment concerning credibility and reliability of the evidence before me. 34 The plaintiff was born on 1 May 1948. He was born in Germany to Ukrainian parents who no doubt found themselves in Germany because of massive displacement following World War II. The plaintiff is currently fifty-eight years of age. At the relevant time, that is in the second half of 1990, he was forty-two years of age.35 The plaintiff migrated to Australia in 1949 with his family. He attended Merrylands Primary School and Merrylands High School. One of his fellow school boys at those schools, was Mr William Alfred Treacy known as Bill Treacy. The plaintiff left High School with the Leaving Certificate in 1964. He then obtained work with the ANZ Bank as a clerk. From 1965 to 1968 he was employed in the Commonwealth Public Service in the Department of Customs and Excise. He then went to Wagga Wagga Teacher’s College, I infer, for one year where he enjoyed the social life but appears to have been struggling with his studies. Between 1969 and 1971 the plaintiff performed National Service. In the army he became a physical training instructor. All physical training personnel in the Army are assigned to the Artillery. The plaintiff reached the rank of Bombardier. Essentially the plaintiff worked, training those who were to go to serve in the Vietnam War. At the completion of the plaintiff’s National Service, he recommenced his Teacher’s College studies but this time at a campus at Lindfield. He did not complete those studies, electing to join the police force instead.36 On 21 May 1973, the plaintiff commenced training at the Police Academy at Redfern. On 2 July 1973, as I have already mentioned, he was attested as a probationary constable of police. He was then twenty-five years of age. His initial service was at Redfern police station. He was attested as a police constable on 2 July 1974. He then went to Blacktown Police Station where he performed general duties for four years. On 20 May 1977, the plaintiff married his wife Vera. The plaintiff and his wife have two daughters, Natalie and Katherine. At the time of the plaintiff’s arrest, Natalie was ten and Katherine was six. One can understand that the plaintiff’s arrest and charging and the aftermath would have had a devastating effect, not only on the plaintiff’s wife, but in particular, upon his children.37 On 6 December 1977, the plaintiff commenced plainclothes work with Number 21 Special Squad. On 29 August 1978 he became a Constable First Class. In 1980, he undertook a detective’s course, and in that year was appointed to the Campbelltown detectives. In March 1983 he was transferred to the Liverpool detectives. On 14 April 1983, he was appointed to the Armed Hold-up Squad at Penrith. On 8 April 1984, he was transferred to the Criminal Investigation Bureau in Sydney. However, things did not go well for the plaintiff when he was working in the CIB. On 16 December 1984 he was transferred to General Duties work, that is work in uniform, at the Burwood police station. The plaintiff was to remain attached to the Burwood patrol until 1990. Burwood has a substation at Five Dock and it would appear that the plaintiff performed a fair amount of his work at the Five Dock police station. For one month only in his period at Burwood, the plaintiff had a secondment to work for the Ashfield detectives. In his affidavit, exhibit B, the plaintiff said this in relation to his transfer from detective’s work to general duties uniformed work: 
     
      
      “Upon my return [from the Milperra massacre taskforce to the CIB], I was under the supervision of Sergeant Second Class Graham Frazer with whom I ended up having a difference of opinion. I believe it was more of a personality clash than anything else, and this resulted in my being transferred to uniform duties at Burwood police station. I became aware at this stage, that my career as a Detective would be finished unless there was a change in the hierarchy.” 
      
    38 From the evidence before me it would appear that the clash with his superior in the CIB involved an allegation of the plaintiff’s taking cash money about which there was a dispute. The plaintiff maintained that his ambition after being transferred back to general duties at Burwood was to again seek to become a detective and indeed, to become a leader of a group of detectives, either at some patrol or command of some special force or squad.39 On 11 October 1988, the plaintiff was promoted to the rank of Sergeant of police. On 15 January 1990, the plaintiff was assaulted. He had commenced duty that day at 3pm, that is an afternoon shift. At some time around at 6pm or 7pm, or sometime in between, the plaintiff took off his appointments and his police shirt and donned a red polo shirt and proceeded to go to the Five Dock Hotel. He met there with Senior Sergeant O’Connor. At the time Senior Sergeant O’Connor was the highest ranking officer at the Five Dock police station, that is he was the highest ranking police officer on that shift. The plaintiff was the station sergeant so he was the second highest ranked police officer on that shift. It appears that the plaintiff and Senior Sergeant Smith then proceeded to drink alcohol for either three or four hours until approximately ten o’clock. The plaintiff alleges that as he was walking back from the hotel to the police station, he was assaulted by an unknown Islander without any provocation and for no ostensible reason. This person is alleged to have given the plaintiff a king-hit for no apparent reason at all while he was walking the short distance between the hotel and the police station. Subsequently it emerged that Senior Sergeant O’Connor admitted to his immediate superior that he had assaulted the plaintiff but he then retracted that admission. Mr Holovinsky maintains to this day that it was the unknown Islander who assaulted him. I am unable in this matter to make a finding that it was Senior Sergeant O’Connor. However, what is clear is that the plaintiff, whilst he was supposed to be on duty and in charge at the police station, was drinking at the hotel for three or four hours, schooners of beer.40 The plaintiff admitted that he caused to be made a false entry in the occurrence pad of the police station and the plaintiff admitted to me that he lied about these matters to a superior. The plaintiff made a formal statement about the assault upon him on 17 January 1990. Paragraph 7 of that statement is this: 
     
      
      “Just prior to 10pm I decided to go and buy some cigarettes. I usually smoke a pipe but on this occasion I wanted to buy some cigarettes. I knew that the shops were closed and rather than enter the Five Dock Hotel in uniform, and one out [sic], I put on a red golf shirt which I had worn to work. I then walked down to the hotel and I saw the barmaid Rose. I also saw the manager, Mr Jeff Brown and I said ‘hello’. I got some change for the cigarette machine and just at this time Senior Sergeant O’Connor walked in wearing a black t-shirt. He suggested to me that I was drinking on duty. I emphatically denied this allegation.” 
      
    The first paragraph of that statement contains a lie and the second last and the last sentences contain a lie because if Senior Sergeant O’Connor did ask the plaintiff whether he was drinking on duty and he emphatically denied the allegation, the allegation was, in fact, correct. The plaintiff now admits he had been drinking in the hotel for three or four hours. In the next paragraph of his statement the plaintiff says that he walked over to the cigarette machine and purchased a packet of cigarettes from the machine then he walked down the stairs and out onto the street and that Sergeant O’Connor was in his company. They parted at one place and after the plaintiff had left the company of Senior Sergeant O’Connor, the plaintiff was approached by the person of Islander appearance who committed the assault upon him. That statement was witnessed by Inspector Braid. Inspector Braid then asked the plaintiff two questions which were typed onto the foot of the statement and answered and then witnessed by both Inspector Braid and signed by the plaintiff. The questions and answers are: 
     
      
      “Q1. Did you while at the hotel consume any intoxicating liquor? 
       
      A. No. 
      
     
     
      
      Q2. Did you at any time during your shift consume any intoxicating liquor? 
       
      A. No.” 
      
    Both those statements are lies.41 There was then an investigation that was conducted by Chief Inspector Lammiman. The Chief Inspector sought to interview the plaintiff on 11 March 1990 but the plaintiff exercised his right to remain silent. The investigation was to have certain consequences. The plaintiff in his evidence to me said that whilst at the Five Dock Hotel with Senior Sergeant O’Connor he consumed six schooners of beer. He maintained to me that he was not intoxicated at the time.42 After the assault the plaintiff was taken by a police vehicle to the Concord Repatriation Hospital. An administration officer at that hospital was Mr Mark William Foster. He was on duty at the counter of the Casualty department of that hospital at about 10.35pm on 15 January 1990. He made a statement to a Chief Inspector Lammiman. In that statement Mr Foster said this: 
     
      
      “About 10.35pm a man came into the Casualty section whom I now know as Fred Holovinsky. At the time he was accompanied by two other Policemen who were all in uniform. 
      
     
     
      
      At the time he was very aggressive when he came to the Counter and claimed that he had been assaulted on duty, he was quite aggressive and demanded that he be seen immediately.  
      
     
     
      
      As it can be seen on this form 4, patients came in by ambulance suffering from chest pain between the hours of 23.50 and 0020 and they get priority. He discharged himself and left the hospital.  
      
     
     
      
      When I saw Mr Fred Holovinsky I smelt a quite reasonable strong smell of intoxicating liquor on his breath because when I was asking him his details, I could smell it then. His speech was slightly slurred, and he was aggressive.” 
      
    Inspector Lammiman also obtained a statement from the sister in charge of the Casualty section at the time, Sister Shirley Fawcett.43 In her statement Sister Fawcett said this: 
     
      
      “At the time I saw him he was on his own. At the time he wanted to go to the toilet, however on medical grounds I wouldn’t let him so I requested that he urinate in a bottle. I then took him into a room and he used the bottle and I brought him back into the hallway so that I could observe him and he said to me, “if I can’t see a doctor immediately I’m going”. He was restless and very intoxicated. He was acting that way. I said, “would you wait for a minute until I get a doctor to get you to sign a release form”. Mr Holovinsky then signed the release form and left to go to the waiting room. I didn’t see him after that. 
      
     
     
      
      I formed the opinion that he had been drinking, I smelt a beery smell about him, by his actions and manner I felt that he had been drinking.” 
      
    There can be little doubt that Mr Holovinsky, the plaintiff, was drinking and that he was intoxicated. Clearly when he donned the red tee shirt to go to the hotel to the drinking session with Senior Sergeant O’Connor the plaintiff abandoned his employment. This was no authorised absence. When he was returning from the hotel he was not on duty because he had abandoned his employment.44 To suggest that the injury he sustained in the assault arose out of or in the course of his employment is a nonsense, yet the plaintiff maintained that he was assaulted in the course of his duty and claimed hurt on duty benefits. They appear to have been paid to him.45 On 6 April 1990 Chief Inspector Lammiman presented his report. He recommended that the plaintiff be charged with making a false report of a criminal offence at Five Dock on 15 January 1990. He recommended the plaintiff be charged with creating a public mischief at Five Dock on 15 January 1990 and he recommended a Departmental charge of misconduct be preferred against the plaintiff concerning his actions at the Five Dock Hotel on 15 January 1990. That proposal received the agreement of the Ombudsman.46 Eventually the Commissioner of Police, through an Assistant Commissioner, decided not to proceed criminally against the plaintiff but sought advice as to whether a Departmental charge should be preferred. On 20 August 1990 a report was made to the Assistant Commissioner of Police for Professional Responsibility that the plaintiff be charged Departmentally. It would appear that word of that had flown around the police world.47 On 22 August 1990 the plaintiff attended upon his general practitioner, Dr Guest, and told him that he was “feeling tense over an alleged police inquiry”. The quotation is from Dr Guest’s notes. Clearly the reason for the plaintiff’s presentation to Dr Guest was the impending charge or the then current investigation. The diagnosis made by Dr Guest was of an acute anxiety state. Eventually Dr Guest was to issue certificates to cover periods of absences from work between 22 August 1990 and 7 September 1990. The following day was a day on which the plaintiff had been certified as being unfit to work because of his acute anxiety state. He spent the morning of that day playing golf. The two, of course, are not inconsistent. Physical activity for those suffering a mental illness is often a desirable thing. It can distract the patient from the nervous stress.48 However after the playing of golf the plaintiff to use the vernacular which I used in asking a question, spent too much time at the 19th hole. At approximately 5.50pm the plaintiff was involved in a motor vehicle accident when his car collided with the rear of another car which was turning right. The plaintiff made attempts to minimise his culpability for the occurrence of that collision but it clearly was his civil fault which caused the collision.49 About 7.15pm on 23 August 1990 Sergeant Hynes of the Campbelltown Police Station was called to the radio room at that police station where he had a conversation over the radio with Constable Elliott who requested his attendance at the scene of the accident. When Sergeant Hynes arrived there he saw the plaintiff whom he had known for a number of years. Sergeant Hynes established that the plaintiff was the driver of the car in question. Sergeant Hynes asked Constable Elliott whether he had administered a roadside breath test to the plaintiff. Constable Elliott replied in the negative and said that is why he had caused Sergeant Hynes to be called. It is understandable that a junior police officer might not want to administer a roadside breath test to a senior police officer.50 Sergeant Hynes report of 23 August 1990 contains this in paragraph 3: 
     
      
      “At the time that I first saw Sergeant Holovinsky he was on all fours and when I came closer to him I could smell liquor and when he got to his feet he was very unsteady on his feet. I could also see that his eyes were bloodshot and weepy.” 
      
     
     
      
    The roadside breath test was then administered and returned a reading of .280. A formal section 4E certificate determined a reading of .200. As a result of driving with that blood alcohol level the plaintiff was served with a summons to attend a Local Court. He did so. It would appear that he pleaded guilty to a charge of high range PCA and was fined $600 and disqualified for driving for six months. When that court appearance and penalty were imposed the evidence does not disclose.51 The plaintiff’s certificates of unfitness issued by Dr Guest expired on 7 September 1990. On that day the plaintiff saw the police medical officer who certified that the plaintiff could return to full duties, noting that the plaintiff wished to return to work. However it is clear from the police medical officer’s notes that the police medical officer was concerned about the plaintiff’s alcohol intake which the police medical officer wished to review with the plaintiff’s general practitioner. At that interview with the police medical officer the plaintiff declined to see a psychologist for drug and alcohol counselling.52 Some time in September 1990, it may have been on 8 September 1990, the plaintiff was transferred from Burwood Police Station to Newtown Police Station. The plaintiff appeared to me to believe that that was some form of punitive transfer but it is equally possible that it was to assist the plaintiff who could no longer drive a motor vehicle. Travelling between Campbelltown and Newtown is a direct route by rail whereas there is no direct route by rail from Burwood to Campbelltown as I understand it.53 I am omitting from this chronology of events the pertinent events to which I must in due course turn. On 26 September 1990 at 10am the plaintiff was served with a Departmental charge. The charge was this: 
     
      
      “That on 15 January 1990, you were under the influence of intoxicating liquor whilst on duty.” 
      
    The charge could have been better worded. The charge could have been worded “that on 18 January 1990 you were under the influence of intoxicating liquor whilst rostered on duty”.54 On 3 October 1990 the plaintiff wrote a response to the charge saying that he was not guilty of it and that he elected to have the matter heard and determined by the Police Tribunal of New South Wales. That Tribunal was of course, constituted by a Judge of this Court. The hearing of the charge before the Police Tribunal was eventually listed for hearing on 14 March 1991.55 On 12 December 1990 the plaintiff went off work with a diagnosis of acute anxiety and depression. He was to remain absent from duty until 12 December 1990. It is difficult to determine the exact reason which caused the plaintiff to go off work at that time. The plaintiff was supposed to attend a police funeral but it would appear that he did not do so as he was “too ill” to do so.56 As I have earlier indicated the plaintiff was arrested early in the morning of 31 December 1990. He was taken to the Campbelltown Police Station and was charged. He sought bail from the police but that was refused. He appeared before the Local Court at Campbelltown on that day. It would appear the court was constituted by the Registrar of the Court, no doubt a Chamber Magistrate or Justice of the Peace. Bail was refused because of the seriousness of the charge. Because it was New Year’s Eve the plaintiff could not be taken to a gaol. He remained in the cells at the Campbelltown Police Station until 2 January 1991. On that occasion he appeared before Mr Kearney SM. The plaintiff was represented by Mr John Marsden. Mr Kearney refused bail because of the seriousness of the offences charged.57 Annexed to the plaintiff’s affidavit which is exhibit B is a press clipping from the Macarthur Advertiser. That refers to the plaintiff’s appearance before Mr Kearney SM on 2 January 1991. That reports that the learned Magistrate refused bail because of the seriousness of the allegations made. The newspaper article contains this quotation from the remarks of the learned Magistrate: 
     
      
      “This is not a backyard cultivation, this is a major illegal commercial venture in excess of $8 million.” 
      
    58 It appears from that press clipping that a co-accused William Alfred Tracy was also refused bail by the learned Magistrate and that there were three alleged co-conspirators who were to appear in the Bega Local Court. The press clipping is headed “Sergeant’s drug charge” and one can understand the distress that that would have caused the plaintiff and his family.59 The plaintiff was taken to Long Bay Gaol. The plaintiff gave this evidence in chief when asked what happened when he arrived at Long Bay Gaol: 
     
      
      “I couldn’t believe that it had happened to me, I couldn’t believe that I’d be going to Long Bay Gaol. I was taken inside the gates into the reception area. They took my possessions. They took me over to a room where they gave me a pair of shorts that were ripped and this shirt that was five sizes too small, a pair of old sandshoes. They then marched me through to the protection section, up a set of stairs into a - as I was walking into the reception area I glanced around and the first thing I saw was Jimmy Safwan. Jimmy Safwan was a fellow in 1984 I’d arrested and charged with six or seven charges of armed robbery and attempted murder, who I knew to be extremely violent and bad criminal. I walked in straight past him, up the stairs, I opened a cell, they just told me to go in there. I tried the light, there was no light. There was a small gap in the cell, a little bit of moon coming through there. The basin that I had was broken. There was a mattress. I think the mattress - the legs were broken on the springs underneath that and I just closed the door.” 
      
    Further on the plaintiff said this: 
     
      
      “I was most anxious about my safety after seeing that Jimmy Safwan was the first name I saw there, I was concerned that it wouldn’t take long for the news to travel and that I was there and the following morning I was sure that everybody knew who I was and what I was because as they escorted me out of the area into another segregation area they had the prison riot squad there with their dogs giving me a guard of honour down the passageway to go through to the segregation area.” 
      
    The plaintiff also gave evidence in chief of being concerned about the food and drink that he was being served. He was frightened that he could be poisoned or for example spat into by other prisoners. At times when the plaintiff went to court he returned from court to find that his cell had been, to use the modern vernacular, “trashed”. He also told me that one of the prison guards drew a caricature of him sitting in a garden with “sixteen million” worth of marijuana plants and his tending the plants and put that picture in the plaintiff’s cell.60 The plaintiff again appeared at the Campbelltown Local Court on 9 January 1991 before Mr Shepherd SM but remained bail refused. He appeared again at the Campbelltown Local Court on 16 January 1991 before Mr Kearney SM but was again bail refused. On 23 January 1991 Mr Armati SM at Central Local Court granted bail to the plaintiff. The plaintiff was eventually released on bail on either 25 or 26 January 1991. There are conflicting dates in the documents before me as to when the plaintiff was actually released. There was a requirement to put up a substantial surety which delayed the plaintiff’s being released on bail. Friends of the plaintiff offered as surety the title deeds to their home. It was a requirement of the plaintiff’s bail initially to report to the Campbelltown Police Station. It appears that at first that was daily, if not, almost daily, but the frequency of the need to report was subsequently altered. The plaintiff told me, and I can accept, that reporting to Campbelltown Police Station, a place where he had worked and at which he was well known, which was in the area in which he lived and was very close to his favourite watering hole, would be embarrassing. 61 On 14 March 1991 the departmental complaint concerning the plaintiff was before the then Chief Judge, his Honour Judge Staunton. The Police Service withdrew the complaint, no doubt because the plaintiff was facing much more serious charges which, if proven, would have a greater effect on the plaintiff’s police career that an allegation of drinking whilst he was supposed to be on duty. On 8 October 1991 the committal hearing began before Mr Heaghney SM at the Downing Centre Local Court. On 24 December 1992, over a year later, the learned Magistrate ruled that there was a prima facie case established against each defendant. There were essentially two counts against each defendant of conspiracy relating to the growing of a marijuana plantation on the South Coast of New South Wales. As I have already mentioned the street value of that crop was estimated to be $8.5 million dollars.62 The case for the defence opened before the learned Magistrate on 28 July 1993. The plaintiff himself gave evidence between 17 and 19 August 1993. On 19 December 1993 the plaintiff and Mr Treacy were formally discharged by the learned Magistrate. I do know that all the alleged conspirators were discharged so it would appear that the other alleged conspirators were discharged at some other time. As far as the plaintiff was concerned there had been ninety-five sitting days over a period of some twenty-three weeks, and the committal went over a period of two years and some six weeks.63 On 23 December 1993 the Magistrate awarded costs to the plaintiff against the Crown. The Magistrate made the same order in favour of Mr Treacy. The Director of Public Prosecutions appealed against those costs orders. On 1 February 1994 the appeal against the costs order made in favour of Mr Treacy was dismissed by his Honour Judge Johnston. As a result of his dismissing Mr Treacy’s appeal, the Director of Public Prosecutions withdrew the appeal against the costs order in favour of the plaintiff. On 9 February 1994 the plaintiff’s solicitors were, however, advised by letter from the Director of Public Prosecutions that an ex officio indictment was to be filed. On 16 March 1994 an ex officio indictment was filed. 64 The first two charges were laid against William Alfred Treacy, Wolodymyr Holovinsky, Mark Leonard Gravener, David John Ross, Scott Brian Williams and Harvey Raymond Jenkins. The first charge was that between 1 September 1990 and 28 December 1990 at Yowrie and other places in the state of New South Wales, they did conspire amongst themselves and divers others to cultivate a number of prohibited plants (namely, cannabis plants) not less than the large commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited plant. The second charge was in the alternative that between 1 September 1990 and 28 December 1990 at Yowrie in the state of New South Wales, they did knowingly take part in the cultivation in the number of prohibited plants (namely cannabis plants) not less than the large commercial quantity applicable to the prohibited plant. The indictment contained a further charge, but that charge was only against the plaintiff. It charged that between 28 September 1990 and 23 December 1990 at Campbelltown and other places in the state of New South Wales did bribe William Robert McDougall, a public officer (namely, a constable of police), in that he did corruptly offer money to the said Robert William McDougall in his official capacity and did maintain and increase that offer, in order to incline the said Robert William McDougall to act contrary to his duty as a constable of police in relation to the investigation of offences involving the cultivation of prohibited plants.65 On 19 May 1994 the plaintiff was arraigned on that indictment and pleaded not guilty. The trial commenced before his Honour Judge Gibson and a jury on 8 May 1995. That trial finished on 29 November 1995 when the jury acquitted the plaintiff of all three charges against him and acquitted all the alleged co-conspirators of each charge against them. 66 On 29 January 1996 the plaintiff was reinstated to full duties, however he was never to return to work. He remained on sick leave. On 1 March 1996 the plaintiff made a claim for hurt on duty benefits. On 3 September 1996 the plaintiff applied for a medical discharge. He had then completed twenty-three years of service. Before there was any decision on the claim for hurt on duty benefits and the claim for medical discharge, the plaintiff was served on 22 January 1997 with a notice under s 181D of the Police Act 1990. On 10 February 1997 the defendant determined that the plaintiff’s absences from work since 29 January 1996 were not caused by his having been hurt on duty. On 13 March 1997 the plaintiff appeared before the Commissioner’s advisory panel. Six days later on 19 March 1997 the Commissioner issued an order under s 181D of the Police Act, effectively dismissing the plaintiff from his office of a sergeant of police. The plaintiff did nothing about that immediately. 67 In December 1997 the SAS Trustee Corporation, essentially the administrator of the Act, advised the plaintiff that it was unable to process his application for medical discharge whilst he was “dismissed”. On 23 July 1999, over 18 months later, the plaintiff made an application to the Supreme Court to quash the order under s 181D. That application was made by summons. That action in the Supreme Court was settled on 7 March 2000. Effectively the defendant, the Commissioner of Police, withdrew the order under s 181D on condition that the plaintiff submit his resignation with effect from 19 March 1997. The plaintiff tendered that resignation and accordingly the order under s 181D was withdrawn. On 27 September 2000 the Police Superannuation Advisory Committee made the determination which I outlined at the commencement of these reasons for judgment. On 9 October 2000 the Commissioner of Police made the determination which this appeal concerns. One can see from the chronology that I have just given that much has happened since the second half of 1990, the period during which I must be concerned about the compensability of the plaintiff’s certified infirmity.68 The first of the two matters I should discuss before turning to a detailed consideration of events in the second half of 1990 concerns the reliability and trustworthiness of the plaintiff. In his evidence-in-chief to me the plaintiff told me that prior to 1979 he was “a very heavy drinker”. He told me that he would drink during work hours and after work. He was also asked his drinking habits in the period between 1979 and 1990. He told me he was drinking between fifteen and twenty schooners of beer a day. He told me that he was drinking beer during work hours and after working hours. The plaintiff was asked whether he made any attempts to improve his drinking habits after his absence from work during August and September 1990 and after he had been involved in the motor vehicle accident which led to the loss of his driver’s licence. The plaintiff said that he could not recall making any such attempt. In cross-examination the plaintiff admitted that his alcohol consumption had affected his faculties over his time as a serving police officer. He agreed that it affected his memory. He was asked some questions about evidence he had given at his criminal trial. He agreed that he had answered yes the question that by being a heavy drinker he would find it hard to recall discussions. He agreed that he had answered positively a question that drinking clouds memory as to things that happen when one is either drunk or half drunk. The plaintiff also agreed in his evidence before me that at no stage during his police career did he have any treatment for his alcohol dependency, and he agreed that his memory had been affected by his alcohol intake. 69 Later the plaintiff agreed that alcohol had been a large problem for him throughout his years in the police force, going back as far as 1973. He agreed that he would readily consume twenty to twenty-five schooners of beer a day. He agreed that there were times when he had a memory blackout. The following evidence was given on 14 December 2004 at p 259: 
     
      
      “Q. A memory blackout is when you wake up one morning and say - what did I do last night, I can’t remember?  
       
       A. I’ve had plenty of them.  
      
     
     
      
      Q. You had plenty of them?  
       
      A. Yes.” 
      
    70 It will be clear from my detailed discussion of events in 1990 that the plaintiff was clearly affected by alcohol on many occasions. Indeed one could almost say that the events of the second half of 1990 occurred in an alcoholic miasma. The fact that the plaintiff was often intoxicated and often had memory blackouts indicates that he would have very little accurate recall of events that were happening to him when he was drinking so heavily in the second half of 1990. The plaintiff’s alcohol consumption during late 1990 indicates that his evidence is likely to be unreliable, the subject of reconstruction. The plaintiff has clearly sought to minimise the effect of his alcohol intake in the past. For example in December 1979 the plaintiff admitted that he was a heavy drinker. In 1979 the plaintiff said that he was smoking approximately eighty cigarettes a day. On 19 December 1979 or shortly prior thereto, the plaintiff saw Dr Raymond Garrick, a consultant neurologist. That followed upon the plaintiff’s being assaulted on 24 October 1979 by Aborigines. The doctor took the usual history from Mr Holovinsky. The doctor recorded that the plaintiff smoked more than twenty cigarettes daily but drank alcohol only on social occasions. The plaintiff admitted lying to Dr Garrick. The plaintiff clearly lied to Inspector Braid and Chief Inspector Lammiman about drinking alcohol in January 1990.71 I must also, when I consider the reliability of the plaintiff’s evidence, take into account how this case was conducted and how the evidence was progressing before the plaintiff made certain concessions. The plaintiff’s affidavit was sworn on 30 April 2004. In para 6 of that affidavit the plaintiff refers to the suicide of a fourteen year old girl who had hung herself in a tree. The plaintiff deposed to often having nightmares of her face appearing before him, and that those dreams or nightmares were continuing up until the present time. The plaintiff said in his affidavit “It was these types of stress related incidents that caused me to resort to drinking alcohol as an escape in which I found tended to relieve my stress somewhat”. That observation of the plaintiff is self serving. The only evidence about alcohol intake in this matter is from Dr Champion who points out that it is multi factorial and rather than being a reliever of stress it was in fact a precipitant of stress. The allegation of the need to take alcohol to relieve stress is one that I constantly hear when sitting in the Special Statutory Compensation List. However one must realise that many people find drinking pleasurable. It is patently clear when one goes to the events of 1990 that the plaintiff thought that drinking alcohol was a good thing and it was a marvellous thing if one could organise to have a good drinking session.72 In the seventh paragraph of his affidavit, the plaintiff said that in about 1975 he recalled attending another suicide where a young male had hung himself on his front door. He said that that had even worse effect upon him than the earlier suicide of the fourteen year old girl. At that time the plaintiff said he was only ten years older than the man who had committed suicide, and that caused the plaintiff to remember the travails of his teenage years. The plaintiff then complained about having no counselling and that he had to “put up a brave front, being a policeman”. The plaintiff, in para 9 of his affidavit, refers to the events of the White Bay Hotel where he would meet up with prospective buyers of allegedly stolen goods at a hotel. The scheme was to detect those having goods in custody. The plaintiff gave evidence of becoming at one stage stranded from his backup. He said this in his affidavit: 
     
      
      “I became immediately aware that I was on my own, and there was no backup. I became extremely stressed and anxious as to my safety and kept walking. About the same time, the police backup vehicle arrived and arrested the offender. This had quite a serious effect upon me and I have vivid recollections of returning to Drummoyne Police Station and drinking quantities of alcohol in an effort to calm myself down”. 
      
    In para 10 of his affidavit the plaintiff said this: 
     
      
      “During my service at Blacktown I recall attending the location of the body of a murder victim (Joe Borg) at Doonside. At this time the body was in a state of severe decomposition. The stench was overbearing. I recall being violently ill at the scene and the memory of this picture remains with me to this day”. 
      
    73 The evidence establishes that the body of the deceased was in a garage which the plaintiff did not enter. The plaintiff got not closer to the building than twenty-five metres, although it may have been as far a distance as forty metres. The plaintiff did not see it at all. The plaintiff merely smelt the odour of the decaying body. However when the plaintiff saw Dr Wendy Walker there was a vivid description of this event where the plaintiff told the doctor of seeing the maggots emerging from the rotting corpse and the like. Clearly this is a matter of gross exaggeration. In para 13 of his affidavit the plaintiff records that on 24 October 1979 whilst walking to Redfern Railway Station after completing his shift, he was set upon by a group of Aborigines, severely beaten about the head and body and knocked unconscious. The plaintiff deposed that that caused him to become paranoid, “particularly with Aboriginals”. He then makes a complaint of not receiving support from the police or counselling and of receiving no emotional support. Of course it was that event that caused the plaintiff to see Dr Garrick. Again this whole event was given in an exaggerated form by the plaintiff at one stage with a fabulous, and I mean fabulous literally, description of what his fears were after that event. 74 In para 16 of his affidavit the plaintiff refers to the investigation of rapes. Again in his affidavit the plaintiff refers to suffering from numerous flashbacks to the events which he had to investigate which continued for some time. In para 17 the plaintiff refers to his part in investigating the Milperra Fathers Day Massacre. The final sentence of para 17 in the affidavit is this: 
     
      
      “Following my part in the investigation of the Father’s Day Massacre, I have had a number of dreams where Bikies would come into my home and take captive my wife and children. These dreams were a direct result of having taken part in that investigations”. 
      
    The plaintiff’s involvement in the investigation of the Milperra massacre was canvassed at some length in cross-examination. It became abundantly clear that the plaintiff was a “bit player”, if anything, in the investigation of that event. There was no direct threat made by anybody to the plaintiff. There were only general threats. The plaintiff was not involved in arresting anybody, merely in making inquiries and witnessing statements and the like. His role was a minor one, and if there were to be reprisals by members of a biker gang, he would be one of the least likely targets.75 Paras 21 to 23 of the affidavit need to be considered. They are these: 
     
      
      “21. On the various occasions that I might attend a murder scene or other serious type of crime during part of my investigation, I found such investigations to be extremely stressful and I bottle up my emotions. This resulted in me not wanting to discuss such events with my wife for fear of upsetting her and I would resort to drinking alcohol to settle this anxiety and stress. During my years of service, I would constantly find myself attending the local hotel with other officers almost on a daily basis after the end of the shift and often during a shift. This was the only way I knew how to give vent to my emotions and feelings. At least you could talk to your buddies about case you were dealing with, particularly after a successful investigation of a serious matter. 
      
     
     
      
      22. During the later 1980s and throughout most of the 1990s, my wife would tell me about my restlessness during the night. She would say to me ‘You must have been having a nightmare through the night, you were roaring out loud and your body was trembling’. I recall that on many occasions I have awoken in a lather of sweat only to realise that I was having a nightmare. These nightmares still occur to the present day. 
      
     
     
      
      23. During the entire course of employment with the New South Wales Police, I was never afforded any counselling following my involvement in traumatic events and incidents which involved high stress levels such as those recounted above. As a result, the problems I was suffering from, were not being addressed and were continually building up within me like a volcano.” 
      
    76 As to the symptoms noticed by the plaintiff’s wife, they may of course be applicable to alcohol withdrawal. It is clear to me that the plaintiff asks me to believe that his alcohol consumption, his alcohol habit, was caused by his reaction to his work, but that is completely inconsistent with the opinion of Dr Champion, and of course the plaintiff’s substance abuse or alcoholism is not a certified infirmity. However, it appears to me that the plaintiff was prepared, in this affidavit, to exaggerate excessively the effects of events upon him when it is clear that the only complaints he initially made to medical practitioners prior to seeing Dr Walker all arose from his being arrested and charged on 31 December 1990.77 Paragraphs 25 and 26 of the affidavit are these: 
     
      
      “On 22 August 1990, I attended once again upon Dr Phillip Guest in respect of insomnia, diarrhoea and feeling tense. Dr Guest prescribed an anti-depressant, Prothiaden, and referred me to Mr Glancey for counselling. 
      
     
     
      
      26. On 23 August 1990, while stationed at Newtown police station I went off work suffering from stress. The anxiety, stress, depression, lack of counselling and resort to suffering drinking alcohol had built up to a point such that I felt rejected by the Police Service.” 
      
    78 What the plaintiff failed to tell me in those paragraphs were firstly that on 22 August 1990, when he saw Dr Guest, his complaint was about the pending department inquiry which would lead to the Departmental charge. That Departmental charge had its basis in facts which had nothing to do with the plaintiff’s police service. I may have expressed myself elliptically. The Departmental charge arose out of an allegation the plaintiff was drinking whilst on duty. Clearly he was drinking when he was supposed to be on duty but that drinking was not in the course of the execution of the duties of his office. It was while he was supposed to be on duty, not whilst he was actually doing his duty. If the plaintiff was upset about the Departmental charge it had nothing to do with his work.79 In paragraph 26 the plaintiff coyly omits to tell me that on 23 August 1990 he played golf, went to the clubhouse, consumed an immense amount of alcohol and then was involved in a motor vehicle accident which resulted in his being charged and convicted of a high range PCA offence.80 I must take into account, in considering the plaintiff’s credibility, the lies which he told to his superiors about 15 January 1990. The plaintiff admitted in his evidence that he was prepared to lie, to use his words, “to cover his arse”. A consideration of the plaintiff’s original “stress claim” clearly indicates to me that he was prepared to exaggerate and invent. 81 The plaintiff also admitted in cross-examination that he had “bent the rules” over the years of his police service. He admitted, for example, that he would routinely, when he was a detective, make entries in his duty book which were a routine entry of his having done things which he would not do. The plaintiff was not only prepared to bend the rules, he was also prepared to make false entries.82 The plaintiff had commenced to work for a licensed premises about which I shall have much to say in either 1985 or 1986. He worked in those premises as a barman on Sundays. The plaintiff had no written permission to undertake such secondary employment. The plaintiff knew that he was required to have written permission to perform that work. There are, in evidence, numerous documents relating to secondary employment. Working as a barman in an hotel was permitted provided that permission was obtained and provided the establishment or licensed premises was suitable as far as the Commissioner of Police was concerned. The plaintiff worked from 1985 or 1986 to 1990 in those licensed premises without written permission and therefore in breach of the Police Rules at the time. The plaintiff’s attitude to not obtaining the permission was blasé. He said that everyone knew that he was working there, even his superiors, but that of course does not excuse the plaintiff from obtaining the necessary permission.83 The inferences I draw from these considerations are these. Firstly, that the plaintiff’s memory for any detail of events the second half of 1990 is likely to be extremely poor. Secondly, the plaintiff is liable to exaggerate and embellish for his own purposes, and if necessary to tell lies to further his own position or achieve his own ends. 84 That leads me to a further consideration on this issue. The plaintiff made no written records whatever of what he was doing or saying in August to December in 1990. He has tendered no written documents about the events into which I must inquire. 85 The committal proceedings commenced on 8 December 1991 and on 24 December 1992 the learned magistrate found a prima facie case. The plaintiff then knew what the defendant’s case was on the criminal charges and had time to consider his reply to the Prosecution case. The plaintiff did not have to outline his defence until the defence case started on 28 July 1993 and in particular until he commenced giving evidence on 17 August 1993. The plaintiff had a long time to prepare his story to answer the Prosecution case. I must be acutely aware that the plaintiff may have reconstructed events to suit the Prosecution case or alternatively crafted a case in answer to the Prosecution case which might exculpate him.86 The plaintiff, of course, would probably have had an even longer period of time than the time taken during the committal hearing to consider the documentary case prepared by the police in the prosecution of him which is directly referable to the matters with which I have to deal. I therefore approach the plaintiff’s evidence with great caution. 87 Before I turn to the next area I shall take an adjournment.88 I turn now to the second consideration about the reliability of the evidence for me. The principal witness called against the plaintiff in the criminal proceedings was Detective Senior Constable Robert McDougall. It was he whom the plaintiff was alleged to have attempted to bribe. It is clear that Detective Senior Constable McDougall, to whom I shall refer hereafter to merely as McDougall, without any discourtesy meant to him, was cross-examined at some length, both at the committal and at the trial. I have carefully read the evidence given by Mr McDougall at the trial. He was certainly cross-examined repeatedly and thoroughly and aggressively by Mr Somosi of counsel who was then appearing for the plaintiff and Treacy.89 Various attempts were made by the defendant to have McDougall attend court on a subpoena. Eventually I made an order requiring him to attend before me on Monday 7 August 2006 or to show cause why he should not be dealt with for contempt. On the morning of 7 August 2006 Mr McDougall appeared and made an application to be excused from giving evidence. I made a ruling on the morning of 7 August 2006 which has been transcribed. Having regard to what had been put before me by Mr McDougall I had to consider the matters raised in Chapter 2 Division 1 of the Evidence Act 1995. I ruled that Mr McDougall was compellable. However, I then drew the attention of Mr McDougall and counsel and the plaintiff to the provisions of s 41 of the Evidence Act which gives me power to disallow questions which were unduly annoying, harassing, intimidating, offensive, oppressive or repetitive. I also can take into account under s 41 any mental, intellectual or physical disability which the witness may be subject to.90 After I gave that judgment the transcript records Mr McDougall as saying this: 
     
      
      “Your Honour, with all due respect I appreciate your considerations here today, but I ain’t giving evidence, in fact I’m going out the door right now. I refuse to hurt myself because of a grub like that and grubs like these two.” 
      
    91 When McDougall said “a grub like that” he gestured towards the plaintiff. When he said “grubs like these two” he gestured at senior counsel for the plaintiff and senior counsel for the defendant. He promptly left the Court.92 Eventually, an application was made by the plaintiff for me to issue a warrant for Mr McDougall’s arrest and for him to show cause why he should not be prosecuted for contempt. I refused those applications. It was clear that Mr McDougall was not the plaintiff’s witness and the only person who is entitled to insist on the enforcement of the subpoena was the defendant who had served the subpoena upon the witness and who wished to call him.93 In my view, the Court was not held in contempt by Mr McDougall, albeit that counsel were insulted, as was the plaintiff. I allowed time for the defendant to obtain instructions. The ruling I made on the application by the plaintiff concerning Mr McDougall was made on 8 August 2006 and has been transcribed.94 On 14 August 2006 the defendant made an application for admission of documents made by McDougall in the process of his investigation of an approach that had been made to him by the plaintiff to be admitted into evidence under either s 63 or s 64 of the Evidence Act. I considered that application and ruled that the documents were admissible under s 64(2) of the Evidence Act, noting the consent of the defendant to the tender of the transcripts of evidence given by McDougall in the criminal proceedings if the plaintiff wished to do so. All such documents have been put into evidence. I do not wish, at this stage, to rehearse all the matters I considered in my ruling on 14 August 2006. I shall merely seek to summarise it so that anyone reading these reasons for judgment when they have been transcribed knows what occurred. 95 McDougall himself made applications for sick leave and hurt on duty benefits because of his involvement in the investigation of the plaintiff and his giving evidence in the prosecution of the plaintiff. Eventually he was medically discharged for inter alia a psychiatric condition which was in part, at least, referable to the trauma which he says he experienced in investigating the plaintiff and in giving evidence in the prosecution. It also emerged that Mr McDougall himself had his own problems with stress and in much of the period in later 1990 with which I am concerned he was absent from duty on sick report and was drinking excessive amounts of alcohol. McDougall himself was cross-examined about that in the criminal proceedings. In re-examination McDougall gave this evidence: 
     
      
      “Q. You were also asked a number of questions concerning your absences from work on sick report between 2 November and sometime in December, do you remember that? 
       
      A. Yes. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. What was your reason for going on sick report? 
       
      A. A decision was made by the superintendent who was the officer in charge of the Illawarra region, that I stay on sick report and concentrate solely on this matter and not be tired up with other everyday duties. 
       
       
      Q. Were you sick during that period? 
       
      A. No, I wasn’t sick. I had been recalled to duty on a number of occasions and was being paid overtime, so I wasn’t sick.” 
      
    96 Mr Somosi was granted leave to further cross-examine McDougall. In that further cross-examination McDougall admitted to answering a number of questions on this very issue at the committal proceedings. At that time McDougall had referred to stress that was brought on him by the inquiry into the plaintiff’s activities and also stress that was being applied to him by the Police Service to engage in the investigation of the plaintiff. Mr McDougall also confirmed evidence he had given at committal about seeing a psychologist, Mr Glancey, during the period that he was on sick report. He was then asked to explain what he meant, when he said that he was not sick in re-examination. This evidence was given: 
     
      
      “Q. You weren’t sick? 
       
      A. Stress is not something you lay on your back kicking your legs or wear your wife’s clothes around the house. It is something in the back of your mind which sometimes effects you more than others. Obviously I was suffering from stress but through Mr Glancey and the relaxation tapes I was in control of it.  
      
     
     
      
      Q. You weren’t sick? 
       
      A. I was on sick report and at times I was sick, I admit that, but stress is a thing that is easily controlled.” 
      
    97 McDougall was then asked about claiming Workcover benefits. It would appear that Mr Somosi was unaware of the provisions of the Police Regulation (Superannuation) Act 1906 and the hurt on duty scheme. However, Mr McDougall admitted to filling in the appropriate forms to claim benefits in respect of his absences from work. In other words, it was offered essentially by Mr McDougall that he was not really sick when he was saying that he was. However, I maintain the reasons I gave on the defendant’s application for the admission of McDougall’s documents under the Evidence Act. McDougall was sick. He was obtaining treatment. He was drinking excessive amounts of alcohol and at times his workmates said that he was irrational.98 The end result is, that Mr McDougall has not given evidence before me and I have not been able to form any opinion of his evidence based on his character or demeanour. Furthermore, there are a number of inconsistencies, if not glaring inconsistencies in his evidence which must cast doubt on his reliability as a witness.99 The weight which I can give to Mr McDougall’s evidence must be attenuated by the fact that he bluntly refused to give evidence before me and did not give evidence. He perceived that it would cause him a further outbreak of illness. He had a recurrent major depressive illness, and that might well have been the case. However, whether it were the case could only be ascertained if he tried to give evidence, which he did not wish to do. The weight to be given to his evidence must be further attenuated by his trying to establish in re-examination the fact that he was not sick when I have found him to have been sick.100 The only judicial officer to have seen and heard Mr McDougall giving evidence and to have published reasons about Mr McDougall’s evidence is the learned magistrate Mr Heaghney. The appeal on the costs order to his Honour Judge Johnston was a re-hearing on paper. The credibility of McDougall at the trial was a matter for the jury to determine and juries do not give reasons. Equally, there may have been some, perhaps, pertinent remarks about that issue by the learned trial judge, Judge Gibson, but his summing up to the jury has not been put before me.101 In considering McDougall’s evidence, I must be guided to a large extent by the observations of Mr Heaghney. For example, on page 4 of his reasons Mr Heaghney said this: 
     
      
      “A careful perusal of the transcripts of the recorded conversations and a careful listening to the recordings themselves, together with a consideration of certain other matters have led me to conclude that the version of the September meeting given by Detective Senior Constable McDougall is scarcely believable.” 
      
    102 On page 8 of his reasons for judgment the learned magistrate said this: 
     
      
      “I have already said something in one context about the conversation at the Burwood RSL of 22 November 1990 in a more general vein the defendant McDougall’s evidence that the versions of these conversations which he has given in his evidence are pretty much word for word is plainly ridiculous especially in respect of this conversation which on his own evidence was a long one. Because these unrecorded conversations as opposed [deposed] to by Senior Constable McDougall do not sit well with the recorded conversations and because the omission from them of material to be found in a number of police information and surveillance reports they must be regarded in my view as having little reliability.” 
      
    103 The weight I can give to the evidence in documentary form from McDougall must be diminished in light of his refusal to undergo cross-examination before me and must carry little weight or reduced weight because I have not had an opportunity to observe him. 104 Of these two considerations of course the adverse inferences I draw about the reliability of the plaintiff favours the defendant’s case and equally the adverse inferences to be drawn from Mr McDougall’s evidence favours the plaintiff’s case. I must approach all the evidence cautiously and carefully and in the end result apply commonsense.105 I turn now to a detailed consideration of the events of 1990. I first need to describe a few things. The first are two loci. The first is licensed premises at Campbelltown. These licensed premises are opposite the Campbelltown courthouse. There once stood on that site an hotel known as Lack’s Hotel. That building appears to have been demolished and replaced by a new building which houses, amongst other things, a tavern which I understands to have the formal name of the Court Tavern. This was often referred to as the new Court Tavern and sometimes that has been transcribed as the New Court Tavern as if the novelty of the establishment was a part of its name. I suspect that it obtained the moniker “new” because it replaced the original hotel. There are references in the transcripts to both new Court Tavern, New Court Tavern, Lack’s Hotel, and Lack’s and “the Pub”. All those are in general references to what I will merely describe as the Court Tavern or the Tavern. 106 The Tavern was described by McDougall in his evidence at trial as being a “policemen’s meeting place”. The Tavern is the place at which Mr Holovinsky worked as a barman on Sunday afternoons since 1985 and 1986. When the plaintiff was released on bail he was stood down from duty but paid his basic salary of office. In order to cover legal costs he needed other employment and as I understand it took full time employment at the Tavern. The Tavern is, as I said, opposite the Campbelltown courthouse. One needs only walk across a public street. I am prepared to take judicial notice of the fact that Campbelltown police station is one block from Campbelltown courthouse, having sat regularly at Campbelltown courthouse in recent times and driven past the police station to get to the courthouse.107 The other locus to which I need describe is a locality on the South Coast of New South Wales known as Yowrie. Yowrie is nineteen kilometres northwest of Cobargo. Cobargo is a village located on the Princes Highway roughly midway between Narooma and Bega. The Yowrie River runs through the locality of Yowrie into the Wadbilliga River which itself is a tributary of the Tuross River. Most of the road from Cobargo to Yowrie is unsealed. That unsealed road continues in to the Wadbilliga National Park. The Wadbilliga National Park is very close to Yowrie, on its western side. On the coast of New South Wales, about twelve kilometres south of Narooma is a place known as Mystery Bay which is immediately north of Cape Dromedary. Cape Dromedary was named by Captain Cook as well as the nearby Mt Dromedary. Whether it was Captain Cook who named Mystery Bay is a mystery to me. From Mystery Bay to Cobargo is a distance of approximately twenty-seven kilometres. Accordingly, from Mystery Bay to Yowrie is a distance of forty-six kilometres. One datum in this case is that there were cannabis plantations growing in the locality of Yowrie. 108 The evidence before me contains a statement made by Detective Senior Sergeant Robert Charles Anderson of the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). That tells me that at 5am on Friday 28 December 1990 Anderson attended a briefing at the Bega police station. Following upon that briefing, Anderson, with other police, went to the Yowrie area. A group of police went to an area near Russells Creek where Anderson saw an area cleared of trees and surrounded by wire in which a large number of cannabis plants were growing. A short time later Anderson, with other detectives, went to an area west of the creek where there was another area cleared of trees. That area was surrounded by netting and contained a large plot of cannabis plants covered by netting and two smaller plots of cannabis plants. At another time, Anderson went with other detectives to a third area which was surrounded by netting and contained a large number of cannabis plants. It appears that all of these plantations were being actively irrigated. As I have already stated the estimated street value of the cannabis was some $8.5 million. When exactly the police received the intelligence as to the whereabouts of the cannabis plants I currently am unaware. A document I have read suggests it was Christmas Day 1990. It matters little. All that need be known is that the crops - and I use that word in the plural advisedly - were discovered in late December 1990.109 One of the co-accused of the plaintiff was Mr Mark Leonard Gravener. Mr Gravener had a farm at Yowrie on which was grown asparagus. I do not know whether the asparagus covered the whole of Mr Gravener’s holding, although the evidence suggests to me that it did not cover the whole of his holding. One would have thought if one knows anything of the history of the South Coast of New South Wales that originally the area was a dairy farming area. How close to Mr Gravener’s holding the plantations were the evidence does not disclose. The evidence certainly does not prove that the plantations were on Mr Gravener’s property. 110 In late August or early September there was a meeting at the Tavern which was attended by the plaintiff, Mr William Alfred Treacy and Mr Rod Moore. I have already adverted to the fact that Mr Treacy and the plaintiff attended Merrylands Primary School and Merrylands High School together. In his evidence before me Mr Treacy pointed out that after leaving school the plaintiff was to join the Police Force and Mr Treacy was to become a criminal. In fact Mr Treacy described himself in his evidence as a criminal. It appears from his criminal record that Mr Treacy turned to crime at a very young age. His first appearance was before the Metropolitan Children’s Court on 22 January 1964 for an offence of discharging a firearm in a public place. The penalty imposed at that time was a fine of five pounds or ten days detention. I am sure that anybody who discharged a firearm in a public place at the current time would be glad to received such a penalty. He appeared in the Parramatta Children’s Court in February and again in January and February of 1964 and was convicted of stealing offences. On 3 March 1964 he appeared in Campbelltown Children’s Court on a charge of malicious injury when he was given a good behaviour bond. Within two months he was before the Parramatta Children’s Court for offences of stealing and offensive behaviour. In 1965 there were charges of stealing, larceny, offensive behaviour, driving whilst unlicensed and driving negligently and of breaking, entering and stealing, and finally of culpable driving for which he received a sentence of three years hard labour. The first full time custodial offence had been imposed by the Glebe Local Court on 17 March 1969. That was for four months. Sentences of six months hard labour and fifteen months hard labour had been imposed at the Parramatta Quarter Sessions on 23 June 1965. 111 Treacy appeared before Parramatta Quarter Sessions on 19 June 1968 and was sentenced to three years penal servitude on each of two counts of breaking, entering and stealing. There were two other counts of breaking, entering and stealing for which additional cumulative periods of imprisonment were imposed. Apparently, at some stage, Treacy escaped from gaol and committed more offences. On 7 November 1968 the Parramatta Quarter Sessions imposed sentences of imprisonment for attempting to escape from lawful custody, malicious damage to property, breaking, entering and stealing, larceny and escaping from lawful custody. Those sentences appear to have kept Treacy out of mischief until he appeared in the Sydney District Court on 23 August 1973 and was sentenced to eight years penal servitude for robbery under arms. A three year non-parole period was fixed, however in 1974 he was convicted on further offences of forgery and uttering. Perhaps they occurred whilst he was in gaol. Treacy would have been released from imprisonment in 1976. Between that time and 1987 Treacy’s offences were merely in relation to traffic matters. 112 On 2 July 1987 he was extradited to appear in the Southport Magistrate’s Court on 3 July 1987. For whatever he was charged when he was in Queensland he was found not guilty. On 27 February 1990 Treacy was charged with possessing a prohibited article and possessing an unlicensed pistol. For those offences he was committed for trial in the Sydney West District Court. On 27 February 1990 he was convicted at Campbelltown of assault and of being an unlicensed driver. The fine imposed for the assault was $400 so it could not have been a major offence. However, on 13 July 1999 he was committed for sentence to the South West District Court on a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. For at least one of the offences for which he was committed for trial or sentence in early 1990 Treacy appeared for sentence before this Court at Campbelltown in December 1990 and that will be pointed out during the examination events in that month. 113 Since being discharged by the jury in November 1995 Treacy has been convicted of a further offence. That offence was of conspiring to manufacture amphetamines and was recorded in 1998. Treacy was given a non-parole period of four years and two months and a head sentence of five years and six months. It is understandable why Mr Treacy referred to himself as a criminal.114 Since leaving school, the inference to be drawn from the evidence is that Treacy and the plaintiff had met only irregularly and accidentally. There is references to them meeting each at the golf club or at the pub, or passing each other in the street, or at the shops. They lived in the same area. At relevant times Mr Holovinsky was living at St Andrews and Mr Treacy was living at Ruse. Both of those are suburbs in the Campbelltown area as I understand it. 115 The best that counsel have been able to do to establish when the meeting occurred, which I am currently discussing, was some time in early September 1990, perhaps between 7 and 10 September 1990. Both the plaintiff and Treacy have given evidence to me about this matter and the evidence at trial of Mr Rod Moore about this meeting has also been put before me. There appears to be no dispute what was discussed. Mr Treacy relayed the fact that he had a friend down the South Coast near Cobargo who had a farm. That friend was clearly Gravener, although his name was never mentioned. Treacy told the plaintiff that his friend had seen Henry Charles Landini and some of his mates in the bushland at the back of his property and that his mate and Treacy believed that Landini and his friends were involved in growing a marijuana crop. 116 The plaintiff gave this evidence: 
     
      
      “Q. Did Billy Treacy say anything about what he wanted you to do in terms of dealing with this information? 
       
      A. Well, it was only an inference that he wanted something done about Landini. He also told me that day that there’s no point going to the DEA because the fellow who told him about it when he put Landini in or told the DEA about Landini on the last occasion, his place was turned over and he didn’t trust the DEA. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. Were you told anything about [where] Landini lived? 
       
      A. Yes, he lived down at Mystery Bay somewhere. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. Where was Mystery Bay according to your understanding? 
       
      A. Down the South Coast.” 
      
    117 It appears to have been conveyed at the meeting that Gravener had previously had a dealing with Landini and had confronted him and was scared of him. Gravener had made a complaint to the local police which ended up in the State Drug Crime Commission causing there to be a raid on Gravener’s property, being the execution of a search warrant. Whether it was actually discussed or merely inferred is difficult to know, but it seems that Gravener was afraid of making a further complaint to the local police about Landini. Henry Charles Landini could, on the evidence presented to me, be described as a major criminal. He was known to be a murderer, an extortionist, a drug dealer and a person known to effect what are called “rip-offs”, meaning stealing other persons’ illegal drugs.118 The evidence of Moore confirms that Treacy had a mate at Cobargo and that that mate was terrified of Landini; that Landini had been seen at the back of his property there over a period of two years; that the mate and Treacy suspected that Landini was growing cannabis there; that Landini had in the past tied up and robbed a man who had a nursery at Bega; that the mate at Cobargo was in fear of Landini and was frightened for his family; that the mate at Cobargo had gone to the police; that the police had come out and raided the mate’s place and nothing had happened to Landini; and that Landini lived in Mystery Bay.119 In his evidence, Mr Treacy said this: 
     
      
      “Q. In about august 1990 did Gravener ask you to do something? 
       
      A. He asked me if I could do anything about the situation, that he’s frightened that Danny Landini might come to his house, or he might be doing something that would get him into trouble. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. What did you do? 
       
      A. I spoke to Fred Holovinsky about it.” 
      
    Further on in his evidence in chief, Mr Treacy told me that he told the plaintiff that Landini was living in Mystery Bay and that there would be a situation where Landini would travel down to the Cobargo area. In cross-examination Treacy said that Gravener wanted Treacy to get Landini to “drop off”, that is, to stay away from Gravener’s property. 120 Treacy had given evidence at trial that perhaps Landini could be followed and that would resolve the situation in so much as Landini would know that he was being followed. He agreed that he thought that Landini was being protected by the local police. He said that he thought that Landini would care if he was being followed by the State Drug Crime Commission, by the Federal Police, by the DEA or by lots of people. He went on to say this: 
     
      
      “Q. What made you believe that Landini would care if he suspected he was under police surveillance? 
       
      A. I think Landini - living in a country town and having country police, is a lot different from being followed by police from Sydney. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. So you believe that Landini would be more concerned about police from a major crime squad in Sydney coming down to keep an eye on him rather than by the locals? 
       
      A. That’s correct. That’s correct.” 
      
    121 A few questions later he was asked whether his view when he approached Mr Holovinsky was to organise some sort of surveillance. Mr Treacy’s answer to that question was that Mr Holovinsky, the plaintiff, would pass the information on to the New South Wales Drug Squad.122 It is noted that Mr Treacy stated that whenever he met the plaintiff it would be fair to say that the plaintiff was “half-tanked”. That was the proposition put by learned senior counsel for the defendant with which the witness agreed. I understand Ms Stenmark to have meant by that the plaintiff had drunk a fair amount of alcohol and was at least half intoxicated.123 The inferences to be drawn from the evidence are that Treacy conveyed to Holovinsky intelligence that Landini, who had an alias of “Little Danny” and was sometimes known as Danny Landini, had a cannabis crop near a friend’s property down at Cobargo, that Landini lived at Mystery Bay and could be followed from Mystery Bay to where the crop was at Cobargo and that it would be pointless to ring the local police because the local police were thought to be offering protection to Landini. 124 The concern of Gravener, through Treacy to the plaintiff, was not so much to have Landini arrested, but to warn Landini away from Gravener’s property. If Landini was warned away from Gravener’s property, Gravener would have nothing further to fear. Equally, Landini was such a major criminal that he would probably suspect surveillance and even his suspicion that there was surveillance would be enough to keep him away from Gravener’s property.125 The plaintiff’s case is that when he heard the name of Landini mentioned he was instantly alert, having remembered from his detective’s course that Henry Charles Landini was a major criminal in this State and was always the subject of police inquiries. The plaintiff’s evidence to me is that he thought if he could arrange to have Landini arrested at the cannabis crop site, on the plantation itself, it would be a major coup for the New South Wales Police in having arrested such a notorious criminal and a major coup for the plaintiff himself who could take credit for the arrest of Landini. The plaintiff tells me, and his case is, that he would use the kudos for that arrest to try to have himself re-instated as a detective, which had remained his desire in the Police Force and his preferred career path.126 The mentioning of Landini’s name appears to have had a similar effect on the other person present at the meeting, Rodney George Moore. Mr Moore was, at the time he gave evidence, a self-employed private inquiry agent. He had been in the New South Wales Police Force. He left the New South Wales Police Force in 1986 on medical grounds with the rank of Detective Sergeant. He first met Treacy in this meeting with the plaintiff at the Court Tavern. Mr Moore had known the plaintiff since about 1969 when they had worked together in the Armed Hold-up Squad. 127 Mr Moore’s evidence confirms that when Treacy gave the information about Landini his ears pricked up because when he was in the police, working both the Drug Squad and the Armed Robbery Squad, Landini’s name was one that was constantly in the limelight as being a “heavy criminal”. He had a strong belief of Landini’s reputation as a murderer, an extortionist, a gunman, and being heavily involved in the drug trade, both heroin and Indian hemp. In fact the intelligence gleaned by Moore at this meeting, he was to convey to Detective Sergeant Finch, who was on the DEA. If Landini was arrested from the information he gave to Detective Sergeant Finch, Moore was going to seek a reward. At some later time, probably in November, Mr Moore conveyed to the plaintiff that he had spoken to Detective Sergeant Finch about the information conveyed by Treacy at the meeting, and it is clear that Moore and the plaintiff discussed reward moneys.128 The question is what did the plaintiff do with this intelligence? The plaintiff’s claim is that he passed on this intelligence to Detective Senior Constable McDougall at the Tavern on 21 September 1990. Mr McDougall’s evidence is otherwise. It is otherwise both as to the date of the passing on of the information and as to what the information was. 129 In chief, counsel led from the plaintiff that at the same time that he had this conversation with Treacy and Moore, he had a telephone conversation with McDougall. The inference to be drawn is that it was not at the same time, but some time relatively shortly after the meeting. The plaintiff told me that he was completing records relating to people who had to report to Newtown Police Station as condition of bail. One such person was named Bedek. He had not reported. The plaintiff contacted the police station closest to where Bedek resided and saw that the officer in charge of the matter was McDougall. He left a message for McDougall to contact him in relation to Bedek. The plaintiff said that McDougall phoned him back and that basically the conversation was that McDougall would be “up the pub the following week and he’d see me to have a drink”. He went on to say that he knew McDougall to be working at Warilla Police Station, but the plaintiff told me that he had no idea where Warilla was, meaning that it was down the “south coast” somewhere.130 The plaintiff went on to tell me that on 21 September 1990 he had a conversation with McDougall at the Court Tavern. He confirmed that he had seen McDougall socially on many occasions in the past. In fact the two appeared to have worked together for some short time at Campbelltown. The plaintiff described McDougall as a “big drinker”. That statement may well be self-serving. He also, when asked about Mr McDougall’s behaviour, said this: 
     
      
      “Well, they called him The Crowd. He was the most garrulous big-noter, loud fellow.” 
      
    Again, I must be careful using such evidence because it may well be the result of ex post facto rationalisation.131 The plaintiff went on to tell me this: 
     
      
      “Q. During the time that you were having the conversations with him, what was your state of intoxication and his apparent state of intoxication? 
       
      A. We both would have been well affected. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. Can you tell us what happened in that conversation on 21 September 1990 as best you can, what you said to him? 
       
      A. I said to him that I’ve got a good mate who’s given me some information about Landini, that arsehole Landini, he’s been seen at the back of the bush down behind these blokes’ place and they reckon he’s involved in a crop. I told him that the information was pretty right because it came from a good bloke that I’d known for a long while. I told him to do his homework and it’d be a good pinch. I wrote down on a coaster the name of Henry Charles Landini alias Little Danny and gave it to him.” 
      
    He confirmed that by the words “a good pinch” he meant an arrest and that there would be no better arrest than that of Landini.132 The plaintiff told me that his purpose in passing on that information was to have Landini arrested. He was asked what advantage did he see for himself in giving this information to McDougall and he said this: 
     
      
      “The whole area was governed by promotion by merit and having Landini arrested, me receiving the kudos for it, of being involved in his arrest, I would have hoped it might have given me a better chance of getting back to plain clothes.” 
      
    The plaintiff was then asked why he did not go directly to the DEA and why he gave it to a detective from the South Coast, Wollongong region and the plaintiff said this: 
     
      
      “Well, the last time the DEA were involved they got - this fellow that passed the information on, he was turned over and I thought that if I gave it to McDougall, who I knew to be on the South Coast, he could run the brief from there.” 
      
    In substance, what the plaintiff says he was seeking to do was to give this information to McDougall so that McDougall could do the work necessary to lead to the arrest of Landini. 133 One thing that becomes clear at this hearing is that the plaintiff has the most woeful knowledge of the geography of this State. The only idea that the plaintiff had of where Warilla was, where McDougall was serving, or where Mystery Bay was, or where Cobargo was, and indeed of where Eden was, was that they were all “down the South Coast”. In fact one could be forgiven for thinking that “the South Coast” was yet another suburb of Sydney. I have been perplexed by this lack of geographic knowledge of the State. Is it true or is it feigned? I believe it to be true. In other occasions the plaintiff had no idea where Mystery Bay was and thought it was at Eden. Mystery Bay is a long way from Eden. The plaintiff’s geographical ignorance is a reality, I am afraid, rather than a feigned concoction. The only way in effect that McDougall could do anything with the intelligence was to pass it on to the DEA.134 The version of what happened at this meeting of McDougall and the plaintiff given by McDougall is very different. McDougall says it occurred not on the twenty-first, but on 28 September 1990. The first record that McDougall made of the meeting that he says occurred on 28 September 1990 is recorded in his duty book. Detectives keep duty books, uniformed policemen do not. Both detectives and uniformed policemen have police notebooks which can be used by detectives as well, as they often are by uniformed police. These duty books are not small documents, they are cumbersome and are usually kept at the detective’s office or police station. 135 The first question for me to determine is when the entry for 28 September 1990 was made. It appears to me to be more probable than not that it was made on Thursday 4 October 1990. On that day the duty book records that McDougall was on duty at 8am at Warilla and attended the Local Court at Wollongong concerning Bedek and then he went off duty at 4.30pm. The inference to be drawn is that he would have attended Wollongong Local Court for a sittings commencing at 10. If he went on duty at 8am at Warilla he clearly went to the police station when he could have started the entry or made the entry. The entry over the preceding pages is that which starts on 28 September 1990. It shows that date as being a Friday and being a day when McDougall was on annual leave but was recalled to duty. As I read the entry it is this: 
     
      
      “On duty 8am Warilla out to Liverpool District Court re Stancou Aga so employed to 1pm meal 1.30pm further duty re same to 4.30pm off duty. 
      
     
     
      
      6pm the New Court Tavern Campbelltown. Speak to Sergeant Fred Holovinsky re Bedek inquiry. Holovinsky requested that I follow him to toilet for discussion. Followed to men’s toilet. Holovinsky informs me that he is involved in a plantation on the South Coast with Bill Treacy and Landini. ‘Nothing wrong with a bit of green. Wouldn’t mind if you kept an ear out - if you hear anything give us a call and it will be worth quid to you.’ ‘You’ll never find a plantation - it’s a sure thing.’ 
      
     
     
      
      Upon returning home contacted Detective Bridge at drug squad and informed. 
      
     
     
      
      29/9/90 contact and inform Detective Sergeant Woods inform of same. Tried to contact Plantation Unit re same. Unsuccessful. 
      
     
     
      
      Contact DEA. Obtain Detective Sergeant Beaumont’s number. Call pager. 4.45pm speak to Beaumont. 
      
     
     
      
      Sunday 30 September 90. Speak to Detective Sergeant Beaumont of Plantation Unit at Lake South.” 
      
    Lake South is the southern entrance to Lake Illawarra at Windang. 136 Exhibit 44 is a report of Detective Sergeant Peter J Woods of the Warilla Police Station. I infer that McDougall was working under Detective Sergeant Woods. Detective Sergeant Woods confirms that on Saturday 29 September 1990 he received a telephone call at his home from Detective Senior Constable McDougall attached to Warilla Police Station. He confirmed that he received a further telephone call from McDougall later on the same day and was told by McDougall that Detective Senior Sergeant Beaumont of the Plantation Unit was coming down to see him on the following day, the Sunday. That Senior Sergeant Beaumont of the Plantation Unit attended upon McDougall on the Sunday morning at Lake South is not disputed.137 Eventually McDougall was directed to prepare a written report of what had occurred with the plaintiff. The report confirms that McDougall approached the plaintiff to talk about Bedek. It confirms that after a short period engaged in that conversation the plaintiff asked McDougall to follow him into the toilet as he had a proposition that he wanted to put to him. The statement continues thus: 
     
      
      “Sergeant Holovinsky went to the male toilet situated between the two bars of the hotel in a hallway. I followed him in a short time later. When I entered the toilet I saw Sergeant Holovinsky check the cubicles by pushing open the doors.  
      
     
     
      
      Sergeant Holovinsky said ‘Are you interested in earning a quid?’ I said ‘Depends on what it is. What do you mean?’ He said ‘You’re on the South Coast aren’t you?’ I said ‘Yes.’ He said ‘I’ve got two mates down there growing a bit of green, there is nothing wrong with a bit of green, it is not that other shit, smack. Anyway, they got a plantation down there and we might want a hand with it.’ I said ‘What sort of hand?’ He said ‘Just keep an ear out, if you hear anything you know anybody asking questions, just give us a call. It’s worth a quid to you.’ I said ‘Where is the plantation?’ He said ‘You’d never find it, it’s well hidden, it’s safe, a sure thing. They’re good blokes too, you know Billy Treacy don’t you?’ I said ‘He’s from Bankstown isn’t he?’ He said ‘You know him, him and Landini?’ He said ‘Bobby, it’s a sure thing, just keep your ears open and let us know, there’s a grand in it for you. It’s only a bit of green otherwise I wouldn’t be involved, not if it was that other shit. You know where I am, just give me a call.’ Sergeant Holovinsky then walked from the toilet. I waited a few moments and then walked from the toilet to an adjoining bar. I got a coaster and pen and wrote down the names Billy Treacy and Landini. I then returned to the bar where I was drinking. I saw that Sergeant Holovinsky was standing at the bar drinking with some civilians. I returned to the bar and bought a drink and took up a conversation with some other people at the hotel. A short time later I left and returned to my home.” 
      
    The statement goes on to record that when he reached his home he contacted Warilla VKG and requested they activate a pager for the Wollongong Drug Squad. 138 A short time later McDougall received a telephone call from Detective Senior Constable Bridge. McDougall stated that he informed Detective Bridge of his conversation with Sergeant Holovinsky and requested that he make a note of it for future reference.139 An interesting thing in this case is that despite the volumes of paper that have been put before me there is no statement from Senior Constable Bridge nor is there any note put before me that he may have made on the evening of 28 September 1990. However, equally there was no challenge to McDougall at any time that he did make that phone call to Warilla VKG. 140 The first enquiry that I must make is when did the meeting occur? The only thing I can conclude on the evidence is it occurred on 28 September 1994. I know why McDougall was at the District Court at Campbelltown. Even if the Police Force cannot keep good records, the courts do at least a better job and the listing of the matter at the Campbelltown District Court on 28 September 1990 could easily be proved or disproved. No attempt was made to disprove it. It is common ground that McDougall went to the hotel after finishing at court. If court rose at four McDougall could have been in the tavern by 4.05. He records the approach to him by Mr Holovinsky in his duty book as being at 6pm. One can infer therefore that McDougall had been in the hotel taking beer for approximately two hours before he had the conversation with the plaintiff. I do not know for how long the plaintiff may have been at the pub on that day. It is accepted by the plaintiff that he was well affected by alcohol and, again, to use a term much used by counsel, “half tanked”. Of course the plaintiff makes the same allegation about McDougall, but that may be self-serving. However, it is clear that after the conversation and probably having a beer with the plaintiff, McDougall had another beer before he drove himself home. One can accept that there was a period of at least two and a half hours of drinking by McDougall which could have affected his memory of things.141 However, the drive from the Court Tavern to McDougall’s home at Warilla required a journey of 120 kilometres which would take at least an hour and a half. I do not know if at that time or even currently that police officers believe themselves to be protected from drink driving random breath tests. I cannot make any finding as to the exact extent of McDougall’s sobriety, however, the plaintiff admits that he was “half tanked”. 142 However, I am only really concentrating at this time as to when the conversation occurred. McDougall goes home, makes a call that evening, the non-existence of which call could be proved, and that has not been done. It is clear the next morning he contacts both his immediate superior, Detective Sergeant Woods, who advises him to phone the Plantation Unit of the DEA, which McDougall does, and McDougall has an interview with Beaumont of the DEA on the following day, the Sunday.143 All those documents speak of the event occurring on 28 September. How, I ask myself, could Mr Holovinsky deny that it occurred then and know it occurred on the twenty-first when he has no records whatever? He would have been first asked to think about when the conversation might have occurred some time after his arrest. No doubt, after his arrest and imprisonment he would have spent a long time thinking about what had happened to him and how things may have come about. Equally, as I have sought to make out, the plaintiff spent a lot of time labouring under the influence of alcohol. The only finding I can make is that the meeting occurred on 28 September 1990. Why would the plaintiff bother to dispute that? Nothing really much turns on it. 144 However, the plaintiff seeks here, and also sought at trial, to establish a time delay to enable firstly a gap in time which would further reduce McDougall’s memory and allow a period of time on which he might have reflected over the information that had been supplied to him. In other words, deliberately disputing the time involved and seeking to give a period of time before McDougall raises his report, gave the plaintiff an opportunity to attack McDougall.145 The essential question for me is which of the two versions of this conversation is the correct one or is there some other plausible explanation of what occurred? The first thing to note is that this conversation followed upon the conversation that there had been had earlier in the month at the Court Tavern between Treacy, the plaintiff and Moore. If one leaves aside at the moment the plaintiff’s recall of that conversation as being self-interested and the recall of that conversation by Treacy as being tainted because of his status as a criminal, one is still left with the version of that conversation given by Mr Moore who is at least one person whose credit has not been impugned in this case.146 I therefore can accept the conversation which I will broadly outline that occurred between the plaintiff, Treacy and Moore in early September 1990. The meeting between the plaintiff and McDougall concerned the same matter. The complexion put on it by McDougall is very different to the complexion of the conversation that had earlier been had by Treacy, Moore and the plaintiff. That, in my view, attenuates the weight to be given to McDougall’s version.147 Common to both the versions of the plaintiff and McDougall are the mention of the name Landini, the mention of the name Treacy, the mention of “a cannabis crop”, the mention of the South Coast and the mention of a benefit to McDougall. According to McDougall the benefit is “a quid”. According to Holovinsky the benefit is a “good pinch”. Holovinsky also says that there was mention of the name Cobargo. That was the position he adopted throughout his evidence both at committal and trial. It was clearly a name that was mentioned by Treacy and heard by Moore. It is to be recalled that the plaintiff was “half tanked” and that McDougall had been drinking beer for about two hours. It is quite plausible that the plaintiff may have said something that McDougall misinterpreted. Equally it is plausible that because of Holovinsky’s alcohol intake he expressed himself in a way that could easily have been misinterpreted by McDougall. 148 I accept that the word “quid” was used by the plaintiff, but the fact that McDougall might make a quid for himself might be explicable by his earning a reward for the arrest. If the word quid was used, and I believe it was used, because that is the important word recorded by McDougall in his duty book, then one linking Landini, Treacy, the cannabis crop and the South Coast and a quid could easily be mixed up by McDougall or have been communicated ineptly by the plaintiff to McDougall who took it to mean something other than what the plaintiff meant.149 I am prepared to accept that the plaintiff did mention the name Cobargo. There was no reason why he should not because it was openly discussed by Treacy in the presence of Moore. It may well be that McDougall forgot about the mention of Cobargo.150 Assuming that the elements of the conversation are Landini, Treacy, cannabis crop, South Coast and a quid, does the version put forward by McDougall add up? Perhaps to jump ahead of myself I should point out this. It will become increasingly clear as I discuss further developments that there was absolutely no relationship between Landini and Treacy. They were not known criminal associates. Treacy disliked Landini. In fact it was mentioned at one stage that Treacy detested Landini. No link whatever has ever been established between Treacy and Landini. In fact it became clear that the plaintiff wanted only essentially one thing to occur to Landini, that he be arrested. Mr McDougall acknowledged this repeatedly when giving evidence. 151 Once one takes out of the elements Landini and Treacy being mates of the plaintiff, it can quickly be seen that the version of events given by McDougall falls apart. It also ought to have become clear to the investigating police that once Landini and Treacy were not mates of each other, and in particular that Landini was not a mate of Mr Holovinsky, that there was a serious and fundamental flaw in the investigation mounted by the police against the plaintiff and a serious error in the information relayed by McDougall to his superiors in the Police Force.152 Furthermore, the version of events given by McDougall is inherently improbable. It is inherently improbable for a number of reasons. Firstly, if a notorious criminal, Landini, and a criminal, Treacy, had a marijuana crop down the South Coast which could return them over eight million dollars, one would expect that they would do their best to preserve its integrity and if it was necessary to have an agent in the Police Force, then to choose somebody who was reliable and dependable, albeit corrupt. Somebody who was almost permanently half tanked would hardly be reliable. If the plaintiff had been involved in this enterprise, if there were such an enterprise, then how could his mates who were involved in the enterprise, accept that Holovinsky could keep his mouth shut in his cups? It is implausible. 153 But the implausibility is added to further by these considerations. There is nothing to suggest that Holovinsky knew that McDougall was corruptible or likely to take a bribe or become part of an illegal scheme. The evidence does not disclose any reason to think that McDougall was corruptible. Here is a patent approach by Holovinsky to McDougall without any attempt to feel McDougall out as to whether he might be susceptible to corruption. There is no “sounding out” of McDougall by the plaintiff. If the plaintiff were involved with a cannabis crop on the South Coast which could return millions of dollars in money, one would think that he would be very circumspect in approaching a policeman to try to inveigle that policeman into the criminal enterprise. Why would he approach somebody without trying to sound out the policeman as to whether he were corruptible? 154 The next implausibility is that if the plaintiff were conspiring with Treacy and/or Landini, that he would mention in the first contact the co-conspirators’ names. 155 Another thing which I must bear in mind is the statement in the first paragraph that I’ve quoted from McDougall’s report about the scene of this conversation on his version of it, a conversation in the men’s lavatory. According to McDougall, Holovinsky checked to ensure that no one else was present by checking the cubicles and by pushing open the doors of each cubicle. It was established at trial, one would think incontrovertibly, that there was only one toilet stall, one cubicle, in the lavatory in question and that that toilet cubicle was fitted with a door which had a spring which kept the door permanently opened outward unless somebody entered the stall and sought to lock the door to ensure privacy.156 It may well be that the conversation occurred in the lavatory, but clearly the detail supplied by McDougall in his statement is quite unreliable. 157 One must note that the plaintiff said that he wrote down the name Henry Charles Landini, Little Danny on a coaster and gave it to McDougall. McDougall said that he got the coaster and he wrote on it the names Billy Treacy and Landini. The coaster was clearly one kept by McDougall. In a formal statement that he prepared for use in court, made after the arrest of the plaintiff, McDougall wrote in his statement “I produce that coaster”. It has never been produced. McDougall said, and I am quite prepared to accept that he gave it either to a superior officer, either to Detective Sergeant Krawczyk or Detective Sergeant Beaumont. 158 Of course the plaintiff interprets the loss of the coaster in a nefarious fashion that if it were produced it would show his handwriting on it and the failure to produce it was because to do so would be to the embarrassment to McDougall. That is a possibility, but it would involve grave moral turpitude. The reality of life is that things can easily be explained by the more probable method of it just having gone astray somewhere when somebody failed to realise that it might become quite significant.159 A further implausibility is when the name of Billy Treacy being mentioned that McDougall insert the matter “He’s from Bankstown isn’t he?” Well Treacy was not a Bankstown boy nor was he a Balmain boy, he was a Merrylands boy, who subsequently moved to the Campbelltown area. The plaintiff would have know him as a Merrylands man or a local man and if Treacy and McDougall asserted that he was from Bankstown one would have thought that the plaintiff would have disabused McDougall of that misinformation. However, that does not occur in McDougall’s version of what occurred.160 Another significant matter from my point of view is that in the statement there is mention of “a grand” meaning, I assume, $1,000. However, the specific offer of $1,000 is not contained in McDougall’s duty book. All that is mentioned there is “a quid”. Why would he write in his duty book “a quid” if the offer was in fact $1,000? 161 Merely on the considerations I have raised thus far the version of the conversation offered by the plaintiff appears to be more probable than that offered by McDougall.162 As I discuss, as I shall tomorrow, subsequent events, it becomes even clearer in my view that the proposition put by McDougall in his report of there being a conspiracy involving Landini, Treacy and the plaintiff is just not supportable.STOOD OVER PART HEARD TO FRIDAY 25 AUGUST 2006FRIDAY 25 AUGUST 2006163 Shortly before I rose yesterday at approximately 5pm, I made a finding that the version of the initial conversation between the plaintiff and McDougall that I held occurred on 28 September 1990 was probably more in line with what the plaintiff said than with what McDougall alleged. In making that finding I also bear in mind what I will say about subsequent developments in the interaction between the plaintiff and McDougall. However, there is one further thing that I should add. It requires me to go back a little to discuss the relationship between the plaintiff and Treacy.164 Mr Treacy made it clear that he approached the plaintiff, knowing him to be a Sergeant of Police and a former Detective because of the antecedent relationship between the two of them. Mr Treacy, as I have said, described himself as a criminal and it became clear from his evidence that he would not have volunteered any information to any member of the police force other than the plaintiff because he had an expectation, that might be the best way of describing it, that the plaintiff would respect the information that Treacy provided to the plaintiff and also respect Treacy’s privacy. Mr Treacy made it clear that he did not want his information to be ascribed to him, Mr Treacy; in other words, that he was to remain completely anonymous.165 In the electronically recorded conversations between the plaintiff and McDougall after 28 September 1990 Treacy’s name is never mentioned, the plaintiff referring to Treacy as either “my informant” or “my gig”. It is otherwise in the conversations recorded in notes made by McDougall after the conversations had occurred and for which there is no corroboration.166 The question, which arises, is why the plaintiff mentioned Treacy to McDougall. It is clear that he did because both of them say so. The reason is likely, in my view, to be disinhibition on the part of the plaintiff because of the amount of alcohol that he had consumed.167 The thrust of the plaintiff’s evidence and his case is this: He obtained what he thought to be important criminal intelligence from Treacy. He thought it could be used to effect an arrest of Landini. He thought that purpose of greater moment that merely discovering the cannabis plantation or plantations. 168 His idea was that if Landini were successfully arrested on this plantation he could receive some kudos which would further his career. For that purpose the plaintiff alleges he passed on this intelligence to McDougall in the expectation that McDougall would use the intelligence to build up a brief which could lead to the arresting of Landini at the plantation site and his successful prosecution. The plaintiff maintained that in that way he would get kudos from the arrest because he was the source of intelligence for McDougall. 169 The submission of the defendant is that that plan or course of action was implausible and incredible. Objectively, there is very much to be said for that. However, if one considers the matter, bearing in mind certain attributes of the plaintiff to which I have referred, it can be seen that the matter may have appeared to be less implausible to the plaintiff. 170 The first attribute, of course, is his geographical ignorance. True, it would seem objectively, to be implausible, to impart information to a Detective Senior Constable at Warilla in order to arrest somebody who lived at Mystery Bay and had a drug plantation in the region of Cobargo. The Warilla patrol extended from the entrance to Lake Illawarra to the commencement of Seven Mile Beach which is at Gerroa. There would then be the Nowra patrol and a number of other patrols before one got to Cobargo which is in the Bega patrol. The major sites after Nowra are, of course, Milton, Ulladulla, then Batemans Bay, Moruya and then Narooma. However, as far as the plaintiff was concerned, all these places were on “the South Coast”. 171 The next thing is that one must look at it as Mr Holovinsky was, essentially through amber coloured spectacles, through the bottom of a schooner glass. The plaintiff may well in his cups have not realised how objectively implausible the position was. Equally, since intoxication inhibits the thinking process, he may not have adverted to the fact that the kudos for the arrest of Landini might be claimed and/or assigned to McDougall rather than to him and may not have realised that to effect the arrest McDougall would have to involve the DEA.172 A major hesitation which I have in accepting the thrust of the plaintiff’s position is why he did not turn and give his information to the DEA. It is clear that it was corruption at the local level that was suspected by Gravener, that is that it was the police in the Cobargo/Bega area who were in with Landini. It is also clear that the raid which was carried out on Gravener’s property in the past was carried out by the State Drug Crime Commission, probably using the manpower of the DEA. 173 However, that does not mean that the DEA itself were involved in the corruption that favoured Landini. It depends on what intelligence may have been passed by the local police to State Drug Crime Commission. They could have omitted any reference to Landini and merely mentioned that they suspected that Gravener had a plantation.174 The plaintiff has maintained that it was because of the involvement of the DEA in the first raid on Gravener’s property that caused him not to approach the DEA himself but to approach McDougall.175 I am very sceptical about that explanation but weighing all things together, as I must, it still seems to me that the plaintiff’s version of what happened at the meeting, the first meeting between him and McDougall is more probable than that alleged by McDougall.176 At this stage one must consider what the plaintiff should have done when he was given criminal intelligence by Treacy. Exhibit 38 is the New South Wales Police Informant/Reward Plan published in September 1997. Exhibit 29 is a New South Wales Police Circular dated 9 October 1987 which in itself is a précis of exhibit 38. 177 The preface to the Informant/Reward Plan is this: 
     
      
      “The management of intelligence is crucial to the policing function. The community generally and ‘police informants’ in particular are a major source of intelligence. 
      
     
     
      
      Paradoxically, police involvement with rewards and informants is a high risk area with the potential of attracting a great deal of criticism to the individual member and to the Force as a whole. Consequently, this function warrants the closest supervision. 
      
     
     
      
      This plan formalises policies and procedures in relation to informants and rewards. It protects individual police against unfair attack and ensures that the Force, as a whole, is in a position to meet any criticism in relation to the disbursement of rewards.” 
      
    That preface sounds some notes of caution. 178 The first two paragraphs of the plan ought also be considered. They are these: 
     
      
      “1. The ethical management of police informants is a matter of paramount importance for the effective and efficient operation of the New South Wales Police Force. Likewise, acknowledgement by this Force, for assistance given, is seen as extremely important in the overall management of this organisation.  
      
     
     
      
      2. By the very nature of their duties it is essential for police, particularly those engaged on criminal investigation duties, to cultivate and maintain contact with informants. Many of these persons are either suspected of being actively engaged in crime or, at least, consorting with known, active criminals. Consequently, police contact with informants is fraught with an element of danger in that it provides the basis for suggesting improper relationships and, or, implication by Police in criminal activities.” 
      
    179 The Plan requires that police informants be registered. A police informant is defined as a person who, for monetary or other gain, supplies information on criminal activities to a member of the police force. The Plan is detailed and I shall not quote it in this judgment. Part of it, headed “Annexure A1”, lays out duties devolving from the Plan and one set of duties falls upon “case officers”, the case officer being the policeman who takes the intelligence from the police informant.180 It is common ground that the plaintiff did not register Treacy as a police informant because Treacy did not want to be registered as a police informant. The plaintiff ignored the Informant/Reward Plan essentially because that is what Treacy wanted him to do. 181 The next thing the plaintiff should have done is to have reduced the intelligence communicated to him to writing in the form of a report so that it could be processed onwards. Had the plaintiff done that and even if the only person to whom he passed on the report was McDougall, there would not have been the opportunity of McDougall’s misinterpreting the information being passed on by the plaintiff. The plaintiff ought, having reduced his intelligence to writing, to have passed it on to his immediate superior or to the head of detectives where he served or directly to a State investigative body such as the State Drug Crime Commission or the DEA or, indeed, to Internal Affairs because part of the intelligence conveyed to the plaintiff was a suggestion of corruption at the local level between police and Landini.182 The plaintiff did none of those things. The plaintiff passed on his information to McDougall, probably in the lavatory of a hotel at Campbelltown, when he was, on his own admission, “half tanked”. The procedures in place were in fact there, to a large extent, for the protection of the policeman himself. By ignoring proper police procedure the plaintiff could be seen, at the very least, as contributing to what befell him. By not placing his intelligence in writing, by not registering his informant and by going sideways, not upwards, in the police organisation the plaintiff could expect to fall under suspicion. That is exactly what occurred.183 The defendant went to great pains, and very successfully in my view, to point out what the correct procedures were and how the plaintiff did not follow those procedures and how, to use a neutral word, how entirely “informal” the procedure was that the plaintiff adopted.184 I return to the events after 29 September 1990. As I have said, there is no dispute that McDougall spoke to Detective Sergeant Woods on 29 September 1990 and to Detective Senior Sergeant Beaumont on 30 September 1990. That was a Sunday. Monday 1 October 1990 would have been the Labour Day holiday.185 On Tuesday 2 October 1990 Detective Sergeant Woods spoke to McDougall about his contact with Detective Senior Sergeant Beaumont. On 3 October 1990 Detective Sergeant Woods informed Chief Inspector Brook, the Patrol Commander at Warilla, of McDougall’s allegations.186 On Friday 5 October 1990 reports were made by Detective Sergeant Woods and by McDougall in writing and they were forwarded on by Chief Inspector Brook to the District Commander for the Wollongong District and to the Regional Commander South which, as I understand it, covered the area from the Illawarra to the New South Wales/Victorian border. This intelligence was also forwarded on by the District Commander at Wollongong to Internal Affairs.187 It is clear that McDougall was extremely reluctant to be involved in the investigation and had to be ordered and then cajoled to do so. At the criminal trial much was made of that and the “spin” put on McDougall’s reluctance was his guilty knowledge of his attempt to incriminate the plaintiff by verballing him. However, the reluctance of McDougall can be seen in more human terms by the reluctance of any member of a disciplined organisation to give information against another member of that organisation, especially when the two are known to each other and have worked together. I understand this to be sometimes known as being reluctant to be a “rat in the ranks”. 188 On 12 October 1990 it was necessary for Detective Senior Sergeant Krawczyk of the Drug Enforcement Agency, who essentially took over the investigation of the allegations of McDougall against the plaintiff, to meet with McDougall to encourage him and persuade him to persist in the investigation by being an agent provocateur. McDougall was to pose as a policeman who had agreed to join in the plaintiff’s alleged corrupt enterprise, to play along in the role as a “corrupt cop”.189 The meeting between Krawczyk and McDougall was held at the Group 7 Leagues Club at Kiama. It would appear that the meeting lasted for eight and a half hours, ending at 12.30am. It did involve dinner but the clear inference is that it also involved the drinking of alcohol. One cannot leave the current case without noting that whether it was the plaintiff or those investigating him, many police conferences were held in licensed premises. This was criticised as far as the plaintiff was concerned by the defendant but the defendant’s own witnesses freely admitted to often meeting in licensed premises where a drink might be consumed from time to time.190 The next contact between the plaintiff and McDougall occurred on 26 October 1990. That was a Friday. It happened at 2.14pm, according to McDougall, when the plaintiff was at the Court Tavern. 191 Paragraph 15 of McDougall’s statement of 4 January 1991 sets out the conversation and paragraph 15 mirrors the notes that McDougall said he made after the contact which are exhibit 46. Paragraph 15 is in these terms: 
     
      
      “On 2.14pm that day 1990 I telephoned the defendant at the new Court Tavern. I spoke to a barman and a short time later the defendant came onto the telephone. He said ‘Hello’. I said ‘Yeah. Fred? Bob McDougall.’ He said ‘Gidday, mate’. I said ‘Remember that fishing trip we spoke about?’ He said ‘Yeah’. I said ‘Well, I might come up and have a talk to you about it. I’m on afternoon shift tonight.’ He said ‘Yeah, good idea. Are they running down there or just hanging about?’ I said ‘Yes, running. Listen, I’ll talk to you when I see you.’ He said ‘Yah, we might catch a couple of them’.” 
      
    McDougall was challenged on the basis that the plaintiff had an interest in fishing and that the conversation was about fishing. It may well have been. Equally, as Mr Gross has submitted in the current matter, the conversation and the reference to fish might be a reference to police and Holovinsky wanted to know whether the fish were active or inactive, that is whether something was being done about investigating Landini.192 On 31 October 1990 there was a telephone conversation between the plaintiff and McDougall which was electronically intercepted. It alludes to the fact that the plaintiff and McDougall had not met on 26 October 1990. Apparently McDougall turned up at the Court Tavern but the plaintiff had left. The plaintiff said in the conversation that he was unable to wait any longer as he had to be home “for the kids”. The conversation records that McDougall had managed to leave aside his work partner somewhere and said that he wished to talk to the plaintiff about fishing. It was McDougall who raised the subject of fishing. 193 Arrangements were made to meet at the Court Tavern after lunch on 1 November 1990. The conversation itself does not suggest anything of a criminal or suspicious nature. It was McDougall pressing to make contact with the plaintiff and arrangements being made for a get together at the usual watering hole. Furthermore, the conversation as recorded at page 1262 of exhibit 5 indicates no sense of urgency or priority or purpose that one might associate with somebody who is keen to protect a cannabis plantation worth $8.5 million.194 Mr Holovinsky did not wait around for McDougall to turn up because he had to go home for domestic reasons. Equally, in setting the time for the next meeting, it could not be set at such a time as would interfere with the plaintiff’s playing of golf. Again, if the plaintiff were involved in some criminal activity involving cannabis plantations with the aim of making money, he had a very strange set of priorities. 195 On 1 November 1990, according to McDougall, he arrived at the Court Tavern at 3pm. At about 3.45pm the plaintiff came into the bar area and there was a conversation between them. Paragraph 21 of McDougall’s statement of 4 January 1991 contains his version of the conversation. It is this: 
     
      
      “The defendant said to these other men ‘Excuse me fellows, we need to talk a bit of business.’ I left the table and with the defendant I walked to the servery area of the bistro. The defendant said ‘How’s it going?’ I said ‘Good’. He said ‘Listen, that stuff I was talking to you about the other day is not on. I’ve heard it’s too hot down there.’ I said ‘How do you mean?’ He said ‘I’ve spoken to my mate Treacy and there is six cars around his house. He reckons he is being followed. He called me about 2pm. It’s too hot.’ I said ‘What do you mean it’s too hot? Who’s too hot?’ He said ‘Your blokes were all right.’ He said ‘It’s not my blokes it’s Danny, Danny Landini. Danny is down at a plantation at Eden. Not Henry but Danny. My blokes are okay. Did you know that I went to school with Bill?’ I then spoke with the defendant in relation to other matters. A short time later we went back to the table and joined the other males.” 
      
    196 There is no dispute that the police had arranged observation of Mr Treacy. Mr Treacy, having some expertise as a criminal, was clearly able to observe the fact that he was being observed. I would have little doubt that Treacy would complain to Holovinsky about being observed if his only recent contact with the police was his imparting of the intelligence concerning Landini and the cannabis plantation down the South Coast in early September 1990. No doubt Mr Treacy would be extremely suspicious of the plaintiff in that the plaintiff may have breached his confidence which, indeed, he had by passing on his name to McDougall.197 The rest of the conversation recorded by McDougall makes little sense. There was no suggestion that there was anything happening at Yowrie or Cobargo or anywhere on the South Coast that made things “too hot”.198 After that conversation which would have only taken a few minutes both the plaintiff and McDougall returned to the drinking school. McDougall alleges that there was a further conversation between the pair at 7.14pm. One must consider how much alcohol may have been consumed between 3.45pm, although it may have been 3.35pm and 7.14pm. 199 In cross-examination at page 2476 of exhibit 11 McDougall admitted that the plaintiff was a heavy drinker; was asked how much the plaintiff may have drunk between 3.35pm and 7.14pm, to which McDougall did not have an answer. It was suggested to McDougall that the plaintiff had about twelve schooners of beer. McDougall was not able to answer that question either in that he said he did not know. This was then said: 
     
      
      “Q. Well twelve schooners would not sound excessive for Fred Holovinsky in your observation of him in a four hour period one afternoon, would it? 
       
      A. I don’t think so, no, but twelve schooners is your opinion.  
      
     
     
      
      SOMOSI: My instructions not my opinion.” 
      
    200 Clearly, the instructions given by the plaintiff to his counsel, Mr Somosi, was that during such a period he would have consumed twelve schooners. Those instructions may have been self-serving, the more alcohol the plaintiff had the less likely he would be able to, firstly, follow the conversation, secondly, answer coherently and, thirdly, remember what was said, thereby seeking to exculpate himself. However, the period from 3.35 to 7.14 is a period of three and a half hours and one could easily accept the plaintiff drinking at least seven schooners during that period which, in itself, is a fair amount of alcohol. 201 According to McDougall, the conversation was this: 
     
      
      “About 7.14pm the same evening the defendant said to me ‘Can I steal five minutes?’ I again went with the defendant to the main servery area of the bistro. He said ‘Are you all right or not, tell me’. I said ‘I’m okay’. He said ‘Listen, we want a hand’. I said ‘Well look, there’s lots of action down there. Give me an indication of where it's at. I can’t come back to you every time someone has a look down there in the south. I’d come unstuck real quick.’ He said ‘Look, I don’t know. It’s down there somewhere. I can’t tell you. Listen there’s a big quid in it for you. At least fifteen thousand. Just for keeping me in touch. My share is fifty thousand dollars. That’s how big it is. Mate they don’t even trust me.’ I said ‘Fred, tell me roughly where it is. I can’t come running to you every time I have a whisper. I have to have a rough idea.’ He said ‘I can’t tell you. Mate this is a big one, on top of a mountain. You never find it. They’d never find it.’ I said, ‘As I said, I can’t come here all the time. I work down there. I can’t keep coming up here. It’s too risky today.’ He said ‘Fuck’em’. 
      
     
     
      
      I asked around. I was told I could trust you’. I said ‘Fred, I’m in. I need the dough. Fifteen thousand would pay off my house tomorrow.’ He said ‘Me too’. At the stage another drinker came and spoke to us, interrupting the conversation. The defendant said ‘Keep in touch’.” 
      
    202 The statement of McDougall indicates that he went to a police vehicle parked outside the hotel, made notes of this conversation, then later drove to the Appin Hotel where he had a meeting with Detective Sergeant Krawczyk and Moore. That Detective Sergeant Moore is not to be confused with Mr Rod Moore.203 The first thing to note about these conversations is that the notes were made, say, at about 7.30pm and include notes of the conversation at 3.35pm. They also are notes of the conversation at 7.14pm. McDougall, on his own admission, had by this time been in the hotel for four and a quarter hours. McDougall’s normal drink was a full strength, although he said on occasions he had to drink light beer because of the need to drive from, for example, the Court Tavern at Campbelltown to his home at Kiama, a distance of 120 kilometres.204 In essence, before the learned magistrate and before the jury, McDougall maintained that the notes that he made of these conversations were verbatim or almost verbatim. The learned magistrate could not accept that assertion, nor can I. Anyone who has sat in court for any length of time and listened to evidence being given, in effect a conversation between counsel and witness, knows that it is often difficult to recall what was said ten minutes ago, let alone what was said hours ago. Indeed, if counsel’s question is objected to and an argument follows, counsel often cannot remember the question he or she asked to which the objection was made.205 The only thing I need say at this stage about the first conversation, that is that at 3.35pm, is that the plantation was not at Eden. According to the plaintiff, all he knew was that he was at Cobargo and he had told that to McDougall at the first meeting. If McDougall had forgotten it, then I can only assume that if he had told the plaintiff that the plaintiff would have reminded him that it was at Cobargo.206 There are a large number of implausibilities in the conversation alleged to have occurred at 7.14pm. 207 The first part of it deals with, essentially, McDougall’s agreeing to be part of the scheme he alleged that the plaintiff was involved in. The problem with that is that had already been discussed and agreed according to McDougall’s earlier evidence and conversations. The next part of it is the sudden escalation of the remuneration offered to McDougall by the plaintiff. According to McDougall, the first amount of money offered to him was $1000. This suddenly escalates into $15,000 without anything having occurred in the interim, other than Treacy’s being observed by the police and Treacy’s being concerned that the plaintiff may have passed on intelligence which had caused the police to be suspicious about Treacy. There was no reason for the plaintiff to increase the remuneration offered to $15,000 if McDougall had earlier agreed to be part of the scheme for $1000. 208 Furthermore, according to McDougall, the plaintiff then volunteers information that the plaintiff was to receive $50,000. Why would he do so? In effect, the plaintiff is alleged to be asking McDougall to do work that the plaintiff himself has been engaged to do but if McDougall does the work satisfactorily he is to receive $15,000 but Holovinsky who was only a conduit on the scenario being painted by McDougall is to receive $50,000. One would think that if that were the case McDougall would be claiming that he also was entitled at least to that amount of $50,000. The conversation is implausible.209 The next thing is that it is alleged by McDougall that the plaintiff said that the plantation was “on top of a mountain”. When the plantations were found, they were found in the valley of the Yowrie River and the valley of Russell’s Creek and in adjoining areas. One does not find rivers and creeks on top of mountains. Even though I have had cause to criticise the plaintiff for his geographical ignorance, I am sure that he would be aware of that simple fact.210 Another thing I must compare my observations with certain evidence given by McDougall about this conversation. In exhibit 11, page 2478, McDougall gave evidence at trial that any conversation that he had with the plaintiff on 1 November was “in a long drinking session”. It was put by Mr Somosi to McDougall that by 7 o’clock the plaintiff was “legless” which received this response: 
     
      
      “I don’t recall him being. I have seen him very drunk in the past, I don’t recall him being very drunk that day.” 
      
    211 It is interesting that McDougall does not observe the state of the plaintiff’s sobriety. The person least able to ascertain another person’s state of sobriety is the person who is himself insober. Drunks do not generally realise that those with whom they are conversing are also drunk. It is only the sober who realises the extent of another’s drunkenness. Again, the inability of McDougall to be able to comment adequately on the plaintiff’s state of sobriety on 1 November 1990 indicates that McDougall himself may not have been very sober.212 McDougall said that he was not aware whether the cannabis crops were on top of the mountain or in valleys. He went on to agree that the plaintiff only ever spoke about a crop, according to McDougall and not to the four crops, or more than one crop, that were actually found. 213 On the following day, 2 November 1990, McDougall went on sick report for “stress”. On the day following, 3 November 1990, occurred the eight and a half hour conversation between McDougall and Detective Sergeant Krawczyk at licensed premises in Kiama between 4pm and 12.30am. Going back in my notes, my note for 12 October 1990 was of a meeting between McDougall and Krawczyk at the Group 7 Club at Kiama between 5 and 8pm. Accordingly, earlier I have made a mistake. The meeting on 12 October 1990 was a three hour meeting. The lengthy meeting that involved a meal and a drinking session occurred on 3 November 1990, two days after the meeting between McDougall and the plaintiff at the Court Tavern at Campbelltown and the day following McDougall’s going on sick report. Again, this was a second meeting between McDougall and Krawczyk in which Krawczyk sought to encourage McDougall to continue in the course of action that had been proposed by the police force in investigating McDougall’s allegations against the plaintiff.214 The next contact, it would appear, between the plaintiff and McDougall was on 22 November 1990, some time prior to 4 o’clock. The text of that conversation can be found in exhibit 11 at page 2506, at around line 54. At that time Mr Somosi was cross-examining McDougall about entries made in running sheets by Detective Sergeant Krawczyk and it contains a report to Detective Sergeant Krawczyk of a conversation alleged by McDougall with the plaintiff. This evidence was given: 
     
      
      “Q. Did you report to Krawczyk that the text of the conversation with Holovinsky was:  
      
     
     
      
      McDougall ‘Fred’ on the telephone. Holovinsky, ‘Bobby’. McDougall, ‘The fish are biting down here, lots of big fish.’ Holovinsky, ‘Where Nowra, Greenwell Point area?’ McDougall, ‘Batemans Bay area.’ Holovinsky, ‘Wrong fish. See you later’. McDougall, ‘Okay’.” 
      
    McDougall was asked whether he reported that conversation with the plaintiff to Krawczyk but McDougall said he did not remember the conversation. 215 The text of that conversation in the running sheet involved is found also at page 1295 of exhibit 6. According to the running sheet, the conversation occurred about 3.55pm. There are implausibilities about the conversation alleged. If I am to take “fish are biting” as meaning that police are making investigations, then Holovinsky is asking whether the police were making their investigations in the Nowra, Greenwell Point area. Why would the plaintiff be concerned about the Nowra, Greenwell Point area? That is nowhere near the area where the drug plantation actually was at Yowrie near Cobargo and Nowra and Greenwell Point have no other mention in the whole saga of the current matter.216 McDougall is then alleged to have told the plaintiff that the fish were biting in Batemans Bay to which the plaintiff replied, “Wrong fish”. If that is to mean that McDougall was saying that the police were making investigations at Batemans Bay, the plaintiff is alleged to have said that they were making their investigations in the wrong place but why would the plaintiff have brought up Nowra and Greenwell Point? It, to me, is implausible. 217 There was, in fact, an intercepted telephone conversation between the plaintiff and Treacy at 4.09pm. The conversation was about making arrangements to meet. The plaintiff suggests a meeting at about 11pm that evening or on the following afternoon at 3.30. Treacy agrees to meet the plaintiff at 11pm but it is common ground that the meeting did not occur at 11pm. Mr Treacy’s position in evidence before me is that he would never meet the plaintiff at such a late hour of the evening and it may be that Treacy merely agreed to do so in order to stop the plaintiff’s importuning him to do so. However, the plaintiff did offer an alternative of 3.30pm on the following day.218 At 7.15pm McDougall went to the Burwood RSL Club. At 7.25 he commenced a conversation there with the plaintiff. The conversation between the plaintiff and McDougall ended at 7.42 when the pair were said to return to talk to other people there. The plaintiff left the club at 8.40 and McDougall left the club at 8.55. Before and after meeting the plaintiff, McDougall met with Detective Sergeant Krawczyk at the Three Swallows Hotel at Bankstown. On McDougall’s return to the Three Swallows Hotel at Bankstown, McDougall made notes of his conversation which were countersigned by Krawczyk although he was not present at the conversation.219 The conversation was a lengthy one. The notes made by McDougall are Exhibit 48. The text of the conversation is set out in paragraphs 27 to 30 of McDougall’s statement. Unfortunately it is necessary to consider the text. It is this:  
     
      
      27. I said, “Fred, I’ve got good news and bad news. What do you want first?” He said “The bad news.” I said “A dry job is kicking off soon covering the entire south coast. We’re going down the coast and back up inland.” He said, “When?”. I said “December. Do you want the good news?” He said “Yeah.” I said “I’m running the job”. He said “You fucking beauty. How do you mean?” I said “Beauy [Detective Senior Sergeant Beaumont] and some other prick with fruit salad on the shoulders sail another commissioned police officer] came down the other day and put it on me to get involved in the job. I’m the south coast liaison officer.” He said “When does it start? How long?” I said “About the start of December. About three weeks. I haven’t been briefed yet.”  
       
      He said “Tell me what happened?” I said “Well, Beauy and this other guy came down and had a yarn with the boss, you know. You know, closed doors. Then Beauy came out and said, ‘You’re in’. All I know is that it kicks off in early December and is going to go three weeks. Lots of [travel allowance] and [overtime].” He said “Where are they going?” I said “Starting at Wollongong and all the way to the border on the coast then back up inland, the whole area.” 
      
     
     
      
      He said “They’ll never find it. It’s been going 10 years you know”. I said “Listen, it’s a matter for yourselves but you got to tell me roughly where it is. I can’t keep running back here all the time. I’ll come unstuck real quick. Just an area”. 
      
     
     
      
      He said “It’s safe, ten years.” I said “Mate the last thing I want is to come across some cunt I don’t want to find. You blokes give me a location, just a roughie.” He said, “Bega.” I said “That’s good. At least I know where.” He said “Well when you get there don’t look so hard. It don’t matter, it’s a good one. You’ll never find it.” I said “As I said, the last thing I want is to walk in and find someone and have it all turn to shit.” He said “No mate, it’s all right.” 
      
     
     
      
      28. I said “Listen, while I’m on the subject, a man’s not a camel. I need some freight up front. Don’t get me wrong. But the last thing I need is for this job to go off and then them cunts tell me to fuck off. I’m out of pocket. I need a couple of grand up front. Insurance.” He said “Mate, none of us has got a penny yet. You got to trust us mate, we’re solid gold. The money’s guaranteed. What’d I say, fifteen? And more, and more. Mate there’s going to be extra. Before Christmas. A nice chrissy present.” 
      
     
     
      
      I said “Before Christmas? That can’t be right. That’s not long enough.” He said “Mate, it’s been down three months”. I said “Before Christmas?” He said “Yeah, you’ll get a real good pressy before Christmas. I’ll lob up with a chaff bag full of cabbage and say Merry Christmas. Fifteen and some. You’ll be surprised some. Fifteen plus.” I said “I still have overheads”. He said “Mate, trust me. You can trust us all. I went to school with my bloke. Thirty years I’ve known the cunt. Fuck me. I need the money right now. Legal fees and all that shit. Trust me.” 
      
     
     
      
      I said “Listen, I’m not worried about your bloke. Every time I hear Landini’s name it’s all shit. I don’t know this cunt and I don’t trust him.” He said “Well he is a shit. Don’t worry about him. He’s shit scared of my bloke. He’s on the way out anyway.” I said “As long as I don’t get left out.” He said “Weight’s right mate. A sure thing. 1500 pound at six grand a pound.” I said “How big is the fucking thing?” He said “Mate, a good one”. I said “So how long do you need?” He said “Four weeks”. I said “Well, we won’t be starting for another week, then it’ll take us one and a half weeks to get to Bega. That’s two and a half weeks.” He said “Go slow, drag the train.” I said “Yeah, real slow.” He said “Four weeks. That’s what I’ve been told, then it’s pay day.” 
      
     
     
      
      I said “Fred, listen. The last thing I need is for this to turn to shit. Four weeks doesn’t sound right.” He said “Mate, weight’s right. It’s a sure thing. It’s a one off. My mate’s going to gaol next year guaranteed. This is for his missus, while he’s away. It’s sweet, no chance. A lot of thought has gone into this. We even have the fucking pilot with us”. 
      
     
     
      
      I said “A helicopter pilot?” He said “Fucking oath. That’s how good it is.” I said “Fuck me, you’re kidding.” He said “No mate. It’s a good one. There’s others too. Another bloke is playing, just like you. It’s a good one.” I said “Fred, it can’t get better. You got the pilot and you got the bloke running the job. You’ve got the lot.” He said “I like to make it neat. It’s a good one. I’m meeting my bloke tomorrow at 3pm. I’ll tell him about this. It’s good. We’ll get it in. Just in time for Christmas.” I said “Is he up here?” He said “Yeah, he’s up here and Landini’s down there.” I said “Can you trust Landini?” He said “Fuck him. He’s out anyway. That’s what I’m saying. There’ll be an extra earner for you and me. He’s out.” 
      
     
     
      
      29. The defendant paused for a short time and then said, “What do you reckon, are you happy?” I said “I am fucking here aren’t I. This is the second time I’ve chased you. I’m all right.” He said “You’re like me. I’m a giver. I’ve given this job so fucking much. All the time I give. They fucking owe me. I look after everybody. You’re a giver, I know.” 
      
     
     
      
      I said “Why me Fred. Why pick me out for this?” He said “You’re good value. I know all about you. You’re down there and you’re a man. She’s sweet Bob.” I said “I hope these other cunts are good value”. He said “Bobby. Trust me. Christmas. That’s all it’ll take, Christmas.” I said “Anyway, look as I said, I need a quid up front. Good will.” He said “How much do you want?” I said “What, up front?” He said “No. All told? How much are you expecting?” I said “I don’t know. We spoke about a figure last time.” He said “What did I say. Ten to fifteen. Fucking easy. And some. Bobby, you’ll get that and a real good surprise. Would you be happy with fifteen?” I said “Fucking oath”. He said “Well you’ll be real happy with what you get, trust me.” I said “Well all right, I’m in. I’m here. Just don’t fuck up.” He said “Don’t worry”.  
      
     
     
      
      30. I said “Well all right. This is the situation. They’re doing a run down there. December 1st I suppose. A week and a half down there and a week and a half back. They’re putting a helicopter through the place plus ground crews. Beauy and some fruit salad and me. That gives you blokes two and a half weeks start. There’s only drama for one and a half weeks. That’s a piece of piss. Can you handle that. I just don’t want to walk into some place and find all of you cunts there. Fuck that, I know nothing about this.” 
      
     
     
      
      He said “That’s all right. It won’t happen.” I said “Well okay. I’m in. I prefer a quid up front, but that’s a matter for you blokes. It won’t kill me if there’s nothing.” He said “Mate. Bobby it won’t kill me if it’s not there.” He said “Mate. Bobby. Christmas and we are all laughing.” I said “Okay, I’m happy with that. We better get back to the others.”” 
      
    220 To have had such a conversation occurring between 7.25pm and 7.42pm, to then stay at the RSL perhaps taking food and liquid refreshment until 8.55, then travelling from Burwood RSL Club to the Three Swallows Hotel at Bankstown and then sitting down in that hotel and writing out the conversation would require a prodigious memory which would be the envy of the world. It is quite implausible firstly for McDougall to have remembered all that conversation as he has set it out.221 At this point it is important to note some of the matters that were elicited from McDougall in cross-examination by Mr Somosi. At page 2519 of Exhibit 11 this evidence was given:  
     
      
      “Q. Yet he is offering you up to this point, increasing amounts of money to protect a crop, in a location he never specifically described.  
      
     
     
      
      Q. Is that correct? Yes. Is that correct?  
       
      A. Yes, that would be right.  
      
    222 That is in fact implausible. At pages 2522 to 2525 McDougall was cross-examined about taking sick leave for stress at this time. He was on stress leave on 2 November, 3 November and visited the psychologist, Mr Glancey, on 15 November and on 20 November and on 22 November the very day that this conversation is alleged to have occurred. At page 2527, at line 20, McDougall agreed that the plaintiff was not ‘hassling’ him at all. Commencing at page 2528 Mr Somosi cross-examined the plaintiff about the reference to the helicopter pilot. This is quite implausible. What is attributed to the plaintiff implies that Holovinsky knew an operation was impending, or was to occur, that a helicopter was to be involved and that there was only one pilot who would be flying the helicopter. At page 2532 of exhibit 11 McDougall conceded that there were a number of helicopter pilots that might be available. One should note in the conversation also a regurgitation of matters that had already been discussed and agreed, for example whether McDougall was to be involved in the scheme, whether he was willing to take part and how much was the consideration for his involvement was. There is an air of unreality in the whole of the conversation recorded by McDougall.223 The plaintiff’s case about the meeting at the Burwood RSL was attacked by the defendant on the basis of, why it was necessary to meet at the Burwood RSL Club? The evidence is not clear to me as to who made the arrangements. However, it is patently clear that both Mr McDougall and the plaintiff were quite interested in having a drink and the suggestion for the meeting at that place could have been made by either of them.224 The plaintiff was on duty at Newtown, his licence had been cancelled. He was driven to Burwood by a probationary constable, who was clearly acting as his chauffeur. The police vehicle was parked in the Burwood Police Station. Both the plaintiff and the probationary constable walked together to the RSL Club. They were met there by McDougall. The plaintiff removed his appointments and changed his shirt at the Burwood Police Station, but I have already discussed that scenario when referring to the plaintiff’s visit to the Five Dock Hotel on 15 January 1990.225 The clear inference to be drawn from paragraph 26 of McDougall’s statement is that this was another venue frequented by policemen. No doubt during the time that those performing afternoon shift were entitled to have their meal break, a policeman might frequent the RSL Club. Bearing in mind that so many meetings between police occurred at licensed premises, this I do not find as surprising as did counsel for the defendant. 226 Furthermore, the fact that the plaintiff took the probationary constable along with him to the Burwood RSL Club it does suggest that as far as the plaintiff was concerned there was going to be no conversation about some illegal activity. If there was an intention to discuss some illegal activity the best thing would have been to direct the probationary constable to stay at the Burwood Police Station.227 The criticism that the defendant made in that regard can equally be rebutted by the fact that when it was necessary for McDougall to confer with Detective Sergeant Krawczyk, before and after this meeting, that meeting was not held at the Bankstown Police Station, but at the Three Swallows Hotel at Bankstown. 228 On 25 November 1990 Henry Charles Landini, also known as Little Danny, was arrested. He was arrested for ‘stick-ups’, that is armed robberies. I am unaware as to whether the armed robberies were on the South Coast, or in Sydney. The evidence concerning that arrest can be found in the evidence of Mr Treacy.229 On 28 November 1990 McDougall travelled to Bega, with Detective Sergeant Beaumont. The vehicle was that of Detective Sergeant Beaumont, probably a police vehicle assigned to him. Detective Sergeant Beaumont picked McDougall up at his home at about 8 o’clock. At 8.21 McDougall alleges that he made a telephone call to the plaintiff. 230 According to McDougall’s evidence the telephone conversation was made when the car was stationary at the Pleasant Point Lookout, just south of Kiama, near the big water towers that are at that place. The telephone call was made on a mobile telephone that was supplied by Detective Sergeant Beaumont to McDougall. This was not the usual mobile telephone used by Detective Sergeant Beaumont, as he had swapped it with the mobile telephone of some other squad. The conversation, according to McDougall was this: 
     
      
      “I said ‘Fred? It’s Bob.’ He said ‘Hello mate.’ I said ‘Fred, I’m on my way down the coast to do this drug job.’ He said ‘Where you going?’ I said ‘I don’t know yet, I haven’t been briefed.’ He said ‘Who’s with you?’ I said ‘Gary Beaumont.’ He said ‘What’s happening down there?’ I said ‘Just a conference at this stage. We’re meeting some intelligence blokes down there.’ He said ‘Did you hear that bloke, Landini, is off down there?’ I said ‘What do you mean?’ He said ‘He got locked up for stick-ups.’ I said ‘Bullshit, for real?’ He said ‘Yeah. Have you heard anything?’ I said ‘No. This is the first. When?’ He said ‘The other day. I don’t know much about it yet.’ I said ‘Mate, I told you he was no good. He’s going to bring it all down around our ears.’ He said ‘Yeah. He’s a cunt. But it’ll be all right. Keep your eyes and ears open. See if you can find anything down there.’ I said ‘Yeah, I don’t know much yet. But after the meeting I’ll be a big smarter.’ He said ‘Call me then, will you?’ I said ‘I’ll try to call you about one, all right?’ He said ‘Yeah, yeah, keep in touch’.” 
      
    He finished the call and then made some notes of the conversation. Those notes are exhibit 49 before me. There is controversy over the notes. The controversy concerns an inconsistency between the evidence of McDougall and Detective Sergeant Beaumont. Detective Sergeant Beaumont said that parts of the notes were made as the car was being driven, that although when McDougall commenced to make the notes the car was stationary, the car moved off at some stage before the notes were completed. McDougall says they were completed whilst the car was stationary.231 When looks at the notes there is no suggestion whatever that they were made or any part of them was made in a moving vehicle. The important thing to note about this conversation is that the plaintiff informs McDougall that Landini has been arrested. McDougall alleges that he was concerned that as Landini had been party to the arrangement he could do the enterprise mischief, that he might give away information about the enterprise, which could lead to its being discovered.232 On the afternoon of the same day there was a telephone call made by the plaintiff to McDougall at the Bega Village Motor Inn. The time of the call was 3.43pm eastern standard time, but summer time would have then been applicable, so the call actually occurred at 4.43pm. The conversation is lengthy and I decline to quote it in full. McDougall advised the plaintiff that he was in Bega and that there was to be a conference down there. He said that amongst those attending the conference were members of the drug squad from Queanbeyan and Intelligence officers from Merimbula. What was on the agenda was to select the order of places that were to be investigated.233 At page 1308 of exhibit 6 the following part of the conversation occurs. I should indicate that V2 indicates the plaintiff and V3 indicates McDougall: 
     
      
      “V2: ‘Mate, you know that Danny Landini was, have you heard about Danny Landini down there, he’s at Mystery Bay apparently, he’s got a farm down there, a crop?’ 
      
     
     
      
      V3: ‘No, I haven’t heard mate, I haven’t heard at all, I’ve had me ears open all day, but I’ve heard nothing about it.’ 
      
     
     
      
      V2: ‘Well what happened last week, he apparently has gone to see somebody at Mystery Bay, or somewhere, wherever he is, at Eden is it, does he live down there somewhere?’ 
      
     
     
      
      V3: ‘I don’t know, Eden’s down here mate, yeah, but I don’t know where Mystery Bay is.’ 
      
     
     
      
      V2: ‘I don’t know, well anyhow he’s gone to see a copper down there, and are to do, gone to do business out at his farm, and the coppers approached another copper and the copper’s gone to I.A., so they’re all down there at the moment.’ 
      
     
     
      
      V3: ‘Down where? Say that again?’ 
      
     
     
      
      V2: ‘Danny Landini, the crook, you know he’s a crook?’ 
      
     
     
      
      V3: ‘I know he’s a crook.’ 
      
     
     
      
      V2: ‘Yeah, apparently he’s been doing stick-ups up here too, him and a fella called Ray Riley, have you heard of him down there?’ 
      
     
     
      
      V3: ‘Nah.’ 
      
     
     
      
      V2: ‘Well he’s another crook too, they’re both running together, they’re coming up to Sydney apparently doing stick-ups, this is the information that I got yesterday. And apparently are what, what Dan Landini has done, he’s gone to see a copper down there, right? I don’t know who it is, but are to get, get him to look after some crop he has got growing down there. And this policeman’s gone to see somebody else and the bloke’s gone to see I.A., they’re all down there.’ 
      
     
     
      
      V3: ‘Oh fuck, I told you he’s fucking bad news.’ 
      
     
     
      
      V2: ‘Landini?’ 
      
     
     
      
      V3: ‘Yeah.’ 
      
     
     
      
      V2: ‘Oh he’s no good at all.’ 
      
     
     
      
      V3: ‘Fuck me dead.’ 
      
     
     
      
      V2: ‘Yeah, yeah mate’.” 
      
    234 The same sort of matter is again conveyed to McDougall by the plaintiff on page 1310. It became clear that he there refers to an informant, but that was not his usual informant, Treacy, but in fact Mr Rod Moore. The plaintiff also passes on information that Landini may be a heroin importer and have fishing boats down at Eden, or one of his associates may have. 235 At page 1311 the following occurs: 
     
      
      “V3: ‘Mate, well where does that, where does that put us with this fucking Landini cunt?’ 
      
     
     
      
      V2: ‘Well we want him to go off.’ 
      
     
     
      
      V3: ‘Fuckin’ oath, just get him out of the fuckin’ way for Christ’s sake’.” 
      
    The reference by the plaintiff to wanting Landini to ‘go off’ is a reference to his being arrested.236 What comes through from reading that telephone intercepted call is that the plaintiff was supplying information to McDougall about Landini and it is clear that Landini was badly regarded, to put it mildly, by the plaintiff and that that the plaintiff was happy for Landini to be arrested. 237 During cross-examination by Mr Somosi about this telephone conversation McDougall gave the following answers: 
     
      
      “Q. ‘I suggest to you that what was occurring here was a theme which interested Holovinsky, as far as you were concerned in September, continued through October and November and it relates to getting and trapping Landini, and you and he getting credit for it, correct?’  
       
      A. ‘It went that way eventually, yes. 
      
    238 Part of the telephone intercept was then played to McDougall and he agreed that when the plaintiff used the words “We want him to go off” was that he wanted Landini to be arrested.239 At page 2565 of exhibit 11 this evidence was given: 
     
      
      “Q. ‘And you said “just get him out of the way for Christ’s sake” was the suggestion by you to get Landini off the scene?’  
       
      A. ‘Yes.’  
      
     
     
      
      Q. ‘Get him locked up?’  
       
      A. ‘Yes’.  
      
     
     
      
      Q. ‘Get him put away?’  
       
      A. ‘Yes’.” 
      
    240 In effect there is a discrepancy between the morning conversation of 28 November and the afternoon conversation of 28 November. The afternoon conversation cannot be doubted and is not doubted. The afternoon conversation is consistent with the plaintiff’s case mounted before me, and indeed at the criminal trial, and is inconsistent with the inferences to be drawn, or that McDougall would seek one to draw, from the conversation of the morning of 28 November for the exactitude of which one is totally reliant upon McDougall.241 In the conversation McDougall went on to tell the plaintiff about the areas that were to be covered by this drug sweep along the coast of New South Wales. This was misinformation being conveyed by McDougall in his role as a corrupt cop. However, the misinformation contained information which suggested that the area where the drug crop was would be searched, that is covered the area of Cobargo, Yowrie and the Wadbilliga National Park immediately west of Yowrie.242 In cross-examination McDougall admitted that Mr Holovinsky expressed no concern when McDougall disclosed the area which included, the area where the drug crop was. The important thing about that is that as far as these telephone intercepts are concerned the tapes are no longer available to hear. They were clearly played at the committal proceedings and clearly played at the trial and clearly re-played over and over at the trial.243 Ms Stenmark, for the defendant, had some of the tapes, but they were no longer intelligible and that is completely understandable because they were, as far as the hearing before me is concerned, recorded 16 and 17 years previously on what would now be outmoded technology and had been repeatedly played since that time. One could understand that the tapes are no longer able to be heard, that therefore comments made by those who actually heard the tapes are of utility in helping one to determine the current matter.244 Clearly one’s voice, or response, can carry a tone or inflection, or volume, which might indicate panic, or alarm, joy, or happiness. It is clear that there was no concern expressed by the plaintiff when information was given which would indicate that the area where the drug plantation actually was to be searched.245 At the end of the conversation the plaintiff volunteered to ring McDougall at the Bega Police Station on the following day. It still appears to be odd that an alleged criminal conspirator would want to speak to another alleged criminal conspirator at a police station where the calls might be monitored, or where the identities of the caller and the person called might be known to other police. 246 There were on the following day, 29 November 1990 two further phone calls between the plaintiff and McDougall. Neither of these phone calls was recorded. The notes of McDougall for these conversations are exhibit 51 before me. The first call is alleged to have occurred at 9.16am, when McDougall called the plaintiff at the Newtown Police Station from the Bega Valley Motor Inn. 247 In the first part of the alleged conversation McDougall relates areas where the search was to be conducted, that mimics to an extent what was actually said in the conversation on the previous afternoon. McDougall then records some information about Landini and others, that McDougall obtained from the local detectives. Part of the conversation, according to McDougall, was this: 
     
      
      “’I said I’ll be here. Before you go, can you speak to your mate about Landini? I still don’t trust him.’ He said ‘Don’t worry, he’s off.’ I said ‘The money?’ He said ‘I’m talking to my mate this afternoon about that?’ I said ‘The crop, I got to know where not to look, don’t I?’ He said ‘I don’t know where it is myself. I’ll speak to him’.” 
      
    248 The interesting thing about that alleged interchange is that it became clear from earlier recorded interchanges, if they be accurate, that at least by 22 November, in the conversation at the Burwood RSL Club, that Landini was out of the syndicate of cannabis growers, that he had been excluded and that attempts were being made to ensure, according to McDougall, that he would not pass on intelligence about the cannabis crop to the authorities. McDougall’s saying what he said ignores what had earlier passed between him and Holovinsky on this issue, according to McDougall. In other words there is an internal inconsistency in McDougall’s recounting of these conversations.249 McDougall’s evidence is that at about 3.45pm he returned to the motel from, the police station, and received a handwritten message from the manager of the Bega Valley Motor Inn to ring Fred on a given telephone number. That is obviously to ring the plaintiff. McDougall says he phoned the plaintiff at the given number, which was that of the Court Tavern. Again, there was alleged to be a lengthy conversation between McDougall and the plaintiff, which was subsequently recorded by McDougall in his notes.250 According to McDougall the first thing discussed was McDougall’s getting his money and again the plaintiff was alleged to have told him that he would have to wait. McDougall then says he set out and he described more things about the alleged drug sweep, that is, related more misinformation, then gave some misinformation about when it was to happen. And in the middle of that the plaintiff is alleged to have said, ‘Listen, give us a yell if you go anywhere near Cobargo. Right.’ To which McDougall gave a positive response.251 McDougall then said that the plaintiff asked whether that name had been mentioned at the police meeting on that day. McDougall maintained that the name was only mentioned in passing. 252 The subject of Landini was then raised. The plaintiff had told McDougall that his informant had told him that Landini had a couple of crops at Mystery Bay. One will recall that that had earlier been mentioned. The plaintiff was trying to obtain information as to the exact whereabouts of those two crops belonging to Landini and then expressed the desire that Landini be arrested with those crops. The conversation is alleged to have gone on further with the plaintiff’s saying: 
     
      
      “If you can knock Landini, it will be a beauty.” 
      
    Parts of that conversation are consistent with what the plaintiff says that he was always intending, to have Landini arrested. According to McDougall, this is the first time that the plaintiff mentioned Cobargo. I have already accepted that it was more probable than not that that was raised by the plaintiff in his initial meeting with McDougall on 28 September.253 There is much force in the submissions put both by Mr Gross to me and it could be gleaned that may have been put by Mr Somosi from the way he cross-examined Mr McDougall at the trial that the name Cobargo was dropped into the conversation by McDougall to lend it an air of verisimilitude. 254 On 30 November 1990, McDougall returned from Bega on a Pioneer bus. At 11.30pm on the evening of that day, he made a phone call to the plaintiff at the Newtown Police Station. The phone call was made from McDougall’s home and an attempt was made to record the conversation. Unfortunately, there was a mal-recording of the conversation and only one side of it was recorded. That side was McDougall’s. This was described at the trial as the one-sided conversation. 255 The cross-examination of McDougall concerning this one-sided conversation can be found in exhibit 12 between pages 2628 and 2636. At 2632, McDougall agreed that he was talking about information he had obtained from the plaintiff in the recorded telephone conversation of 28 November 1990 in this one-sided conversation. He was really bringing up again the information previously conveyed by the plaintiff to McDougall about Landini. 256 On page 2633, McDougall admitted that he was talking about Landini when he referred to a person being hated down the South Coast and of a person having a machine gun down the South Coast. At the foot of page 2634, carrying on to 2635, McDougall agreed that the plaintiff was suggesting that police should follow Landini in light of his having a machine gun. At page 2635, the following evidence was given: 
     
      
       “Q. Well up to this point of the conversation, the entire conversation, in effect, from the last third of the first page to this point is very focused clearly on Landini?” 
       
      A. Yes, but that is not the entire conversation. I agree with what you said then, but it was not what you said to me.” 
      
    When one reads the one-sided conversation and the cross-examination that Mr Somosi conducted on Mr McDougall about it, the conversation does not have, in my view, any sinister aspect. That is, any aspect which is inconsistent with the thrust of the plaintiff’s evidence before me.257 Before turning to the events of December 1990 I shall take the luncheon adjournment.258 As I was rising to take a short adjournment, Ms Stenmark of counsel was kind enough to draw my attention to a factual error I have made.259 In reference to the conversation at the Burwood RSL club on 22 November 1990 I made reference to the plaintiff’s taking with him to that meeting a probationary constable who was acting as his chauffeur. The plaintiff had need of the chauffeur because of having lost his driver’s licence. The plaintiff’s evidence, at page 143 of the transcript of 9 December 2004, is that the plaintiff had with him a young probationary constable whose wife was sick and who lived at Burwood. The probationary constable wanted to see his wife and, after driving to Burwood police station, the probationary constable went to see his wife and the plaintiff went to the RSL.260 However, it is clear from page 1296 of exhibit 6 that during the conversation between the plaintiff and McDougall on 22 November 1990 a Detective Sergeant Long from the Five Dock police station and a young probationary constable were present, albeit that neither of those men were present at the time of this private conversation between the plaintiff and McDougall.261 Mr Gross advises that his understanding of the evidence was that the probationary constable returned to the RSL after visiting his wife and was present there for some time prior to leaving with the plaintiff. Commonsense indicates that that was probably the case because the plaintiff could not return to Newtown police station without his chauffeur, the probationary constable, and the probationary constable would need to meet up with the plaintiff after visiting his wife so that the plaintiff would know that his chauffeur was available to take him back to Newtown police station.262 I did not mean to suggest that either the probationary constable or any other person listened to this conversation, merely that they were present in the club at the time that the plaintiff and McDougall were meeting. It still remains that the plaintiff and McDougall met at a place where there might be, and in fact were, other policemen and Detective Sergeant Long, in this case from Five Dock, and that clearly the probationary constable returned to the RSL club so that the meeting, the fact that the plaintiff and McDougall met at the RSL club, could not be disputed.263 Prior to taking the adjournment I indicated that I was about to turn to events of December 1990, but I should indicate, before I do so, that the evidence discloses that on Thursday 29 November, at 3.03pm, the plaintiff entered the bistro area of the Court Tavern and then, at 3.30pm, walked from the bistro area to the public bar, where he approached a number of people seating and standing near the bar. One of those persons was Treacy. The plaintiff had a brief conversation with Treacy there and left the public bar area via the rear entrance. He returned to the public bar at 3.43pm. There were two police carrying out surveillance at the time. That establishes a meeting on 29 November 1990 between the plaintiff and Treacy when it is to be recalled that McDougall phoned the plaintiff at 4.45pm on that same day from Bega in answer to a request to phone the plaintiff at the Court Tavern left at the Bega Motor Inn by the plaintiff.264 What may have been the reason for that meeting? It is clear that from the time of the arrest of Landini for armed robberies on 25 November there was some breaking news. Clearly Gravener and perhaps his associates on the South Coast would want to know what was happening about Landini and perhaps want to know about his bail status. It may be that Gravener spoke to Treacy who then needed to seek further information from the plaintiff, who was obtaining his information in that regard not from Treacy but from Rod Moore. And one can understand conversations of discussions at this time as to what was happening about Landini.265 On 5 December 1990 there were a number of intercepted telephone conversations. The first was at 7pm from Treacy to the plaintiff where Treacy was advised the plaintiff was in the bath. At 7.13pm the plaintiff rang Treacy and was advised that Treacy had gone out. At 7.14 Treacy phoned the plaintiff back and Treacy told the plaintiff that he wanted to have “a yarn”. They arranged to meet at either 12 noon or lunch time on the following day. At 10.37pm McDougall phoned the plaintiff to confirm a meeting for the following day. The plaintiff told McDougall he was playing golf in the morning and that he was meeting a fellow for lunch at 12 o’clock and that McDougall did not want to be there. That clearly is a reference to the meeting that had been arranged between Treacy and the plaintiff. McDougall and the plaintiff arranged to meet between 3.00 and 3.30 on the following day.266 What engendered these telephone discussions was an event that was described both at the trial and in this hearing as the Yowrie bail-up. The best description of the bail-up is at page 70 of the transcript of 1 August 2006. Gravener came across people on his property with knapsacks, surveillance gear and other gear which include camping gear and camouflage gear. Gravener bailed up these people with his rifle. There were twelve of them. Eventually one of them produced his police identity card. The twelve were taken by Gravener, or went with Gravener to the local police station. That was the first description given by Mr Treacy, who then gave this evidence: 
     
      
       
        
       
      
     
     
      
      “Q. What did he do then? 
       
      A. He bailed one person up he found on his property with surveillance things. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. But then he found the others were there? 
       
      A. He asked him what he was doing. He said he was with the army. He walked him back to his car, and then the man pulled his identification out and said ‘I’m with the police’. Mark then put his stuff in the back of the thing and said ‘Ring the police and tell them to come down here’. He got on his two-way and then the rest of them came down to the car.” 
      
    267 Clearly there were police in the vicinity of Gravener’s holding at Yowrie conducting surveillance. Whether they were looking for Landini or for Gravener, I do not know. Clearly Gravener thought that they were observing him. From the presence of surveillance gear, it is clear that they were not there merely to search for a drug plantation. One would think that that intelligence was communicated by Gravener to Treacy and Treacy then arranged to meet with Holovinsky to discuss this development. For some reason or other there had been arrangements made between McDougall and the plaintiff to meet on 6 December and it was now scheduled to meet at about 3:00pm or 3.30pm, after the plaintiff had met with Treacy.268 Page 1390 of exhibit 6 is a police running sheet which confirms that an observation post had been set up on Mark Gravener’s property and that a search of the relevant area on 5 December 1990 failed to locate any plantation. Police surveillance confirms that the plaintiff and Treacy met at the Court Tavern at 2.08pm and conversed from that time until 2.25pm, when they shook hands and Treacy left the bistro of the Tavern and went to the public car park. McDougall entered the Tavern at 3.25pm wearing a listening device. The transcript of the recording made by that listening device between 3.22 and 3.50 is in exhibit 6 pages 1393 to 1408.269 The first part of that transcript records the conversation of no moment other than general interest between the plaintiff, McDougall and one gentleman known as Pidge and another gentleman known as Meatloaf. The relevant conversation commences at page 1400. The relevant part of the conversation occurs after background noises are recorded. ‘V1’ is McDougall and ‘V2’ is the plaintiff: 
     
      
      “V1: What? 
      
     
     
      
      V2: Listen, don’t take any offence (indecipherable).  
      
     
     
      
      V1: Why is that? 
      
     
     
      
      V2: I’m fucking paranoid. 
      
     
     
      
      V1: Fucking so am I. 
      
     
     
      
      V2: Mate, you know what’s happened, don’t you?” 
      
    The conversation continues with the plaintiff’s conveying to McDougall information about the Yowrie bail-up. The original tape is, like every other tape, not available to listen to. It is clear from the transcript of the trial, exhibit 12 page 2098 before me, that after the words “I’m fucking paranoid” the plaintiff said “You are not taped up, are you?”270 This was the first and only occasion on which McDougall wore a listening device. He had been directed by Assistant Commissioner Cole to wear a listening device but refused or declined to do so and was finally coerced on this occasion to wear the listening device. He said he did not like wearing one. The plaintiff’s case at trial was that McDougall did not wish to wear a listening device because the listening device would not record the sort of conversations that McDougall had been reporting the plaintiff as having held. 271 McDougall alleged that during the words “listen, don’t take any offence”, the plaintiff was searching McDougall for a listening device. In his evidence-in-chief, in exhibit 12 page 2362, McDougall said this: 
     
      
      “At the beginning of this conversation the accused was sitting opposite me. He searched my upper body. He reached out with his left hand and patted me under my right arm. He then ran his hand over my chest in the vicinity of my right shirt pocket, took hold of the piece of electronic wire taped to my chest and the fold in my shirt, he felt the wire and ran his fingers up the wire towards the top of the pocket. He then let the wire go and continued with the conversation. The whole of this conversation was recorded on the listening device.” 
      
    McDougall went on in-chief to say he was extremely concerned for his own safety at that time.272 If that had occurred, one would have thought that the plaintiff knew that McDougall was wired up and that he would have desisted from any incriminating conversation thereafter and would have told McDougall to go home using very colourful language. 273 McDougall was extensively cross-examined about there being no noises recorded on the tape to suggest that the listening device was being tampered with and such noises do appear in other places on the tape, especially at the commencement of it when McDougall was adjusting the wire underneath his clothing, when he was entering the hotel and at the end when he was taking the device from his body before actually switching it off. Furthermore, why would the plaintiff ask McDougall “You are not taped up, are you?” if he knew that the plaintiff was taped up?274 The implausibility here is the allegation by McDougall that the plaintiff searched him and actually felt the tapes of the wire body tap. That is highly improbable. Furthermore, the tape itself does not disclose the appropriate noises. I accept that Mr Holovinsky did ask, as Mr Holovinsky admitted at the trial, “whether McDougall was taped up or not”, but I do not accept the assertion of McDougall that he was actually searched and the body wire was found.275 In the transcript of the trial there is also extensive cross-examination as to where the pair were seated and whether it was possible for Mr Holovinsky to have reached over and searched McDougall, bearing in mind the intervening table and their respective sizes. The evidence of McDougall about the search and discovery of the wire is completely implausible.276 Equally, there are areas of evidence before me from the plaintiff which are equally implausible. He sought to maintain that what he meant by the words “I’m fucking paranoid” is that he was suffering from disappointment. His evidence was given commencing at page 194 of the transcript of 13 December 2004: 
     
      
      “Q. Why did you say to him ‘I’m fucking paranoid’? 
       
      A. You will have to look at it in the whole context ma’am. That’s a stage in the afternoon. I am drunk and having a talk with him. I have received certain information and he’s doing nothing. He’s telling me nothing. Nothing’s happening. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. You and McDougall lowered your voices at the time you had this part of the conversation, didn’t you? 
       
      A. No. 
      
     
     
      
       
        
       
      
     
     
      
      Q. Do you say now on your oath that you didn’t? 
       
       
      GROSS: Didn’t what? 
      
     
     
      
      STENMARK: Q. Lower your voices at the time you had that conversation? 
       
      A. To the best of my recollection that’s correct.” 
      
    The plaintiff was then taken to his evidence at committal and admitted to saying yes at that time. In other words, the plaintiff started out giving evidence to me which was inconsistent with his evidence at trial.277 The questioning then continued. At 196: 
     
      
      “Q. Mr Holovinsky, with the doubts in relation to McDougall, I take it came the worry about what he was doing? 
       
      A. I don’t know what I was worried about but what he, about what he was doing. It was probably what he wasn’t doing. 
       
       
      Q. Anxious at what he wasn’t doing? 
       
      A. What are we talking now, about this particular moment here, yes.  
      
     
     
      
      Q. By 6 December you tell the magistrate that you have complete doubts about him? 
       
      A. Yes. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. And with those doubts, I’m putting to you came worry and pressure to you? 
       
      A. Not worry and pressure, just.  
      
     
     
      
      Q. Anxious? 
       
      A. Disappointment. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. Disappointment? 
       
      A. Yes. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. What did you do about your disappointment? 
       
      A. I was just waiting.  
      
     
     
      
      Q. Did you start to panic about the fact that he may have been setting you up? 
       
      A. No, he had nothing to set me up for. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. See, I’m putting to you directly that you started to worry that he was setting you up and that’s why you told him you were fucking paranoid? 
       
      A. No. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. That’s why you frisked him? 
       
      A. I didn’t frisk him. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. If you were having doubts about him why didn’t you go and report the matter to someone else? 
       
      A. Once you pass on information that’s how it goes. That’s how it stays. You wait for a result. That’s the usual way things are done.” 
      
    278 I find that evidence unsatisfactory in the extreme. When one looks at the rest of the taped conversation, it is clear that it was after the Yowrie bail-up. It is clear that after the plaintiff had a meeting with Treacy, Treacy had already had a meeting with the plaintiff at which Treacy may well have voiced his concerns to the plaintiff about surveillance on Treacy after Treacy had spoken to Holovinsky. The aid of Treacy had been invoked by Gravener to try to keep Landini from his property and so that police would not “raid” his property. Police were now near Gravener’s property. In other words, what Gravener did not want to happen had happened and he no doubt voiced his concern about that to Treacy, who no doubt voiced his concern about that to the plaintiff. The plaintiff may have been thoroughly concerned that these two events were linked to his disclosing his information to McDougall. That appears to be the most likely scenario. 279 I return to the telephone intercept.280 One of the interchanges that might be thought to be damning was this: 
     
      
      “V2: Where’s the area I said not to go near. Remember I said, fucking I mention an area. 
       
       
      V1: You said Cobargo. 
       
       
      V2: There they are.” 
      
    281 The plaintiff explains this by saying that the idea was to get Landini at the site of the plantation, or crop, but here are the police there when Landini was not. That was what he was driving at. The telephone conversation goes on to record that “everybody in the fucking town knows they’re there”, meaning everybody in Cobargo and the area knew.282 During the conversation McDougall was at pains to tell the plaintiff that the police at the scene were nothing to do with his operation, the fictitious operation which he had been feeding to the plaintiff. This occurs on page 1403: 
     
      
      “V2: Well nobody knows about it, see that’s what’s fucking been so fucking wrong, that nobody’s ever gone down there ‘til fucking I spoke to you. 
      
     
     
      
      V1: Mate, I’m telling you they’re not our fucking blokes, take it for what it’s worth, they’re not our fucking blokes. 
       
        
       
      
     
     
      
      V2: Well nobody else (indecipherable). 
       
       
      V1: I’m not a fucking magician pal. 
       
       
      V2: I’m not saying (indecipherable) suggesting that to you, right. I’m just fucking suggesting to you that this bloke said to me (indecipherable) Fred, they won’t get a fucking pinch, it’s as simple as that. Fucking all that is going to fucking happen is fucking if whatever happens happens they won’t get a pinch, so it’s not going to do anybody any good. Do you understand what I mean? 
      
     
     
      
      V1: Mate, I’m (indecipherable) fucked, [blasphemy deleted].  
      
     
     
      
      V2: Yeah, I got no idea what’s happening. Mate I just relay what I’m fucking told.” 
      
    That interchange can be read in a number of ways. The reference to there being no pinch down there might mean that there be no arrest of Landini. It could also mean that there might be no arrest of somebody else down there because the person is absent from the crop. One party before me says to take it in the first way and the other party says to take it in another way. 283 The conversation then turns to McDougall suggesting he would speak to someone known as Sam Leckey who could find out what is going on. The plaintiff declined that and continued: 
     
      
      “I just fucking, I don’t know whether fucking (indecipherable) everything was good Bob you know but apparently, apparently for five fucking years it was good and this bloke tried to fucking just do everything right to make sure everything was sweet and all of a sudden fucking just things have turned shit. 
      
     
     
      
      V1: Mate if they have turned shit it’s not from our fucking end. 
       
       
      V2: You look, I mean you look at it this way, like look at it this man’s point of view, he’s not spoken to anybody fucking at any other time, all of a sudden they’re trying to do the fucking right thing and it’s fucking turned to shit, how do you get around that.” 
      
    Again there are various interpretations open to that exchange. It might mean that Gravener had had no police attention for five years and then sought to do the right thing by giving information that could lead to Landini’s being apprehended, and then things went sour when Gravener became the source of police attention again. It may also, of course, indicate that the cannabis plantation was not under surveillance and then information was given to McDougall by the plaintiff and then things have come undone because the police have now turned up, searching for crops and carrying out observations. However, that construction of that interchange gives little value to the words “just doing everything right”, or it could have some sinister criminal content.284 Further in the conversation there is a reference to Landini, who might be giving information, or whether it was Treacy who might be giving information. Then McDougall raises the question of whether a helicopter pilot was talking to somebody. The plaintiff then says: 
     
      
      “No, nothing’s happened, nobody knows nothing. Look I don’t have no idea whether it is right. No idea about nothing. I’m just fucking saying to you, I look at all these bloody things and I just, you know, can’t, just can’t see fucking why tell me anything. I’ve got no idea I just fucking Landini, Landini fucking is a target down there but obviously he’s fucking not.” 
      
    That clearly is a statement by the plaintiff consistent with the plaintiff’s case at trial and before me and which is not open to any other construction.285 McDougall then offered to go and make a phone call to find out what was happening from the police point of view. The plaintiff then said this: 
     
      
      “Hang on, hang on, listen to me, no shit hit the fan, all I’m saying to you is that there are at now, there is only place they are looking at, the bloke that fucking rang and told him he’s been in it for fucking years, he knows it like the back of his hand, he went down there while the cunts were away to check and checked out their fucking knapsacks and there’s no cunt there, he’s seen all the fucking surveillance gear, all the fucking camouflage fucking gear, the whole fucking lot. You know they won’t get a pinch, it’s as simple as that, there’ll be no pinch there.” 
      
    That might mean, of course, that there will be no arrest of Landini because the police presence is so obvious and patent, or it could mean that because Gravener, who is the person who has obviously found the equipment, knows the police are there that no-one will be arrested in connection with this crop.286 The next few interchanges are not particularly relevant, but interchanges occurring on page 140 of exhibit 6 are relevant. They are these: 
     
      
      “V2: Well there’s no fuck up you see as I said to you there’s no fuck up. Nobody is going to get pinched out of it. The only thing we’re concerned about is that (indecipherable) ‘cause he’s fucking saying to these blokes down there, mate everything’s sweet, this is what’s happening, remember the last conversation we had about where you’re going to go and that sort of stuff. 
      
     
     
      
      V1: Mmm. 
       
       
      V2: Now everybody was extremely fucking happy",2006-07-31 00:00:00,NSW District Court

   1. This morning I heard an urgent application by was of Notice of Motion in which the Australian Broadcasting Corporation for the Court’s consent under s 11(4)(b) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (“the Act’) for the publication of the name of a child who was the offender in criminal proceedings in this court. I made orders after hearing the application but because I had a part heard matter commencing at 10 am the applicant agreed that I should set out my reasons in a judgment which will be emailed to the applicant’s office later today.2. The Director of Public Prosecution was not served with notice of the application. No other person was served. I am satisfied that service is not necessary for the following reasons. Firstly, the criminal proceedings cannot be identified by number or subject matter because, I have been advised from the bar table, the Dubbo Court Registry has refused to provide the file number as this would be a potential contravention of the Act, so the Director of Public Prosecutions would have very little to go one. Secondly, the child (“Craig”) has consented. Thirdly, I am satisfied that s 11 of the Act does not in fact apply to the publication because the text of the publication is couched such broad terms as to fall outside the purpose of s11.3. I should first set out a brief description of the publication and the reasons for urgency. The applicant is participating in “The Message Stick” Film Festival and the films, “When the Natives Get Restless”, a documentary about the lifestyle of teenage Aboriginals in isolated country towns, is to be shown this Sunday. The purpose of the documentary is to identify and analyse the significant social problems these young people face. From the little of the documentary that I have seen, it is a compassionate and insightful documentary of the same kind as that considered by Hulme J in Regina v Jay Hart (Supreme Court of New South Wales, 7 July 2006, unreported).4. The part of the documentary which is the subject of this application shows adolescent boys and girls talking frankly about their experiences with the law. During this exchange, one of the children appears to make an admission about having been in a juvenile centre. The text of the documentary in which the child (whom I shall call “Craig” and who is now 14 years old) is shown apparently acknowledging he has spent time in a juvenile centre is as follows: 
     
      
      Craig: “I’ll never go to jail… me (bread) bad?” 
       
      Girl: “How would you know?” 
       
      Craig: “Coz I know”  
       
      Girl: “No you don’t”  
       
      Girl: “Coz… they’re bad… they don’t know how to stay out of trouble” 
       
      Boy: “They will be down, that’s what they will be” 
       
      Craig: “Not me boy…” 
       
      Boy: “Can’t you be out of juvenile centre you cunt?” 
       
      Craig: “You don’t care, that doesn’t mean I’ll go back to jail my (bread) bad?” 
      
    5. The applicant has made inquiries and ascertained that at an unknown date the child shown apparently admitting that he had in fact spent time in a juvenile detention centre had indeed done so, as a result of a sentence imposed in the District Court at Dubbo. The crime or crimes for which he was convicted are unknown to the applicant because the court staff at Dubbo were not prepared to reveal the charges, or even to give the applicant the file number for the District Court criminal proceedings in which the child was convicted. I do not know if any orders were made during those proceedings for the use of pseudonyms.6. The child has consented to being named and copies of his consent, witnessed by his mother, have been tendered.7. The applicant has responsibilities as a model litigant. It brings a Notice of Motion seeking the following orders: 
     
      
      (a) The Court consents to the publication and broadcasting of the name of the child in connection with these proceedings in the program “When the Natives Get Restless” (“Program”), such consent to extend to any republication or rebroadcast of the Program or any part of it. 
       
       
      (b) Such further or other orders as this Honourable Court thinks fit. 
       
      
    8. Section 11 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act provides: 
     
      
      “(1) The name of any of the following persons must not be published or broadcasted in a way that connects the person with the criminal proceedings concerned: 
       
        
       (a) any person who: 
        
         
        (i) appears as a witness before a court in any criminal proceedings, or to whom any criminal proceedings relate, and 
         
         
        (ii) was a child when the offence to which the proceedings relate was committed, … 
        
       
       
      (1A) The prohibition in subsection (1) applies to the publication or broadcast of the name of a person: 
       
        
       (a) whether the publication or broadcast occurs before or after the proceedings concerned are disposed of, and 
        
        
       (b) even if the person is no longer a child, or is deceased, at the time of the publication or broadcast. 
       
       
      (4) Subsection (1) does not prohibit: 
       
        
       (a) the publication or broadcasting of an official report of the proceedings of a court that includes the name of any person the publication or broadcasting of which would otherwise be prohibited by subsection (1), or 
        
        
       (b) the publication or broadcasting of the name of a person: 
        
         
        (i) in the case of a person who is a child under the age of 16 years at the time of publication or broadcasting – with the consent of the court concerned, or 
         
         
        (ii) in the case of a person who is of or above the age of 16 years at the time of publication or broadcasting – with the consent of the person, or 
        
        
       (c) the publication or broadcasting of the name of a person who has been convicted of a serious indictable offence, if the publication or broadcasting is authorised by a court under section (4B). 
       
       
      (4A) The consent of the court referred to in subsection (4) (b) (i) shall not be given except with the concurrence of the child or (if the child is incapable of giving concurrence) where the court is of the opinion that the pubic interest so requires. 
       
       
      (4B) A court that sentences a person on conviction for a serious children’s indictable offence may, by order made at the time of sentencing, authorise the publication or broadcasting of the name of the person (whether or not the person consents or concurs). 
       
       
      (4C) A court is not to make an order referred to in subsection (4B) unless it is satisfied: 
       
        
       (a) that the making of such an order is in the interests of justice, and 
        
         
        
       (b) that the prejudice to the person arising from the publication or broadcasting of the person’s name in accordance with such an order does not outweigh those interests.”  
       
       
      (4D) The burden of establishing the matters referred to in subsection (4C) (a) and (b) lies on the prosecuting authority. 
       
       
      (4E) A court that makes an order referred to in subsection (4B) must indicate to the person, and make a record of, its reasons for doing so. 
       
       
      (5) For the purposes of this section, a reference to the name of a person includes a reference to any information, picture or other material that identifies the person or is likely to lead to the identification of the person. 
       
       
      (6) For the purposes of this section, a reference to a person who appears as a witness before a court in any criminal proceedings includes a reference to a child who gives evidence in the form of a recording in proceedings in accordance with Part 3 of the  
      Evidence (Children) Act 
       1997. 
       
      
    9. I am informed that the researches of counsel have not revealed any prior authorities that may be of assistance other than Regina v Jay Hart (Hulme J, Supreme Court of NSW, 7 July 2006) and Application by John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd re MSK, MAK, MMK and MRK [2006] NSWCCA 386.10. I should first note the submission that the District Court, where the child was sentenced, is “the court concerned” for the purposes of section 4(b)(i) and that for practical purposes there is no difference between the District Court at Sydney and the District Court at Dubbo. This means that the application is brought in the criminal proceedings in which the child was sentenced at Dubbo District Court. 11. I also note that section 4A envisages that a child under the age of 16 may give concurrence to his or her name being mentioned but then goes on to consider a situation where a child is incapable of giving concurrence, in which case the court must look at whether “the public interest” requires that such an application be brought. Since the child in question has consented, there is no requirement to determine public interest.12. The first issue is whether I can make such an order at all. Section 11(4)(a)(i) sets out a formula for excluding from the prohibition publications made which are a part of official proceedings or with the consent of the person (if the person is over 16) or with the consent of the court concerned. The consent of the court shall not be given under section 11(4A) except, as has occurred here, with the concurrence of the child. However, in Application by John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd re MSK, MAK, MMK and MRK [2006] NSWCCA 386 at [12], the Court of Criminal Appeal held that section 11(4B) cannot be invoked other than during the sentencing process, whether the person is named or not and that the words “by order made at the time of sentencing” were “intractable” (at [12] per Spigelman CJ). Parliament intended to confine applications for an order of this character to the time and to the court which undertook the sentencing task. This section, which intractably forbids later applications, appears to conflict with section 11(4)(1)(i) and (ii), which permit the naming of the child in the circumstances outlined above.13. The applicant relied upon the decision of Hulme J in Regina v Jay Hart, where an order for publication of the names of three deceased children was made although Hulme J does not appear to have been the sentencing judge. This decision was handed down six month before Application by John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd re MSK, MAK, MMK and MRK. The sections referring to the sentencing judge’s role “whether the person consents or not” in section 11(4B), and the process set out in section 4(b)(i) and (ii) where a child over 16 may consent or the “court concerned” can make an order, are difficult to reconcile.14. However, it is not necessary for me to determine whether an application can be brought once the proceedings have been concluded, because the requirements of section 11(1) have first to be satisfied. The name of the child must not be published or broadcast “in a way that connected the person with the criminal proceedings concerned”. In other words, the publication needs to connect (or identify) the child with the actual criminal proceedings concerned.15. That has not happened here. There is nothing in the documentary that identifies the child with “the criminal proceedings concerned”. No information at all is provided in the documentary about what the criminal proceedings were. All that is shown is that the child appears to have made an admission about spending some time in a juvenile centre. The language of the adolescents’ conversation is so general that not much more can be made out of it than that Craig says he is determined “never to go to jail”. 16. The manner in which section 11 functions is not dissimilar to the functioning of section 121 Family Law Act 1975 (Cth), which prohibits the publication of information about Family Court proceedings. The elements of this section were considered in Markisic v AEA Ethnic Publishers Pty Ltd & Ors [2006] NSWCA 378 and at [179] I note one of the submissions made by the respondent, and apparently accepted by the court, was that the account of the appellant kidnapping his daughters was not an “account of any proceedings” in the Family Court and therefore section 121 had no relevance. 17. The purpose of section 11 is to prevent public identification of a minor which connects that minor with the criminal proceedings concerned. In the present case, not only are the criminal proceedings not identified, but the statements made by Craig are equivocal. There has been no breach of section 11 and accordingly I make the following orders:Orders1. Grant leave to file Notice of Motion in the Registry subject to the registry ascertaining from the Dubbo District Court file number(s) for any criminal proceedings brought against Craig Gillon in that court.2. Dispense with service on the DPP by reason of the consent of the respondent Craig Gillon to publication.3. Notice of Motion dismissed.4. These orders to be entered forthwith.

   JUDGMENT1. The defendant in these proceedings comes before me today with two applications. The first is to oppose an application by the plaintiff for leave to amend three of the imputations in the statement of claim and to file an amended pleading inserting the word “sexual” before imputations 4(b), 6(b) and 9(b).2. The orders I have already made in this matter are set out in my judgment Breen v Nationwide News Pty Limited & Ors [2007] NSWDC 192. The plaintiff has already agreed that if leave is granted that the plaintiff will pay the costs thrown away by reason of the amendment. 3. The text of the matter complained of is set out in my judgment in Breen v Nationwide News Pty Limited & Ors. The passages the plaintiff relies upon are essentially the whole of the matter complained of, but in particular, the following in relation to each of publications A, B and C.Publication A:4. The plaintiff draws my attention to the headings “MP’s love for vicious killers”, “Sickening bid to free rapists”. The opening paragraphs refer to the plaintiff having:  
     
     “penned a sickening tribute to the killers of Janine Balding in which he talks about his realisation one night in ‘under the stars’ that he loved two of them.” 
    5. In particular, the matter complained of goes on to say that the plaintiff, who is described as a “controversial MP”, describes the vicious killers in his new book as “having rosy cheeks”, “pleasant smiles” or being “hapless”, and goes on to say that the oldest of the three killers is innocent of the murder, adding: 
     
      
     “Mr Breen calls ‘blue eyed’ Jamieson by his nickname Jamo. He bought him a television for his cell... 
      
      
     “Jamieson is gazing out the high barred window behind me, his eyes reflecting blue sky” is how Mr Breen describes one gaol meeting in his bizarre paperback, researched mainly in parliamentary time...  
      
      
     ‘I love Shorty Jamieson and I'm not afraid to say so’.” 
    Publication B:6. The portions relied on in publication B are again the headline and opening words, which include the reference to the book as being “his sick book” in which he said he “loved two of Janine Balding’s killers”, and goes on to say that he had been ""forced to quit"" the ALP after The Daily Telegraph revealed the “shocking contents” and that the Attorney General’s Office had been asked to step in. Mr Potter draws to my attention to the references at line 37 and line 109 in which the publication asserts that the plaintiff “loves two of the killers of Janine Balding”. Publication C:7. The third matter complained of has Mr Breen quoted as saying he is “sorry if people find this shocking” and there is a reference to acts of cruelty by one of the killers as a child, including animal cruelty, and also a statement that the oldest of the group who has been routinely described in press reports as a “hideous creature” with “ape line features, a flat vacant face, and a strange stunted body” being only 122 centimetres tall with an IQ of 65.The imputations argument8. Each of the three matters complained of sets out the circumstances in which the plaintiff is asserted to have declared his love for the two of the vicious killers of Janine Balding in circumstances where the plaintiff draws to my attention that not only is the plaintiff asserted to have declared his love for another man but it is more than one other man and it is in particular the two vicious killers of Janine Balding which they had been notorious throughout New South Wales, if not Australia, as one of the most dreadful rape and murder cases over the last twenty years at least. 9. Miss Chrysanthou, for the defendants, submits that ""love"" means sexual conduct and not perverse conduct and that what is asserted here is romantic love, not conduct that is capable of being sexually perverse. 10. Miss Chrysanthou draws to my attention the decision of the Court of Appeal in Malcolm v Nationwide News Pty Limited [2007] NSWCA 254. The circumstances of this case were that Simpson J considered that, when regard was had to the entirety of the news article, it was clear beyond what the Court of Appeal calls in its headnote “reasonable doubt” that what was being reported was a suspicion that the person depicted in the photograph was the person who committed the offence. 11. The Court of Appeal, when allowing an appeal from her Honour’s decision striking out an imputation “the appellant had abducted and indecently assaulted a seven year old boy”, reviewed the law relating to capacity, noting firstly the decision of the Court of Appeal in Griffith v John Fairfax Publications (2004) NSWCA 300 concerning imputations under the 1974 Act, then Favell v Queensland Newspapers Pty Limited (2005) 79 ALJR 1716 concerning the position at common law. The Court then came to a consideration of the tests in Sergi v Australian Broadcasting Commission [1983] 2 NSWLR 669 and in Amalgamated Television Services Pty Limited v Marsden (1998) 43 NSWLR 158. 12. The publication in Malcolm was made on 29 June 2005. The publications that are before me now are 2006 publications. Accordingly these matters fall within the ambit of the Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) which commences in relation to actions after 1 January 2006. 13. Beazley J in Malcolm considered that the test for imputations was as follows: 
     
     “20. Thus in  
     Sergi v Australian Broadcasting Commission 
       
     [1983] 2 NSWLR 669 Glass JA at 674 stated that the question whether the imputation was conveyed should go to the jury unless it was blindingly obvious that no other conclusion was reasonably open. In  
     Amalgamated Television Services v Marsden 
       
     (1998) 43 NSWLR 158 Hunt CJ at CL (Mason P and Handley JA agreeing) stated at 164-165 that if reasonable persons may differ as to the conclusions to be drawn from the matter complained of, the issue as to whether the imputation was in fact conveyed must be left to the jury”. 
    14. Miss Chrysanthou submits to me that this is a break with the use of the General Steel test, a case which has been referred to by Nicholas J in relation to a number of decisions his Honour has handed down on capacity. 15. Prior to the Defamation Act 2005 the General Steel test was not referred to in capacity arguments other than capacity arguments in relation to extrinsic facts, those being matters of pleading. What Miss Chrysanthou submits to me that the Court of Appeal is doing in Malcolm is drawing back from the General Steel test on the basis that it is necessary to establish that it is “reasonable”. In other words, if reasonable persons may differ, in some way this imposes a higher test than the General Steel test. 16. It is my view that the District Court should in the interests of judicial comity follow the decisions of Nicholas J and the Supreme Court. Miss Chrysanthou has told me that there has been a recent case which unfortunately is not available where Nicholas J has resiled from the use of the General Steel test and has preferred to follow Malcolm v Nationwide News Pty Limited. 17. However Mr Potter tells me, and I agree, that I do not need to worry about this apparent conflict as to what the test is, because on any test there is sufficient in each of the matters complained of for him to be able to persuade me that his client should be granted leave to amend to plead these imputations. 18. When one looks at the question of what is a matter for the jury it is hard to think of a better area for jury determination than issues about whether expressing love for two convicted killers is indeed romantic love, or is a perverse sexual attraction. This is a quintessential jury question. A jury can make a decision that is based on community values and their understanding of what the ordinary reasonable reader would make of such an article. Sometimes juries have returned answers of this kind which have surprised lawyers; for example, famously in one case, the jury held that an imputation that the plaintiff, Dr Cairns, felt “a kind of love” for a Miss Morosi was not defamatory. These are matters for which we have juries. This is a quintessential jury question and in my view, whatever the test may be, the loose language of the matter complained of and the certainty that the ordinary reasonable reader would draw inferences and read between the lines mean that there is ample evidence from the text of each of the matters complained of to warrant this amendment.The costs application19. The second application brought by the defendant is in relation to the issue of costs arising from my judgment of [2007] NSWDC 192. This application is brought under the Slip Rule (Uniform Civil Procedure Rules Part 36 r 17), on the basis that I erred in finding that the plaintiff had identified substantial flaws in the defence which necessitated re-pleading (at [68] of my judgment).20. The word “substantial” was not a word of my using, it was a word of Mr Leopold’s adoption, as I note from transcript p 1 line 26 where Mr Leopold said there were “substantial changes” and that he did not seek to press the defence any longer, which of course meant that he was relying on the amended defence that was before me. Miss Chrysanthou tells me that she read [68] of my judgment as meaning that the plaintiff in the course of argument before me identified substantial flaws in the defence that was before me which necessitated re-pleading. But all I was doing was reciting matters of history which are set out more fully in my judgment at [9] where I said this: 
     
      
     “When the matter came before me, the plaintiff provided written submissions identifying a number of errors in the pleading and particularisation of comment. Rather than answer this, the defendant sought leave to amend and provided a draft defence. Some of the proposed amendments appear to be inconsistent with the defence of contextual truth (particularly in regard to imputations 4(b), 6(b), 9(b) and 11(b)) and the document bears the signs of a hastily drafted document. I have taken this into account when formulating my orders and also in relation to costs. In addition, Mr Leopold made some concessions during the argument which necessitated my ordering the transcript to ensure I had recorded them correctly.” 
    21. The defendant complains, with some justification, that they were successful to a large degree, Miss Chrysanthou in fact submitted they were entirely successful in their application before me to oppose the plaintiff’s application to strike out the defence of comment. 22. However, in exercising my discretion as to costs, I heard submissions from the parties and I made an order which took into account the history of the matter rather than separating out the acknowledgment and concessions by the defendant that they would pay the costs thrown away, and I also took into account the lateness with which the amended pleading had been filed and the fact that there were some unspecified number of matters still requiring correction. Miss Chrysanthou says that the amended defence was filed on the date by which submissions are due and that is correct. However, essentially what she objects to is that I took a global approach to costs rather than an issue by issue approach to costs and that is not a matter which, in my view, could fall within the slip rule because it requires the exercise of a discretion. It is not a subject matter about which no real difference of opinion can exist. Essentially what I am being asked to do is to revisit my earlier costs order. 23. Miss Chrysanthou initially sought an order for costs in her clients’ favour. It was drawn to her attention by Mr Potter that when costs were argued before me Mr Leopold did not ask for costs; he asked for no order as to costs or costs in the cause. Thus Miss Chrysanthou was asking for more costs than her learned leader, as he now is, had sought. She has since resiled from this position and now asks me to make the order that Mr Leopold sought. It seems to me that this is effectively asking me to re-exercise my discretion as to costs in circumstances where there is no new material before me, apart from one minor exception to which I will shortly refer. 24. In Manning v Nominal Defendant [2000] NSWCA 80 and a number of other decisions which follow on from Brimaud v Honeysett Instant Print Pty Ltd (New South Wales Supreme Court, 19 September 1988, unreported), the courts have warned against the re-hearing of interlocutory applications on issues such as costs. Miss Chrysanthou did draw to my attention that the amendments that had to be made as a result of the typographical errors to which Mr Leopold referred at p 35 in fact were only two in number and I must say, if Mr Leopold had told me that when I was making my costs order, that might have given me occasion to consider such a request. But, in circumstances where nobody told me how many typographical errors there were, where the document was rather hastily prepared, where there was some crossing out going on when the matter was before me and that I was a bit unsure about the nature of the concession that Mr Leopold eventually formally made in court and had to take out the transcript, I took the view that the costs thrown away by reason of the amendment and the costs of the hearing were so inextricably tied up that the best step was to regard them as being indivisible. To unscramble the omelette and say that some costs went under one heading and other costs under another, in my view, would not be warranted in an application of an interlocutory nature in relation to the amending of a defence. 25. My discretion as to costs is unfettered: Cretazzo v Lombardi (1975) 16 SASR 1. I note in this decision the learned judges of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia warned against the parcelling out of costs under individual headings and considered the desirability of making global orders as to costs. 26. Accordingly I reject the submission that I have in some way fallen into an error requiring correction under the Slip Rule. I decline to exercise my discretion to revisit the costs order. But, in the event that I have erred, I have set out the matters which, if I were to revisit the costs order, should make it clear that I would make the same order again. 27. The orders that I will make in these proceedings are as follows:(1) Grant the plaintiff leave to file and serve a further amended statement of claim.(2) The plaintiff pay the costs thrown away by reason of the amendment to the statement of claim.(3) Defendant’s application under the Slip Rule in relation to order 2 of the judgment of 4 October 2007 is dismissed.(4) The defendant is to pay the plaintiff’s costs of the argument today.(5) Orders as per paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of the short minutes of order.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Michael Motuliki committed the offence, for which he must now be sentenced the day after he turned eighteen; that means that he is to be dealt with as an adult and serve the sentence of imprisonment I must impose, in an adult prison.2 The period of custody that I must necessarily impose upon the offender will not be easy for him, nor will it be easy for his family; a loving family who have now suffered two awful losses. Firstly, the death of their oldest son, and now the incarceration of their middle son. In many respects, the matter before me today is terribly sad; but, ultimately it must be recognised that Mr Motuliki has committed a very serious offence. 3 There are a number of aggravated circumstances of which I will mention, and the result is that, even though it necessarily adds to the tragedy this family suffered, he must spend a considerable period of time in custody. 4 The offender went out with some friends of his to celebrate his eighteenth birthday. That celebration involved the consumption of drugs and alcohol. The following day, Saturday 24 July 2010, they recommenced consuming drugs and alcohol. The offender and his friend decided that they would get something to eat; they went to a hot bread shop in Bankstown; they asked for food. 5 When the cash register was opened after the offenders handed over payment, the offender decided that he would rob the shop attendant; a twenty-six year old young lady. The offender reached around and started to remove money from the cash register, using both his hands. The shop attendant screamed, “Help, robbery”. There was another person in the shop, a twenty year-old man; he came out to assist. The offender saw him coming and punched him in the head using a closed fist, then continued to punch him in the head using both of his fists, hitting him in the mouth. The young man stumbled backwards, trying to cover up his face with his hands.6 The offender did not stop; he continued to punch the young man numerous times until he stumbled out the front of the shop. The offender ran away and got on a bus; an eye-witness who saw what happened wrote down the details of the bus and contacted triple-0. 7 An ambulance was called to assist the young man. He had lost one of his upper-front teeth in the course of the violence that was inflicted upon him; he suffered a deep cut that required stitching. Two other teeth were loose as well; he needed treatment from a dentist to fix the two loose teeth and replace the missing tooth. The offender was arrested by police a few days later, on 28 July 2010. The offender admitted what he had done; he expressed his remorse when he spoke to police; he has been in custody since then. 8 I mentioned before that there are a number of aggravating circumstances for this offence. One in particular concerned the fact that the offender was on two forms of conditional liberty at the time ;a twelve-month probation order and an eight-month suspended control order, both imposed in the Parramatta Children’s Court. These were for offences of a broadly similar nature to the offending for which the offender must now be sentenced. The offender is currently serving sentences of imprisonment as a result of the revocation of the probation order and suspended control order, such that he is not eligible to be released to parole until 28 August 2011. 9 I mentioned before that the offender was under the influence of alcohol and drugs at the time of this offence; but it could not be said that these caused him to act out-of-character, as his previous offences indicate, thus the benefit that the offender can claim for having being under the offence of illegal drugs and alcohol is limited indeed.10 The offender gave evidence today and said that, at the time of his eighteenth birthday, he was depressed because his older brother was not with him to help him celebrate; that can easily be accepted. The tragic death of his older brother is, according to his father, who gave evidence today, and - this seems to be confirmed in the presentence report - what led to the offender, to use the colloquialism “going off the rails”. It was after his brother was murdered the offender began drinking to excess, taking drugs and committing offences. There was a relatively-short period of offending, starting with the serious matters in October 2009; then one of the other offences, committed shortly before his eighteenth birthday, that being on 18 July 2010; and then this matter, committed, as I said, on 24 July 2010. This short period of offending suggests that he has good prospects of rehabilitation.11 Part of his rehabilitation will be an important aspect of the sentence I will shortly impose upon him, personal deterrence. The offender needs to have brought it home to him in a very concrete way, that offences such as those he has committed, and, in particular, the one for which I must now sentence him, are very serious indeed. The maximum penalty of the offence committed by the offender is twenty-five years’ imprisonment, reflecting the seriousness with which the legislature regards this sort of behaviour. It is rare indeed for an eighteen year-old to commit such serious offences; personal deterrence is particularly important, given the offender’s recent lifestyle. 12 The offender is fortunate indeed to have the support of his family; both his parents are here in Court today, as well as two of his friends. There are, thus, as I said, good prospects for the offender’s future, but it remains the case that he must be punished for what he has done.13 The question of accumulation is fairly important; I will commence the sentence at the expiry of the existing non-parole period, so the sentence will start on 28 August 2011. But I have applied, of course, the principle of totality, so the sentence I am actually going to impose is less than it would otherwise have been. I am able to apply the principle of totality because of the helpful information provided to me by the Crown concerning the earlier offences. The sentence that I will announce is also less than it otherwise would have been, because of the offender’s early plea of guilty. I have discounted the sentence, thus, by twenty-five per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of that plea.14 There is much that is promising about the offender’s future. He has had several positions of employment; he was in fact employed before he was arrested. He has plans to obtain his forklift licence in the future; his father is qualified in that area, and will obviously be able to assist. He is to take responsibility for his actions..(not transcribable).. reflection of the Parole Officer, his behaviour is a cowardly act. 15 There are clearly special circumstances in this case, most obviously his youth; the fact that this sentence will be accumulated on existing sentences; the need for the offender to deal with his drug and alcohol abuse, and also the need for counselling concerning the death of his older brother. His mother gave evidence that, after the offender’s older brother was murdered, the family was offered counselling. His mother accepted that offer, the offender did not - regarding himself as strong enough to cope; in hindsight it may have been a mistake. Given the age of the offender the mistake is quite understandable. 16 So the non-parole period that I will shortly announce has been reduced to what it would otherwise have been, to allow for an extended period of supervision on parole, during which counselling can be offered to the offender. It remains the case, however, that even an offender as young as the prisoner needs to be punished, and significantly so for a very serious offence. The violence in this case was ongoing, it was not simply a case of punching the young man and running away; there were numerous blows, leading to a significant injury, all in the course of the offending, escaping from ..(not transcribable).. robbery at a time when he had been extended leniency by the Children’s Court, with already similar offences. Thus the period of imprisonment that I will now announce is, in some respects, a lengthy one but is the least which, in my opinion, properly reflects the circumstances of this case.17 The offender is sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years to commence on 28 August 2011, a head sentence of four years. The non-parole period will expire on 27 August 2013, on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole.

   JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: Samir Zaoui hit upon a remarkably simple way of defrauding people of money. He would go into a small business, usually a pizza store or something similar, and say that his car had broken down, it needed a new battery and the NRMA wanted some money to replace the battery. He must have been quite convincing because he seems to have been very successful. There are more than fifty occasions when the offender has, through those means, obtained money from people by that deception. On occasions there was not enough money in the till to pay him the money that he required and so employees would provide their own money. On one occasion he even went with an employee to an ATM, it did not work so they went to a second ATM before finally the employee handed over $400. This money appears to have been spent by Mr Zaoui on drugs. He was an industrious, hardworking conman. 2 The magistrate dealing with these very many offences dealt with them in various ways, but they ultimately ended up with an effective sentence of imprisonment of two years with a non-parole period of eighteen months. That is, there was no finding of special circumstances made. The offender has a long term drug history and has been provisionally accepted into Odyssey House. Ms Neil asks that I make a finding of special circumstances, extend the period of eligibility of the parole at the expense of the non-parole period, but nevertheless order that it be a condition of his parole that he enter into residential drug rehabilitation. Of course, that could mean that the offender actually spends longer in custody than he would at present. If, for example, when his non-parole period expires there is no suitable residential rehabilitation program for him, or he does not qualify for some particular reason, he will do two years in custody rather than eighteen months as is presently the case. Ms Neil spoke to her client about that and Mr Zaoui indicated his willingness and indeed a desire to have his non-parole period reduced and his period of eligibility for parole extended on the firm understanding that he would only get parole if he entered residential rehabilitation.3 In view of the benefits not only to Mr Zaoui but also to the community, in particular small businesses, if Mr Zaoui is able to deal with his drug problems I propose to grant Ms Neil’s application. 4 The order I make, in relation to the offences for which imprisonment was imposed, with a commencement date of 24 March 2010, the appeals are dismissed.5 For each of the offences for which sentences of imprisonment were imposed to commence on 24 March 2011 the appeals are allowed. I sentence the offender to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of four months to date from 24 March 2011 and a head sentence of twelve months. This means that the non-parole period will expire on 23 July 2011. 6 As well as the normal conditions of parole it is Mr Zaoui’s release to parole is conditional on him entering and remaining at a residential drug rehabilitation program upon his release from custody, and that the period of residential rehabilitation be determined by the Probation and Parole authority in consultation with the provider of the residential rehabilitation program.7 I direct that whilst in custody he is to be provided with assistance by the prison authorities in determining an appropriate residential rehabilitation and in making necessary application for that rehabilitation program.

   JUDGMENT 1. On seven occasions between 1 March 2008 and 19 July 2008 this appellant committed 11 offences for which the Local Court imposed penalties. One of them was a fine in respect of drive with minimum range PCA on 1 March 2008. The appellant has withdrawn that appeal. The others are all offences for which he received suspended sentences ranging between 20 months on one hand and four months on the other.2. The appellant appeals against all of those sentences and that leaves now, with the one withdrawn, ten appeals outstanding. Included among the facts before me in respect of one offence is the following: 
     
      
      “In the early hours of Tuesday 6 March police were patrolling the streets around East Moree when they observed a woman well affected by alcohol walking along the streets exhibiting obvious injuries and obvious signs of distress. Police now know this woman to be the victim in this matter. She was in fact the victim of an offence at the hands of her partner. The victim refused to tell police what had happened and how she became injured. She requested police give her a lift to a residence known to police in Moree. Police conveyed her to the requested address. She told police that she would ring them in the morning if she wished to advise police of the incident.” 
      
    3. It would appear the assaults against this appellant's partner were so severe and unremitting that she fled her house. Her home is supposed to be of all places in the world the one she should feel most secure and safe in. That she should be driven from it by her male partner who, one he would have thought, should be offering her, as part of the relationship, caring, safety and protection from violence, suggests he is necessarily failing miserably in understanding what is involved in a long term relationship between a man and a woman.4. The appellant and his partner are both indigenous Australians. Domestic violence is said to be rampant within indigenous communities. One of the surest ways to stamp it out is to report each and every occasion it occurs. Many Aboriginal leaders are calling upon the indigenous community to accept accountability for their way of life, including the level of domestic violence. Many women do not report domestic violence. Why that is so should be explored and faced up to by the victims of domestic violence. It may be a sense of shame or even guilt. It may be because they feel they have contributed to it. It may be because they love their partner and hope it will not happen again. It may be because they cannot bear the thought of loss both emotional and financial to them and their children that imprisonment for domestic violence may cause. All are powerful motives for failing to report but failing to report will only lead to continued perpetration. Certainty of being charged is the greatest deterrent to offending behaviour including domestic violence.5. Think about the speed camera. Those who know it is there, slow down. They don't wish to be caught speeding. Failure to report is what the perpetrator of domestic violence hopes for, because then he will not be held accountable to the community and to his partner for his offending conduct.6. There are other ways partners can lessen domestic violence against them. Alcohol consumption is recognised as the silent but powerful contributor to domestic violence. Drunken, disinhibited, argumentive belittling and other aggressive behaviour are all close companions of alcohol waiting to be released from the human persona by a few drinks.7. Reporting domestic violence takes courage. I acknowledge the courage of women who refuse to put up with domestic violence, including on this occasion this offender's partner. It together with reduction of alcohol intake are two giant steps to reducing domestic violence within the Aboriginal community.8. Can I come back to this, of the first offences, that the appellant is appealing from. The sentence for this offence was 20 months suspended conditional upon him entering into a bond to be after of good behaviour.9. There are seven children to the relationship between he and his partner.All of them reside with the appellant in Moree. There is no doubt from what I have seen of the appellant and what he has told me, that he wishes to be, and probably is when he isn't drunk, a loving and caring father. Clearly his children by and large love him. Although as will be seen later one of them is beginning to have problems.10. On 15 March 2008 the appellant and his partner were drinking at friends' house nearby. At 4 o'clock she returned home expecting the arrival of the children. The appellant remained with friends and continued drinking. He returned home at 6.30. The appellant, his partner and friends continued drinking at his home, with the children and his partner coming and going from the residence. After some time the appellant left and didn't return for some three hours. When he arrived home at about midnight, his partner and he became involved in an argument regarding the absence of the appellant for those three hours. This argument quickly escalated with the appellant punching and kicking his partner several times. She fell to the ground but he continued striking her on the face, right ear, right shoulder, legs and mouth. 11. It was she who ultimately left the house and was picked up by police. She thought overnight as to whether she would consult police, and the following morning she contacted them. 12. Police noticed that her forehead was swollen and red, her right ear was substantially bruised, as was her tongue and lower lip. There were several cuts on the lower lip on the inside near the tooth line. She showed police a bruise on her right shoulder, claiming she had been kicked by the appellant. She had a visible abrasion to her right lower shoulder blade. Photographs were taken of the injuries, and she was advised to seek medical attention. 13. I have seen the photographs, and they do the appellant no credit at all. 14. When questioned in relation to the allegation, the appellant said: ""I only hit her because she hit me"". I have no reason to doubt that he was struck by his wife, but I fail to see that as a valid reason striking her back. 15. After that offence, at 4:30pm on 7 March, which would be I think the day following, or a couple of days following, at Moree the appellant was at a Caltex service station. The appellant's car was there. It had no registration plates, and indeed was uninsured. Four people were in the vehicle. The appellant being one of them. Police approached it. Some police officers were already speaking to the driver of this vehicle. The appellant attempted to intervene in the conversation. He was unsteady on his feet, smelt of intoxicating liquor, and had slurred speech. He said to the police: ""Why don't you fuck off and leave us alone"". He was told to sit in the rear of the Commodore while police spoke to the driver. I am assuming that the police were investigating what they believed to be a driving offence. 16. The appellant failed to comply with the direction. He approached the police officer who had spoken to him, Constable Edwards, and put his hand on that man's right shoulder. Edwards took a step back for the purposes of creating a distance between himself and the appellant. He again asked the appellant to sit in the rear of the Commodore. Two other occupants, that is his mates sought to get the appellant to sit in the back of the Commodore. He moved away from them, and said to the police: ""Why don't youse fuck off. You're always picking on the innocent ones. This is my car"". 17. There was a further attempt to get the appellant to sit in the vehicle. He said: ""You think you're tough just because you're bigger than me"". He then said: ""How about you and I have a go""; directing those comments to the constable who initially told him to sit in the vehicle, Constable Edwards. 18. The appellant was about half a metre from Edwards, raised his hands to chest height. Constable Edwards took action, believing that the appellant was shaping up as though to fight. He grabbed the appellant by the left arm with reasonable force, pushed the appellant face down on the ground. He was then placed under arrest. The appellant was placed in the rear of the police vehicle and he was cautioned. He persisted: ""What the hell are you arresting me for, I ain't done nothing, you're always arresting the innocent ones"". 19. He was taken to the police station. A female constable was in charge of or at least filling in paperwork in the charge room. The appellant was in the dock at this time, and she was attempting to obtain details, including his name and the like. The appellant's response to her approach was to pull his pants down exposing his penis to her. 20. That seems to me an act of utter contempt and disrespect towards a woman. I am sure he would not have done that had the police officer been a male. 21. He said: ""What are you charging me with?"" She explained to the appellant what he was to be charged with. He then said to her: ""You're nothing but a redneck cunt. I've been in this country longer than you. What fucking boat did you come on?"" 22. It may well be true that the appellant's race has been in this country much longer than she, or the Europeans, but it would not necessarily be true that he had been in this country much longer than she. Indeed in the process of reconciliation there is no way that all the whites are going to, or are even wanted by the Aboriginal community, to leave this country. That sort of comment doesn't advance the cause of reconciliation at all. What we need to do in reconciliation is to be more caring and more aware of the needs of both sides. 23. There is further swearing at the constable. 24. In respect of those charges the appellant was sentenced to suspended sentences. I think of five months. 25. That was a charge of intimidated police. 26. The next offence that I am dealing with are offences that occurred on 4 April 2008, and they relate to a failure to comply with bail undertaking, an offence for which he could have been penalised (sic- read ""charged"") in any event, at least when it's made under that section, by knowingly contravene a prohibited restriction specified in an order. That is, contravene a domestic violence order. On two occasions police were called to his premises at a time when he was there in circumstances where he was not to assault, molest, harass, threaten or otherwise interfere with his partner, or not engage in any conduct that intimidated her. More particularly, not reside at the premises of 11 Ulunga Street, and not enter the premises, or any other premises at which his partner might work or reside. And he was also required to report to police. 27. On 4 April, about 7:10, she was at the premises, and the daughter, this is Ida Swan, the ten year old, said to police: ""Dad is always hitting mum. I don't want to stay here no more. I hate it when he hits her"".28. Children often have an innate sense of what is right and what is wrong. The appellant's partner said that he had approached her and entered the premises, contravening his order. There was an argument that started about, which she called, 'silly things'. He called her names, and followed her through to the kitchen into the bedroom. She said to him, ""Get away, you're not allowed near the house"", and rang the police; and to his credit he then left the house. He should not have been there, but at least he had the sense to leave once she had rung the police. 29. Two days later, on 6 April, they attended and spoke to her. Police could hear the appellant saying: ""Don't let them in"". They said: ""We can hear you in there, come out and get this sorted out today"". He said: ""Don't open the door"". They stayed there for ten minutes talking to him, and he said: ""All right, I'm coming out"". He came out the front door ultimately and was arrested. 30. His memory of that is now faulty, because he thought that he hadn't come out, and he was telling me that he wasn't there that day. 31. Those two matters, that is the one on the 4th, and the one on the 6th, were breaches of domestic violence orders. For the one he got four months. 32. Another offence of assault a number of police officers, assault police officers in the execution of their duty, intimidate police officers, two charges, and behave in an offensive manner near a school or a public place. 33. The facts of those offences occurred in these circumstances: About 11:50pm, that is ten minutes to midnight, on 31 May two constables, Whitebread and Wiley, were conducting a mobile RBT on Alice street. They heard a male screaming for help, and saw him running in a westerly direction towards police on Alice Street. That was Andrew Swan, who is the third son. He was being chased by a brother, who had a two-foot long metal pole, white in colour, which had previously been the handle of a shopping trolley. That was the elder brother, Wayne Swan; the 17 year old twin. He said: ""Come here cunt, you're fucking coming home"". Police told him to throw down the bar, and there was interaction between young Wayne Swan and the police. That continued for some minutes, and at one point Wayne was fairly close to his brother Andrew, but still resisting police. 34. A second vehicle came, and the appellant and his partner emerged from that vehicle. They then began to wrestle with police, yelled out offensive things such as: ""Let me go you white cunts. Fucking let him go you white cunts. Fuck off, this is a family thing"". The appellant continued to hinder the police, and continued to wrestle with them. He also continued to swear at them. 35. The appellant was ultimately arrested and led towards the rear of the police vehicle. He was told what he was under arrest for, which was hinder and assault police. Meanwhile the son, Wayne, was in the back of the police vehicle. Both the appellant and his son yelled at police. They were told that they would be sprayed if they continued to carry on. 36. They were placed into the rear of the police vehicle, and the son would seem to have been trying to get out of the vehicle. The appellant then said: ""Let us all go or I'm going to smash both you cunts"". That didn't happen. He then said, ""right then"", and rushed towards the still open rear cage door towards police. Constable Whitebread said: ""Get back Wayne"". The appellant continued to rush and was sprayed directly into his eyes. 37. The son, not surprisingly, caring for his father, also lost it, and he too rushed to the police swearing at them. A second burst of spray was directed into his eyes, and consequently when they went to the police station ambulance officers had to decontaminate them. An observation made was that in the opinion of police he was well affected by alcohol, as he was in all the other offences. 38. On 17 July he was arrested for being in breach of the bail. 9pm on 18 July police attend his home to conduct a bail compliance check. They were told that he was across the road watching football. They spoke to him about being absent from his residence after the curfew. 39. On 19 July there was a need for them to go to Sullivan Place in Moree. Police heard that the appellant was involved, in whatever was going on at Sullivan Place, so they went to Ulunga Street to conduct a bail compliance check. They were told he was not at the address. At 4am they received another call to attend Sullivan Place. When they got there they were told that the appellant and his family had just left. One of those apparently at the party, Lenair Duncan, came to report some malicious damage to her vehicle. She had been driving out of Sullivan Place with some others and this appellant and his son were seen standing by the side of the road with their arms raised.As she went by, Miss Duncan heard two thuds against her vehicle sounding like bottles smashing. She immediately came to the station. The damage (to her vehicle) was said to be about $100.40. The police went to Ulunga Street to locate the appellant. He and his partner were told that they were under arrest. The appellant said well just wait until I get changed. Then once inside, well inside the house, (he was always inside), the front door was closed and locked.41. The appellant locked himself inside the residence, refusing to come out. Police threatened to break the door. Ultimately he came out smelling strongly of alcohol. 42. On 18 July the appellant was at a 50th birthday party at 24 Sullivan Place and it seems he approached someone looking for a third person by the name of Mark. The appellant was after Mark because he thought Mark was keen to belt up one of his sons. There was an altercation between the man he spoke to who was described in this statement of facts as victim 2 and the appellant. The appellant with clenched right fist punched this man to the left cheekbone, causing pain. There were several other punches thrown at that man, who tried to defend himself.43. The offender has a bit of a record, but it is over a number of years. In a sense, although there are a substantial number on entries on it, most of his offending has been dealt with in the Local Court. Indeed, these offences (before me) were also dealt with in the Local Court.44. During his evidence it was determined that there were 18 offences in his history where alcohol had been a component. He is 40 years old. He looks to me to be a very fit and, as I have said to him, fairly impressive aboriginal man. He has been married for 23 years to the same partner. They have seven children. They had relocated to Moree from Brisbane. There is another son from a prior relationship. He comes down to the family periodically, but not so often that the appellant, when asked how many children he had, forgot to mention this one. 45. He said in his own childhood he experienced a stable and supporting family environment during his developmental years. He has had some difficulty with school but to his credit, having left in Year 9, he did a four or five year carpentry apprenticeship. Because he has difficulty with numeracy and literacy he was never able to complete final exams for tests that would give him the Trade Certificate. I have no doubt he has skills in carpentry.46. He has worked in a number of unskilled and semi-skilled vocations since leaving school. Indeed, one of his strong points is that he does have a reasonable work ethnic; that is, he doesn't mind a bit of work.47. He told Probation and Parole that he had consumed a considerable amount of alcohol prior to the first of the offences that I have dealt with and denied that his general use of alcohol was problematic.48. Some time has been spent today in questioning both by Mr Crown and perhaps more than I should usually do by me to persuade him that alcohol is a problem that he has because it is linking him to his offending behaviour.49. He commenced using alcohol at the age of 16 and the observation of the author of this pre-sentence report is that there is a strong correlation – connection, between his alcohol use and his criminal behaviour. He told her he drinks two or three times weekly and his partner not surprisingly would support him, says it is not considered problematic by her. She too is abusing or seems to be abusing alcohol from what I have seen of the facts in this matter.50. One of the toughest things for a person who is wanting to give up an addiction is to do it on his own when some member of the family persists in that same addictive behaviour.51. The offender does have the benefit of a close family network and maintains employment when it is available. The observation of Probation and Parole was that his behaviour when consuming alcohol is less than acceptable - I think a proposition he would not disagree with. They recommended that he have alcohol education and incorporating harm minimisation and counselling. 52. There is another pre-sentence report later in time where the appellant's attitude to his drinking habit had actually changed a bit. On 23 September this year he was acknowledging the link between his alcohol consumption and offending. He said that while the family was living in Brisbane he abstained from alcohol for several years, which his partner confirmed. If he did it once he can do it again. Upon return to Moree, he said that he gradually drifted into a pattern of drinking to excess.53. What I intend to do is to give him a chance to prove that he can rehabilitate. I am going to give him bail pursuant to s11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and not finalise these matters until perhaps as far as a year away, although I said to him while he was in the witness box that if he did really well I would bring the finalisation date forward. The conditions are these: 
     
     That he is to be of good behaviour. 
     He is to reside at the Roy Throne Rehabilitation Centre until the completion of the program he is currently on. 
    54. I should have mentioned that he is seeking to address his addictive behaviour although he has perhaps not been entirely frank with those at Roy Throne about the depth of his problem with alcohol. Hopefully after today he might go back and remind them that he does really have alcohol issues. 
     
     Once the Roy Thorn program is completed, he is to reside at 11 Ulunga Street Moree. If there be any restriction to him so residing that restriction is lifted for the purposes of this bail. 
     For the two months immediately following his completion of the program he is to attend the Roy Thorn Rehabilitation Program Monday to Friday from 9 to 5 for two months. 
     He is to accept supervision by Probation and Parole and accept all reasonable directions from his case manager. 
     He is to abstain from the consumption of alcoholic beverages for the duration of the bail. 
     He is to abstain from the consumption of all non-prescription drugs, save for cigarettes of course, for the duration of the bail. 
     He is to submit to random breath tests and random urine tests conducted by Roy Thorn or at the direction of Probation and Parole for the purposes of detecting consumption of alcohol or illicit drugs. The detection of alcohol or illicit drugs is deemed a breach of bail. 
     He will submit to random urinalysis no more than four times monthly for the purpose of detecting illicit drugs. 
     He is to attend Alcoholics Anonymous once fortnightly here in Moree.  
     A refusal to participate in the drug urine tests will be deemed a breach of bail; any dirty drug urine test will be deemed a breach of bail. The supply of a urine source from another person will be deemed a breach of bail. 
     He is, at the completion of the six-month period of his program with Roy Thorn, to seek employment. That means look. It doesn't mean you have to get one but you have to look for one. If you can't get one it is not a breach but if you can get one then you are supposed to get one.  
     To seek a position of employment and if he obtains the position do all he can to maintain employment. 
     He is to provide proof of all of the activities that form part of his bail conditions when he comes to Court. 
     He is to attend Court at the times required by the Court, which will be, all things being equal, on four more occasions, unless we hear of an infraction in which case I might have to increase it. I want to be notified within 48 hours of any breach. 
    55. We will get that bail for you now. I stand this matter over for 12 months. I will have my first progress report at the hearings commencing on 9 March here next year. 56. You won't need to come on 9 March but you will need to come some time during that fortnight just to tell me what you are doing and how you are doing. You by that time will have been out for about three months and I will be very interested to see if you can stay drug free and alcohol free. I ought to also indicate that in the event that the appellant is successful I will review the need to impose a sentence of imprisonment at all in respect of all offences.

     Judgment 
    [1] This morning I heard argument as to the form, capacity and defamatory meaning of three of the four imputations pleaded by the plaintiff and dismissed the application to strike them out. As I have a number of matters in the list this morning, the parties kindly agreed that I could hand down my reasons for decision later today.[2] The plaintiff by way of Statement of Claim brings proceedings for defamation under the Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) for a broadcast on 14 May 2009 on the Steve Price programme when Steve Price and Peter Ford had the conversation set out in Annexure A to the Statement of Claim. The relevant extract of the conversation is as follows:

       …But can I just make one other point that I think is being lost in the wash here. What I think is actually quite an incredible and serious story.

       Peter Ford 
       Yeah. She sets herself up to do this stuff and to put people together, presumably all willing participants, except she’s claiming that there are NRL players who are seeking out underage girls, and one particular player’s house is where they meet and where the underage sex takes place.Now if she has this information, well for a start the media should be onto it, and secondly the police ought to be onto it as well because she’s claiming she has knowledge of NRL players having sex with underage girls in a very organised fashion. 
       
       
       19 
       Steve Price 
       Yeah well the police ought to investigate that. Thanks, Peter. 
       
      
    [3] The plaintiff has pleaded the following imputations: 
     
     (a) The Plaintiff is a slut (paragraph 17). 
      
      
     (b) (i) The Plaintiff is a Madam (14). 
      
       
        
        OR 
        
       
      (ii) The Plaintiff runs a brothel (14). 
      
      
     (c) The Plaintiff puts NRL players and underage girls together for sex (18). 
      
      
     (d) The Plaintiff condones NRL players having sex with underage girls in a very organised fashion (18). 
    [4] The context in which the matter complained of was published is the circumstances in which a football player, named Matthew Johns, had been the subject of a Four Corners programme. It is evident, particularly from the comments made at paragraph 11 by Steve Price, that there is considerable sympathy for Mr Johns, Mr O’Keefe, Mr Newman and other footballers who had been disciplined, in the context of it being unusual for a free to air TV network to sack a major star as opposed to cover up the indiscretion.[5] Mr Ford then goes on to say that he wants to make another point which he thinks is being “lost in the wash” and that is the “incredible and serious story” that was not used on Four Corners for time reasons, namely the story about the plaintiff who is setting herself up as a match maker or madam (or as a slut, according to Steve Price) to put people together including underage girls. Both Mr Ford and Mr Price say that this matter ought to be investigated by the police.[6] The defendant’s application is to challenge the form and capacity of imputations (b), (c) and (d).[7] The way in which applications to strike out imputations should be dealt with has been explained by the High Court in Favell v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd (2005) 79 ALJR 1716 at [10] – [12]. In particular, imputations need to be considered in the context of the article: Ahmed v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 6 at [14]. That is particularly important in a case such as this, which is redolent with innuendo.Imputation (b)[8] On the issue of form, the defendant submits that the way in which imputations (b)(i) and (b)(ii) are pleaded in the alternative, is impermissible and that the plaintiff should elect one imputation or the other. The defendant further submits that these imputations are incapable of being defamatory and also that imputation (b)(ii) is incapable of arising.[9] The entitlement of a plaintiff to plead a “fallback imputation” of lesser seriousness is well-established. An imputation of guilt, for example, may have as a “fallback” an imputation of suspicion: a typical example is Maitland v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2001] NSWSC 376.[10] A brothel “madam”, according to Merriam-Webster’s Online Dictionary, means “the female head of a house of prostitution”. It connotes not simply ownership of a brothel, but active, indeed enthusiastic, participation in its daily activities. It is an imputation of greater seriousness than merely conducting a business which operates a brothel. Whether the matter complained of conveys one or the other should be a matter for the jury.[11] Mr Dawson next argued that it was not defamatory to say of a person that they operated a brothel or worked as a prostitute, as such conduct is not illegal.[12] By analogy, it is not illegal, in New South Wales, to carry on business as an abortionist, but that does not mean that the allegation of being an abortionist cannot be defamatory. In Hepburn v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [1983] 2 NSWLR 682 at 686 Hutley JA explained: 
     
      
     “The fact that some reasonable members of the public may regard the defamatory aura which surrounds any abortion as the result of prejudice does not mean that when the word is used, the publisher is not uttering it with its defamatory meaning. It may carry the defamatory imputation even to those uncommitted to the particular moral code. 
      
     There are words which carry overtones of disapproval though the activity is perfectly legal; for example, “kept woman”: Gatley on Libel and Slander 7th ed (1974), s 187, at 93, 94. 
      
     To support fascism was probably not illegal, at least until laws prohibiting the advocacy of racial superiority were enacted, but to call a man a fascist could have been defamatory unless justifiable. Similarly with “abortionist”, it may be defamatory even of a person who only performs legal abortions. Indeed, Hunt J notes that the Macquarie Dictionary labels the word as being usually pejorative, surely of itself sufficient to require the imputation to be left to the jury for their determination as to how the word was understood by the ordinary reasonable hearer.” 
    [13] The law of defamation accommodates discrepant attitudes by use of the test “right thinking people generally”, as Glass JA points out in Hepburn at 693, and in such circumstances these are matters which should be left to the jury.Imputations (c) and (d)[14] The defendant also submits that imputations (c) and (d) are incapable of arising.[15] The matter complained of paints a picture of the plaintiff as running a highly organized operation to provide sexual services to persons including footballers, who by implication are telling her what services they require, namely underaged girls. Imputation (c) clearly is capable of arising and will go to the jury.[16] Imputation (d) is an unwieldy piece of wording, but this is because it is a direct quotation from the matter complained of. One of the difficulties, when attempting to distil imputations from statements which are inarticulate or ungrammatical, is how to produce an imputation which encapsulates what was said. [17] The entitlement of a plaintiff to use the words in the matter complained of now appears to be an accepted course: Hepburn v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [1983] 2 NSWLR 682 at 688 per Hutley JA; Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1990) 21 NSWLR 135 at 148 per Gleeson CJ; John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Blake; David Syme v Blake (2001) 53 NSWLR 541 at [52] – [54] per Hodgson JA; Mahommed v Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 213. In my view the pleader has adopted the sensible course of repeating the words without attempting to parse and analyse them.[18] Mr Dawson challenged whether the matter complained of asserts the plaintiff actually condones this behaviour. Mr Price and his guest make it clear that if she has this information, it ought to be brought to the attention of the police. Whether or not that conveys an imputation that she condones such conduct is a matter upon which reasonable minds may differ, and will be an issue for determination by the jury.[19] The defendant has been entirely unsuccessful in all of its complaints, and should pay the plaintiff’s costs.Orders(1) Dismiss the application to strike out imputations (b), (c) and (d).(2) Defendant is to pay the plaintiff’s costs.(3) Matter stood over for further directions to Friday 13 November 2009 at 9:00am.

    JUDGMENT1 Sometimes judges are faced with particularly serious offences. This is one of them. Indeed the facts in the present matter can be accurately described as “chilling”. 2 It is the primary purpose of the criminal law to protect society and its members. Unfortunately it can usually only do this after offences have been committed. But when offences as serious as this are brought to the court’s attention, it is incumbent upon the court to respond appropriately; to impose a sentence which will deter the offender, which will deter others and mark in a very concrete way the wrongfulness of the offender’s conduct.3 The events I am about to describe occurred on 29 July 2008. That evening the complainant was at home with her two children aged seven and ten. They had recently suffered some tragedy in their lives; the complainant was recently widowed. Shortly after midnight, so that it was now 30 July 2008, the complainant went to bed. She secured the premises, although for reasons which it is not necessary to describe, she was unable to do so completely. The children and the complainant went to bed and went to sleep.4 The offender was in the vicinity. He was suffering from the effects of paranoia. He decided that he would enter the premises, which he did, so by pushing open a door which would not close. He was at one stage charged with the offence of breaking and entering and committing a serious indictable offence, but the Crown dropped that charge after receiving reports from psychiatrists that suggest that the offender would have a mental illness defence to that charge because of the paranoia he was experiencing at the time. For that reason it is no part of the sentencing decision I have to make to take into account the offender’s decision to break into the home. However once there he remained there and committed two very serious offences for which he is morally responsible.5 The first thing he did was to go to the room where the complainant’s children were asleep. One of them woke up and the offender asked her where her mother and father were. The offender was thus taken to the room where the complainant was asleep. She was awoken by her daughter and she heard a male voice say “just keep quiet and you won’t get hurt”. She woke up to see the offender standing next to her daughter holding the family’s pet dog. He then heard this person whisper to her daughter “get on the bed face down. Don’t look at me”.6 He had first demanded money. The complainant gave it to him. She explained at the time that she was on a pension as she was a widow. One might have thought that anyone with an ounce of humanity might at this stage have reflected on what was going on. The offender responded simply by tying the complainant up, covering her mouth with a gag and blindfolding her. He threatened her too, saying “don’t be stupid. Don’t be a hero. You’ve got a young family. You don’t want them to get hurt.” He once again told the complainant’s daughter not to look at him.7 At this stage he left the bedroom and the complainant could hear him rummaging through items within the house. The complainant managed to free her arms and tried to call the police using her mobile phone, but as she was doing so the offender re-entered the room and became angry at what was happening. He threatened her and then retied her hands even tighter, causing pain and soreness to her wrists. (The complainant later said that her hands were going so blue that she thought they were going to fall off. ) She was finding it very hard to breathe. She asked the offender to loosen the ties which he was unable to do because they were tied so tightly. He did however obtain some scissors to cut her hands free. She remained blindfolded.8 Because she could not see what was going on, she had to interpret what was going on from other senses. She smelt something like bleach. What was happening was that the offender was spraying household cleaner with bleach in it in an attempt to cover his traces and to remove traces of his DNA that he knew he was leaving behind.9 At this point the complainant and the offender moved to the lounge room. The complainant asked the offender to leave and tried to persuade him to do so by telling him that she would not call the police. To this the offender responded that she would have to prove what she said by giving him a blow job. She asked the offender not to do it, but he responded “well if you don’t, I will then do your children.” It is hard to imagine the terror that the complainant must have felt on hearing this.10 In response to the threat, she cooperated to some extent with the offender. He pushed her onto her knees before undoing his pants and removing his penis. The complainant performed fellatio on the offender until he ejaculated into her mouth.11 At this stage the offender asked where various household items were in the house and went around collecting items. He also once again sprayed bleach to get rid of his DNA. Not surprisingly, the complainant still wished the offender to leave, but he would not do so. He made reference to “the government people” and “CIA” who were after him.12 The complainant bravely began to talk to the offender. She was no doubt very scared about what might happen. Her two daughters remained in the house and the offender had demonstrated what he was capable of. The offender required that the complainant remain with him for some hours.13 At about six o'clock in the morning, when it was becoming light, the complainant once again asked the offender to leave. It was agreed that the complainant would drive him where he wanted to go. The complainant refused to leave without her children. She was therefore required to wake her daughters and tell them that the man with her was her new boyfriend and that she had to drive him home. The four of them then got into the complainant’s car and she dropped him reasonably close to where he was then living.14 The complainant went straight away to the police station and reported what had happened to her. The offender was arrested a couple of days later. He conducted a record of interview with the police. It is significant that there is a close match of the events given by the complainant and the description of events given by the offender. The offender did tell the police that he was sorry for what he had done. There are indications also that during the course of the four hours, when the complainant engaged the offender in conversation, that he also then expressed his remorse for what he had done.15 It is difficult to imagine a more serious offence. This gross violation of the complainant occurred in her home; a place where she was entitled to feel safe. As the offender knew, she had recently suffered the loss of her husband. There were children present and indeed the offender took advantage of that by threatening them with sexual assault in order to obtain the complainant’s cooperation. The complainant is a woman who was asleep in her own home and was very vulnerable. The offender used her in a degrading way and obtained what he wanted by the use of both force and threats. Objectively, this is an offence well towards the upper range.16 The offender has now pleaded guilty to an offence of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, the circumstance of aggravation being the commission of actual bodily harm and detaining for advantage. The maximum penalty for both offences is twenty years, but the offence of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent carries with it the standard non-parole period of ten years. That of course is not of direct application, given the plea of guilty, but it remains as a guidepost to the sentence I should impose in the present matter.17 The offender has a significant custodial history. Included within it are offences of abduction and sexual assault, as well as other serious offences such as armed robbery. As Ms Hall who appears on his behalf submitted, he has spent the best part of his adult life in gaol.18 The offender’s early history is recorded in a letter that I have received written by his sister. It was relatively unremarkable. True there were the usual problems that occur when parents separate acrimoniously, but things really began to fall apart as the offender’s sister said, when he was around seventeen years of age. His criminal history is testament to what occurred thereafter.19 Those problems and offences seems to have begun as offences related to drug use. The offender first used cannabis when he was fifteen, amphetamines from seventeen and heroin at twenty-two. He has not completed any drug and alcohol counselling or rehabilitation programs and so his addiction to drugs has been longstanding.20 It is accepted apparently by the Crown that the offender suffers from a mental illness. He is at present a forensic patient due to his condition. A number of psychiatrists have seen him over the years and it is clear that the offender is mentally unwell. As I made clear, it was the offender’s paranoia, believing that he was being followed by those who would harm him, which led him to entering the complainant’s house in the first place. However it is difficult to see any connection between the offender’s mental illness and his decision to force the complainant to perform fellatio upon him. There is no reason therefore to significantly moderate the sentence I will impose upon him for that offence.21 The offender pleaded guilty at an early stage. That is consistent with his expressions of remorse which began very early in the piece. It also has utilitarian benefit to the criminal justice system. So the sentence I will impose upon the offender is twenty-five per cent less than it would otherwise have been.22 One of the matters which was the subject of submissions today concerned the effect of the fact that the offender is a forensic patient on the sentence I should impose upon him. I do not consider that that circumstance affects the length of the sentence I should impose. Firstly he may not continue to be a forensic patient and so if I were to allow that factor to influence the sentence I impose, it may well be that the basis for that is removed in the event the offender loses forensic patient status. Even if he was to remain a forensic patient for the entirety of his sentence I will shortly impose, I cannot see how that should lead to a shorter or longer sentence. I consider that the true position is that I should ignore the consequences for the offender being a forensic patient in selecting the appropriate period which he will be required to serve.23 I heard a victim impact statement read today by the complainant. It demonstrated the gravity of the consequences of criminal conduct such as that perpetrated by the offender. Those consequences were entirely foreseeable. It is not at all surprising to learn how the complainant was affected by the degrading, disgusting and humiliating experience to which she was subject.24 She is to be congratulated for presence of mind during the course of that evening. She coped with a horrible situation in a way which protected her children. One can understand how the conduct has affected her relationship with her children, as she revealed in the victim impact statement. As I said these consequences are entirely foreseeable. The offender even, mentally ill as he is, must have known that if he was going to force sexual intercourse upon the complainant with her children being in the house, she was going to suffer and significantly so.25 As Ms Hall said, it may well be that the actual bodily harm experienced by the complainant was not as bad as many cases that come before the courts. That is not enough to demonstrate that the aggravated sexual intercourse without consent offence is anything other than objectively at the high end of the range of objective seriousness for the reasons I have summarised earlier.The High Court in Veen v R (1979) 143 CLR 458 and Veen (no 2) v R (1988) 164 CLR 465 made it clear that the protection of the community is something which I am entitled to take into account. To be more specific; preventative detention is a relevant factor which I am entitled to consider. What I am not allowed to do, and what I will not do, is to allow the idea of preventative detention to lead to a sentence which is longer than would be objectively required. Within that constraint I have taken into account the likelihood that in the future offences such as this will be repeated. The offender’s criminal history and the information I have about the offender suggests that the prospects of rehabilitation are not very good. Indeed the prospect of his release to the community one day is decidedly uncomfortable.26 There are no special circumstances in this case. The period of eligibility for parole which I will shortly announce is such that if there is to be rehabilitation, I have allowed a sufficient period for it to occur.27 It is not appropriate that totally concurrent sentences are imposed. The offence of detaining for advantage focuses on a different aspect of the offender’s conduct and its effect upon the complainant when compared to the offence of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. It would be quite wrong to, in effect, give the offender one of those offences for free. There will therefore be partial accumulation.28 The offender was taken into custody on 31 July 2007. So the sentences I will now announce will commence from that date.29 For the offence of detaining for advantage I impose a sentence of imprisonment. I set a fixed term of five years to commence on 31 July 2008. That sentence is a fixed term because of the sentence I will now announce on the other matter. For the offence of aggravated sexual assault, I set a non-parole period of ten years to commence on 31 July 2010 and a head sentence of fourteen years. That means the offender will be eligible to be released to parole on 30 July 2020.

    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: Peter Lane, who gave an address at Ingleburn when he was arrested, appeals against the severity of a sentence imposed upon him by her Honour Magistrate Barry in the Penrith Court.2 Her Honour dealt with him for an act of indecency that occurred in the late afternoon of 7 December 2005 at Penrith. She imposed a sentence of fifteen months imprisonment which was backdated to 24 June 2006 when the appellant was arrested.3 The Court’s task is to evaluate, by way of rehearing, the evidence before the learned magistrate and come to its own view about the sentence that ought to be imposed; always bearing in mind that if a sentence greater than the magistrate was to be imposed that the appellant ought be warned.4 Luke T. is aged twenty. He suffers from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autistic characteristics of moderate range. He was first diagnosed as autistic at the age of two and a half. He was at the Nepean Accident and Emergency with his father. He had gone to the male toilets, had locked the door behind him, sat on the toilet seat and urinated. 5 The appellant tells his counsel that he was at the hospital, seeking treatment for something or other, and also chose to use the toilet. He appears to have been able somehow or other to unlock the cubicle that Luke T. was in. 6 Luke T. had finished the toilet and had pulled his pants up. The appellant, who clearly must have been under the influence of alcohol, walked up to the complainant, said to him that thought he was pretty and that he wanted to marry him. The appellant then kissed the complainant on the lips and touched him around his breast. The complainant pushed the appellant away, telling him that he was not allowed to do that, that the appellant was a stranger. 7 On two occasions the appellant again assaulted him in that way and the complainant repeated on each of those occasions that he was not allowed to do that as the appellant was a stranger. 8 The appellant then touched the complainant on his penis and testicles, squeezing the testicles hard, causing the complainant to cry. Yet again, the complainant said to the appellant, “Stop that.”, he was not allowed to do that and he was not allowed to touch his private parts. 9 The appellant repeated that he loved the young man and wanted to marry him. The appellant then left the toilet area and the complainant also left. Complaint was made shortly thereafter to the complainant’s father.10 When the police arrived they approached the appellant, who they felt was highly intoxicated with a long neck bottle of VB beer next to him. The appellant’s response to his situation was in these terms:   “All I want is a roof over my head and what I have to do to get locked up. How bad do I have to be?”11 The appellant tells his solicitor that basically he has lived in the last few years an itinerant lifestyle. He is fifty-six, I think it is, years old and this is his first time of full-time custody. He has, in his earlier life, been employed in various occupations but received a disability pension some years ago for some sort of degenerative cancer of the spine. 12 He himself has four children, one by a marriage more than thirty years ago now and the other three from a marriage that lasted some twenty-eight years. He has been separated from that wife for eight years now. He has lost contact with his family. 13 It would appear that he has a real problem with alcohol. There are accounts of him falling on the railway tracks, there are accounts of him being assaulted, there is history of him having prescribed concentration of alcohol offences and assault offences. It would be fair enough to infer that those assault offences are probably related to alcohol consumption. True it is, he does not have any offences of this kind.14 If one has regard to the objective criminality of this offence the starting point is to recognise that all humans are entitled to the integrity of their body. It would appear on at least three, and perhaps four, occasions this appellant persisted in face of rejection of his advances by the complainant. That adds, in my view, to his criminality. He has also targeted a person who clearly is handicapped. That is not a factor though that I feel I can take into account because it really constitutes an element of another offence with which the appellant could have been charged. But I am entitled to take into account the power imbalance between he, on the one hand, and the complainant on the other. 15 My own view is that the sentence of fifteen months, with a nine month non-parole was a sentence that made allowance for his record and for his itinerant lifestyle. 16 It is likely when he is released, unless there is some good fortune befall him so far as the Department of Housing is concerned, that he will resume the itinerant lifestyle and likely resume the alcohol consumption because it does not appear to me from anything that Mr Mulder has said that he has come to grips with his alcohol problem or the trouble that it can get him into. 17 In all the circumstances I would have, quite possibly, actually imposed a sentence slightly stronger than this. It seems her Honour has found special circumstances. It is unlikely I would have.18 In all the circumstances the appeal will be dismissed.HIS HONOUR: The formal orders are that the appeal is dismissed. The conviction confirmed. The sentence of imprisonment imposed by the Local Court confirmed. The non-parole period of nine months confirmed.

   JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: Shane William Johnson appeals against the sentence of a magistrate for an offence of driving on the road whilst he was suspended. The magistrate fined Mr Johnson and disqualified him from driving for two years. 2 This appeal has been conducted on two bases. The first is that Mr Dickins, who appears on behalf of Mr Johnson, seeks an order under Section 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. If that submission fails there is a question of statutory interpretation to be determined, that issue relating to the automatic disqualification period. I will deal with both these matters in this judgment. 3 I am not prepared to give the appellant the benefit of an order under Section 10.4 The circumstances of the offence are these: The appellant was driving after his licence had been suspended. It appears that he did not know that licence had been suspended by reason of his fine default, but when he was stopped for a number of traffic offences on 24 August by police and a licence check was done the fact that his licence was suspended was discovered. Police told Mr Johnson of this fact. They told him that he must not drive. They saw the appellant make a phone call and he told them that his mate would come and collect him. Police then left.5 Within a very short time police, however, saw the appellant driving in the same road in which they had stopped him. After stopping him again, they asked him why he drove the vehicle after being told not to and the appellant replied, “I was just moving it”. It is this act of driving which forms the basis of the offence.6 The application under Section 10 is based on the circumstance that the appellant was simply moving his car a short distance from where it was parked in a ‘No Stopping’ zone around the corner to where it would have been in a safer position. I have some difficulty in accepting that it was necessary for the appellant to drive his vehicle that distance, if even at all. There are a number of spots, visible in photographs tendered before me, where the appellant could have pulled up quite safely, that evening well before police eventually stopped him. And in any case the police made it as clear as they could have that the appellant should not drive and that doing so would be a breach of the law. In those circumstances, the appellant’s clear decision to breach the law cannot be overlooked by the imposition of an order under Section 10.7 The second matter concerns, as I have said, the interpretation of the automatic disqualification period. Section 25A of the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act provides for the disqualification period for offences of driving whilst licenses are suspended. Section 25A(7) provides that upon conviction for an offence such as that the appellant committed he is to be disqualified for “the relevant disqualification period”, on top of which he may also be disqualified for such additional period as the court may order. 8 It is the question of what the relevant disqualification period is which is to be determined. The Crown says it is two years and Mr Dickins, on behalf of the appellant, says it twelve months. Mr Dickins points to subsection 10 which says that, in this section, 
     
      
      “The relevant disqualification is:  
       
       
      (a) in the case of a first offence under subsection 1, 2 or 3A twelve months; or 
       
       
      (b) in the case of a second or subsequent offence under subsection 1, 2 or 3A two years.” 
      
    9 It is common ground that the appellant was convicted of a drink driving matter within five years of his conviction on this matter. The Crown therefore says that he has committed a second or subsequent offence after referring me to subsection 6. However, even if it is a second or subsequent offence, for the purposes of subsection 6, it is not all second of subsequent offences which are to be looked at in determining the relevant disqualification period under subsection 10. The section makes it, and I use the Crown’s term, as clear as crystal that it is only some second or subsequent offences which give rise to the extended relevant disqualification period.10 I am satisfied that the proper interpretation of Section 25A in the circumstances of this case is that the relevant disqualification period is twelve months. I am also satisfied that in the circumstances of the offence there does not need to be any additional period and so the orders I make are these.11 The appeal is allowed. I confirm the fine and court costs imposed by the magistrate, but disqualify the appellant from driving for one year.12 HIS HONOUR: Now you will have to help with the dates because, Mr Dickins, your client said that he had been driving for a period of time, didn’t he?13 DICKINS: Yes, he’s been driving from the point of time that he lodged the appeal. The time that he ceased driving was between 20 September when he was disqualified by the magistrate up until 17 October when he lodged the appeal. So it’s a period--14 HIS HONOUR: So he was off the road for a month, about a month?15 DICKINS: About a month, yes.16 HIS HONOUR: In order to take account of a period where the appellant was disqualified from driving before the sentence was stayed, I will date the disqualification period one month prior to today’s date. So the disqualification period of one year is to date from 12 February 2008.

    JUDGMENTAny matter which identifies the complainant is not be published.1 HIS HONOUR: This is an application which arises because of the provisions of s 306I of the Criminal Procedure Act. 2 The accused, Mr Qin, was arraigned and on trial for two days in October this year before Judge Berman and a jury. The complainant gave evidence-in-chief and the barrister who then appeared for Mr Qin did cross-examine her. 3 The cross-examination commenced after the luncheon adjournment. The complainant's evidence appeared to take about an hour and a half, and then the barrister, after getting some instructions, proceeded to cross-examine her and put to her a number of matters, consistent with the defence by the accused, that none of the things that she alleged had happened. 4 The matter was adjourned overnight, and when the proceedings resumed the following morning, the barrister indicated to the Court that there were some problems. It appeared that he and the solicitor, who then represented Mr Qin, had given some advice or made some comments to Mr Qin which, among other things, caused him to lose confidence in them. As his Honour noted, when he asked Mr Qin about these matters, there was nothing he thought was improper about the advice that the barrister had given to him, but what concerns me, on this occasion, is that certain matters apparently were not put to the complainant by the then representatives of Mr Qin, and it is on that basis that Mr Murray, who now represents Mr Qin, makes this application. 5 Under s 306I, the complainant, in a case such as this, is not required to give evidence, because an audio visual recording of her evidence that we have can be played, and she is not compelled to give further evidence. 6 Section 306J provides:  
     
      
      (1) If a record of the original evidence of the complainant (or any part of the record) is admitted in proceedings under this Division, the complainant is not compellable to give further evidence in the proceedings unless the court is satisfied that it is necessary for the complainant to give further evidence:  
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (a) to clarify any matters relating to the original evidence of the complainant, or 
         
        (b) to canvas information or material that has become available since the original proceedings, or 
         
        (c) in the interests of justice.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
      (2) Subsection (1) applies despite anything to the contrary in this Act or the Evidence Act 1995.  
      
     
     
      
      (3) The court is to ensure that the complainant is questioned by any party to the proceedings only in relation to matters that are relevant to the matters mentioned in subsection (1).  
       
      
     
     
      
      (4) Subject to subsection (3), if a complainant gives any further oral evidence under this section, the complainant is compellable (for the prosecution or the accused person) to give evidence.  
      
    7 This is a case where Mr Murray's application is made and it is in the interests of justice that he be permitted to cross-examine the complainant as to those matters about which he is instructed and which, on the transcript of the previous proceedings, counsel who represented Mr Qin in those proceedings, did not put to the complainant. 8 This is, as I indicated in the course of argument, a very sensitive area. The presumptions created by Sections 306I and 306J of the Criminal Procedure Act are in favour of a complainant not being called to give evidence at all, in a subsequent trial where his or her evidence in the first trial is complete. 9 However, in this case, the situation is unusual, in that the reason for the trial being discontinued was the decision by Judge Berman, that he could not continue the trial, without Mr Qin having the opportunity to be legally represented, and in circumstances where Mr Qin withdrew the instructions of the solicitor and barrister then representing him. The reasons for the withdrawal of those instructions are relevant in these proceedings. 10 Normally, in an application of this sort, I would expect the application for the exercise of the Court's discretion, in this case under s 306J(1)(c), to be made, either by affidavit or to be supported by oral evidence. However, if this arises in the circumstances of a criminal trial, to require the accused person to give evidence and subject himself to cross-examination on that evidence, would destroy certain rights, which are fairly central in our system of criminal justice. 11 Because there is no obligation on an accused person to prove his innocence or, indeed, to prove anything, in order for him to be found not guilty, it has traditionally been the right of an accused person to remain silent. An accused person always has the right to give evidence in his or her defence, but whether or not he or she exercises that right, is a question which arises, ultimately, only when the Crown case is complete. To force an accused person to give evidence, which would give the Crown a significant or, indeed, any forensic advantage, before that point, is something which would be unfortunate. 12 For that reason, I allowed Mr Murray to state, from the Bar table, certain of the instructions he had, which required further cross-examination of the complainant. He outlined two areas. One was the way in which the accused says that the practice of Chinese massage normally operates, particularly in relation to the legs, and Mr Murray's instructions are that the way that the accused person, who is by profession a masseur, would have massaged a client's legs is inconsistent with the complainant's evidence, and in order to test that evidence completely, certain matters would have to be put to her, consistent with the rules in Browne v Dunn and other evidentiary rules. 13 The second matter, which Mr Murray raised, was that on the accused's case, a friend or flatmate, or possibly both, of the complainant, subsequently went back to the accused's premises and demanded a refund of money, threatening certain things to the accused, if that money was not refunded. The complainant may or may not know about those things. She could only be asked to give evidence about matters of which she was aware, or which she had, in fact, seen or heard, but even so, it would be relevant to the accused's defence, to put those matters to her. 14 After considering all those matters, I do consider that it is in the interests of justice that the complainant be required to be subjected to further cross-examination in respect of those matters, but not in respect of any matters in respect of which she has already been cross-examined.

   JUDGMENT1 Jan Edmiston was doing her Christmas shopping in the Target store in Charlestown on 19 December 1995 when a number of boxes fell on her. The plaintiff described the boxes as being of considerable bulk and weight. After the incident a shop assistant drew her attention to the bent condition of the brackets on which the shelf rested and told her that the boxes contained room dividers. The plaintiff was not challenged on this evidence. 2 The plaintiff claimed that the defendant was responsible for the care and control of the premises upon which the Target store operated and that it was negligent in the way in which it allowed the staff at the store to stack the shelf from which the boxes fell. The defendant did not concede the issue of negligence, but called no evidence and put forward no submissions. It made no admissions on the pleadings.3 It was more than apparent that care must be taken when the shelves of a major department store are stacked and that a foreseeable risk to patrons could reasonably be anticipated if the required level of care was not taken. In this case the only evidence available indicated that the shelf in question was overloaded to the point where its supporting brackets buckled under the weight of the goods contained in the boxes that fell on the plaintiff. There was therefore clear evidence of breach by the defendant of its duty of care to the plaintiff. I therefore make the following formal findings on liability. 
     
      
      1 The defendant had care and control of the premises on which the Target store operated. 
      
     
     
      
      2 The defendant failed to exercise an appropriate level of care in the stacking of the shelf from which the boxes fell onto the plaintiff. 
      
     
     
      
      3 This failure represented a breach of the defendant’s duty of care to the plaintiff. 
      
    4 The issue of the plaintiff’s damages was more complex. 5 The plaintiff stated that the boxes fell and struck the right side of her head and her right shoulder and knocked her glasses from her face causing her to fall to the ground. She said she saw stars. She was assisted by other patrons and store staff who removed the boxes and provided her with a chair. At the time she was feeling pain in her shoulder, neck and temple. She declined an offer to call an ambulance and commenced to drive home. She vomited twice in the course of driving home and decided instead to go immediately to her general practitioner, Dr Kesby. Treatment provided by Dr Kesby involved x-ray investigation and physiotherapy which was of limited relief. She was also provided with pain-killing medication. 6 The plaintiff complained of ongoing constant pain and a deteriorating condition that considerably limited her social, domestic and economic activities. At the time of the accident she was 64 years old. She is now 67. In October 2005 she retired from her position as a sales supervisor with David Jones. She was at that stage single following a divorce. She had three adult children. One daughter lived one street away in Woodberry, a Newcastle suburb. 7 The issues to be addressed in assessing damages were: 
     
      
      1 The extent to which this injury caused or contributed to the plaintiff’s current physical condition having regard to; 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (a) the history of previous injury to her cervical spine, 
         
        (b) the history of injury to her right knee, and 
         
        (c) the plaintiff’s use of Panadeine Forte before and after the incident. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      2 The effect of these factors on the assessment of her damages for non-economic loss, future income earning capacity, requirements for domestic care and medical expenses past and future. 
      
    ISSUE 1 – EXTENT OF INJURYThe cervical spine8 Radiological investigation indicated that the plaintiff suffered from degenerative disease in her neck that pre-existed the incident of 19 December 2005. Degenerative changes were described in the MRI scan as moderate to severe. The defendant contended that these changes were the result of injuries suffered by the plaintiff in motor vehicle accidents in which she was involved in January 1992, March 1997 and in 2002 and that after the incident of December 2005 the plaintiff suffered short term aggravation of the condition resulting from these injuries.9 Medical reports of Dr A V B Isaacs dated between 1992 and 1994 following the first accident referred to ongoing complaints of neck and back pain. Those reports indicated that the plaintiff consulted Dr Isaacs twice in 1992 and once in 1994 for medico-legal purposes and not consistently over that period for treatment as suggested by the defendant. It was apparent, however, from the reports that in 1994 the plaintiff continued to suffer from symptoms in her neck and low back. Dr Isaacs expressed the opinion that the plaintiff suffered soft tissue injuries, in the case of the cervical spine, without nerve root irritation. No other medical reports in relation to this injury were tendered by the defendant and I was therefore unaware of any opposing medical view to that of Dr Isaacs. 10 The only evidence in respect of the 1997 motor vehicle accident was one clinical note of her general practitioner at the time, Dr Balaz, of a complaint of a sore neck and headache. The only evidence in respect of the 2002 motor vehicle accident was one clinical note of her general practitioner at the time, Dr Balaz, recording whiplash to the neck.11 It was in my view unsurprising that at the age of 64 the plaintiff’s cervical spine showed signs of degeneration. Further, based on her age and medical history, it can readily be accepted that the incident in December 2005 aggravated the already damaged condition of her cervical spine. The history indicated, however, that the plaintiff suffered only from very intermittent symptoms in her neck in contrast to the ongoing serious pain and discomfort of which she complained following the incident.12 The defendant’s contention was based upon a report of Dr Burke who examined the plaintiff in October 2007. He related the plaintiff’s current symptoms to the pre-existing condition. His opinion was that the aggravation resulting from the incident affected the plaintiff for, at most, a few months after the accident. His opinion appeared to be based upon two factors. The first was his diagnosis of apparent multi-level degenerative cervical spondylitis. This diagnosis was based on a report of Dr Kesby, the plaintiff’s current general practitioner, dated 12 February 2007 in which she reported that an x-ray of December 2005  
     
      
      showed multiple areas of degenerative changes - there was mild kyphosis, segmental degenerative disc disease, degenerative changes in the intervertebral processes, some narrowing of the intervertebral foramina with degenerative facet joint disease. 
      
    13 This description was inconsistent with an opinion expressed by Dr Bookallil, a specialist in neurosurgery, in June 2007 based upon a CT scan indicating that there was minor degenerative disease in the plaintiff’s neck. The subsequent MRI scan suggested a greater degree of degeneration, but according to Dr Bookallil there was still no evidence of nerve pressure. Dr Burke made no reference to the CT or the MRI scans. I do not know, therefore, if he was supplied with copies of them.14 The plaintiff stated that she was examined by Dr Bodel on behalf of the defendant on the same day as she was examined by Dr Burke. No report was tendered by the defendant from Dr Bodel. I infer that his opinion would not have assisted the defendant in deciding between the differing opinions of Dr Burke and Dr Bookallil.15 The second aspect of Dr Burke’s opinion related to what he reported as inconsistencies that he observed in the course of his examination of the plaintiff. He said that some of the plaintiff’s symptoms could not be explained in rational anatomic terms, there were no corroborating physical signs, her movements varied between formal and informal examination and she made jerky movements that would have been avoided if symptoms were present.16 Notwithstanding these comments and his diagnosis, Dr Burke stated that any symptoms of strain or aggravation caused by the accident would have resolved shortly after the accident and her current symptoms are due to underlying age related degenerative spondylitis and arthritis. Dr Burke therefore did not reject entirely the plaintiff’s complaints of symptoms.17 Dr Bookallil accepted that the symptoms from which the plaintiff continued to complain were the result of the exacerbation of the pre-existing condition of her neck by the injury suffered in this incident.The plaintiff’s knees18 The plaintiff injured her right knee in a work related incident that occurred in March 2004. She was treated by Dr Laird with arthroscopy that confirmed that she suffered a tear in the medial meniscus and disclosed other age related changes. Her recovery from this procedure was complicated by the development of a deep vein thrombosis. Medical evidence indicated that the plaintiff continued to suffer symptoms in the right knee and that she later developed symptoms in her left knee for the treatment of which Dr Laird recommended a further arthroscopy. 19 The plaintiff denied that these symptoms significantly affected her activities. Specifically, she denied that the condition of her knees was the reason for her retirement in October 2005. She said that by this stage her right knee gave her occasional twinges, more if she was active. She said she was living fully independently, she had returned to ballroom dancing and to gardening with the assistance of her son who raised her garden beds so that she was no longer required to kneel.20 Medical evidence suggested that the plaintiff was not entirely frank with the court on this aspect of her claim. Dr Sage reported in September 2005 a prognosis for increasing degenerative changes in the right knee and he considered an arthroscopy of the left knee would be appropriate. He noted specifically that the plaintiff wanted to continue working. He said it was reasonable that she continue as she then was on reduced hours, being five hours a day for three days a week. He noted that the plaintiff told him that she had given up dancing.21 Dr Ghabrial in November 2005, shortly prior to the incident at the Target store, reported that the plaintiff had to give up work a week before because of pain and weakness in her right leg and the development of symptoms in her left knee. After examining the plaintiff he reported pain, weakness and some limitation of movement as well as developing osteoarthritis in the right knee. He also recommended further investigation of the condition of the left knee. In June 2006, seven months after the incident, Dr Ghabrial’s findings in respect of the right knee were unchanged and he reported a marked deterioration in the condition of the plaintiff’s left knee. 22 In July 2006 Dr Hollo reported that she had been informed by the plaintiff that the left knee was progressively worse since October 2005 and that the progressive nature of the left knee symptoms was a reason why she retired from work.23 Dr Pillemer examined the plaintiff in August 2006 on behalf of the Workers Compensation Commission in respect of her right knee injury. It appeared that he was not informed of the plaintiff’s problems with her neck and shoulders. Rather, he recorded that the plaintiff told him that her general health, aside from the condition of her knees, was good. He reported that the plaintiff told him that there was no improvement in the right knee from the time of her original injury, that she had daily swelling and pain in the knee, that it caused her problems sleeping, that symptoms were aggravated by excessive standing or walking, she had difficulty ascending or descending stairs, which she avoided, she was unable to crouch or kneel and she had not been able to dance since the time of the injury. Dr Pillemer reported that the plaintiff did her housework with many rests and that she went shopping with her daughter and completed her shopping only with many rests.24 Ms Bell, the occupational therapist, on the other hand, in February 2008 was informed that the plaintiff’s right knee recovered well and that it did not limit the plaintiff functionally. The plaintiff told Ms Bell that she had occasional aching in the right knee and slight aching in the left knee on rare occasions.Medication25 The plaintiff said that prior to the incident at the Target store she used analgesia to manage the pain in her knees, nominating Panadol, Panamax and some Celebrex. Since the incident she said she had resorted to Panadeine Forte, a much stronger pain killer, of which she took four to eight tablets a day. Dr Burke expressed concern at the extent to which she was relying on Panadeine Forte for pain relief. He suggested that she was addicted to this medication and that her condition would improve if she were weaned off the medication. 26 The plaintiff emphatically denied any addiction. The evidence, however, indicated that the plaintiff was not honest in stating that her regular use of Panadeine Forte commenced only after the Target incident. The clinical notes of Dr Balaz, the former general practitioner, record prescriptions issued on 12 September 2005 and 5 December 2005, a matter of weeks prior to the incident. The plaintiff appeared to consult both Dr Balaz and Dr Kesby as general practitioners in 2006 and for a period she obtained prescriptions for Panadeine Forte from both of these doctors. Dr Kesby continued to provide prescriptions on a regular basis. Her clinical notes indicated a dose of two at night to assist the plaintiff to sleep and the quantities prescribed were consistent with this regime. 27 It appeared, therefore, that the plaintiff was dishonest with the court in regard to medication in two respects, namely, on the question of whether she required pain killing medication of this strength prior to the incident and also the extent to which she was consuming Panadeine Forte since the incident.28 My findings on the first issue are as follows: 
     
      
      1 The plaintiff was not completely frank with the court in certain aspects of her evidence. 
      
     
     
      
      2 This absence of frankness meant that I could not accept her evidence at face value. 
      
     
     
      
      3 While Dr Burke identified areas of inconsistency, he did not reject entirely the plaintiff’s complaints of symptoms related to the condition of her cervical spine. 
      
     
     
      
      4 Dr Bookallil accepted that those symptoms were the result of the injury suffered in this incident. 
      
     
     
      
      5 The defendant’s contention that the plaintiff’s condition was the inevitable result of degeneration in her cervical spine was not supported by the medical evidence. Clinical notes of Dr Balaz after 1994 made insignificant reference to neck or shoulder pain notwithstanding the incidents of 1997 and 2002. Dr Kesby, who treated the plaintiff after the incident, recorded in her report of February 2007 and in her subsequent clinical notes complaints of persistent, chronic neck pain with headaches. 
      
     
     
      
      6 In the light of this material I find that the plaintiff, as a result of the incident of 19 December 2005, suffered exacerbation of the degenerative condition of her cervical spine resulting in persistent, chronic symptoms that had not been present prior to the incident. 
      
     
     
      
      7 I also find that there was an element of exaggeration in the plaintiff’s presentation and in her claimed need for pain-killing medication. 
      
    ISSUE 2 - ASSESSMENT Non-economic Loss29 The plaintiff claimed that prior to the accident she was independent and active and that she was looking forward to pursuing a number of activities in her retirement that included travel, gardening, furniture restoration and dancing. She claimed that she could no longer undertake any of these tasks. She claimed that her capacity to drive was limited to short journeys only because of the limitation of the range of movement in her neck. The evidence concerning her gardening was consistent, namely, that prior to the incident she managed to continue to pursue this hobby with raised garden beds. 30 There were significant inconsistencies between the plaintiff’s evidence and the medical reports concerning the extent to which the condition of her knees affected her day to day activities. On the basis of the medical evidence I do not accept that she resumed dancing prior to the incident and I find that her other activities were almost certainly already curtailed by the condition of her knees. Taking this factor into account and taking into account the plaintiff’s age as required by the decision of Reece v Reece (1994) 19 MVR 103 I have assessed her non-economic loss at 25 per cent of a worst case and have awarded her the sum of $28,500.Income Loss31 I have already noted that at the time of her retirement the plaintiff was working 25 hours a week being 5 hours over 5 days. The plaintiff said she intended, because of financial necessity, to supplement her pension through casual work which she knew would be available at David Jones. The evidence was that she could earn up to $60 a week without affecting her pension rights. Although I do not accept the plaintiff’s statement that the condition of her knees did not influence her decision to retire, it was apparent from the medical evidence that casual work of this limited nature was within her capacity for a short period after retirement. I find that this limited income earning capacity could no longer be exercised because of the combined consequences of the condition of her knees and her cervical spine. I therefore allow the amount claimed by the plaintiff for income loss in the sum of $15,000.Domestic Care32 Section 15(2) of the Civil Liability Act 2002 provides that damages may be awarded for gratuitous attendant care services only if the need arose solely because of the injury to which the damages relate. Notwithstanding the plaintiff’s denials, the evidence established that she was limited in her capacity to undertake the heavier aspects of her housework, interior and exterior, and in her garden by her age and by the progressively deteriorating condition of her knees. I accept that the injury in this incident caused symptoms that imposed further limitations. Notwithstanding the evidence of the plaintiff’s daughter, I do not accept that those limitations extended to the need for gratuitous care for six hours a week for six months after December 2005. I have therefore made no allowance for past gratuitous care. 33 The defendant argued that I should make no allowance for future paid care in the absence of medical evidence to support the findings contained in the report of Ms Bell, the occupational therapist. 34 I see no reason not to accept the opinions of a qualified expert in occupational therapy. It is clear that the plaintiff will not be in a position to rely permanently upon her daughter to continue to provide services on a gratuitous basis. It is therefore reasonable that she be compensated for the commercial cost of providing for the needs arising from the injury suffered in this incident. I have allowed one half of the amount claimed. The reduction by one half has been made to take account of the needs generated by the progressive condition of the plaintiff’s knees and of the needs that will inevitably be required as the plaintiff advances in age. I have allowed on this head the sum of $37,092.Out-of-pocket Expenses35 Past out-of-pocket expenses have been agreed in the sum of $2,136. A claim is made for future medication and physiotherapy. The defendant argued that physiotherapy should not be allowed because it had not previously assisted the plaintiff. The proposition disregarded the evidence in Dr Kesby’s report that the plaintiff’s condition deteriorated when physiotherapy ceased because it was no longer funded. I have, however, reduced the amount claimed because I do not accept that the plaintiff’s requirement for Panadeine Forte was as great as stated. I have allowed the sum of $4,000 for future medical expenses.36 In summary, the amounts allowed are as follows:  
     
      
      Non-economic loss $28,500. 
       
      Future income $15,000 loss. 
       
      Past care nil.  
       
      Future care $37,092. 
       
      Past out-of-pocket expenses $2136.  
       
      Future out-of-pocket expenses $4000.  
      
    37 The total of these sums is $86,728. 38 The orders which I make are as follows.  
     
      
      1 Verdict and judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $86,728.  
      
     
     
      
      2 The defendant is to pay the plaintiff’s costs of the proceedings.  
      
     
     
      
      3 The exhibits may be returned.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Hung Phuc Ly appears for sentence today having pleaded at an early opportunity to one offence of cultivating a large commercial quantity of cannabis by enhanced indoor means. When I sentenced him for that matter he asks that I take into account on a Form 1 an offence of knowingly taking part in the supply of cannabis leaf relating to twenty-eight kilograms of cannabis leaf. These offences came to light after police became aware of the activities of this offender and a number of others relating to premises in Wolseley Street, Bexley. Telephone intercepts and surveillance were undertaken. They revealed that others involved were Cai Xiong Li, Xionglu Li and Hung Tien Ly as well as this offender. Further observations revealed that Guanglong Nong was also involved. 2 Observations by police enabled them to see Cai Xiong Li placing items into a rubbish bin. That rubbish bin was taken back to the police station. It was found to contain 2.8 kilograms of cannabis leaf and a pair of white latex gloves. No one has been charged concerning that quantity of cannabis leaf.3 The cultivation continued after that date. It appears that it was intended that the plants would be harvested on 25 February 2009. To that end Cai Xiong Li made a number of telephone calls to organise a meeting on 24 February 2009. The following day Cai Xiong Li, this offender, Hung Tien Ly and Xionglu Li all attended at the Wolseley Street premises for the purposes of harvesting the cannabis plants. It is to be noted - and the importance of this will become apparent later - that Guanglong Nong did not attend to assist in the harvesting.4 The police then entered the premises and arrested the offenders. They saw that the enhanced indoor cultivation of cannabis plants had been well established. As is usually the case, the mains electricity had been bypassed and there were many items involved in cultivation found, such as lampshades, fans, power transformers, in three areas of the house and in an under floor room. Two hundred and twenty-seven cannabis plants were taken from the house. Ninety of those were in two propagating trays and were immature seedlings. The remaining 137 plants were being harvested and they yielded twenty-eight kilograms of wet cannabis leaf (this is the matter on the Form 1).5 It is clear from the facts tendered before me and confirmed by the Crown that there was a hierarchy of offending. At the top of the tree was Cai Xiong Li. It was he who rented the premises and organised the others to work for him. At the bottom of the tree was Guanglong Nong and in the middle, Mr Crown concedes slightly above Guanglong Nong, was this offender. Mr Crown asked that I sentence him on the basis that he was a labourer. Not surprisingly, Mr Gillette who appears for the offender does not quarrel with that description of his client’s conduct.6 Somewhat remarkably, the offender is fifty-four years of age and has no prior criminal history. He was born in Vietnam and came to Australia in 1985 as a refugee. Once in Australia he married and had two children; they are now aged nineteen and twenty-three. Although the marriage has not been without its difficulties, it is the intention of the offender to resume living with his wife upon his release from custody. Mr Ly studied in school to the equivalent of year 10 whilst in Vietnam, but once arriving in Australia it does not seem that he undertook any further education, and both his work and further education have been limited by his limited ability to read, write or speak English. Notwithstanding this, according to the pre-sentence report, he has had a stable history of employment. He worked as a welder for about ten years and then as a car detailer. He was employed until he was charged for the current offences. There is no suggestion that the offender was himself a user of drugs, and it seems that the offender has become involved in this offence as a labourer because of the financial rewards that it would bring him.7 The offence carries with it a standard non-parole period of ten years. The Crown says that there would be reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period, they being that there was a plea of guilty, that the quantity of plants involved was only slightly over the number which would take it into the large commercial quantity, and the offender’s age and prior good character would suggest he has good prospects of rehabilitation. I will accept what the Crown says and depart in a significant way from the standard non-parole period. Nevertheless, it remains as an important guidepost indicating the seriousness with which offences of this kind should have been dealt.8 I earlier sentenced Mr Nong. At the time I commented that from the information available to me regarding other sentences imposed upon those convicted of cultivating a large commercial quantity of cannabis by enhanced indoor means do not appear to have reflected the seriousness with which the legislature says such offences should be treated. The sentencing statistics and cases which I was provided with today have only confirmed that view. Nevertheless, it is not for me to make an example of this offender in order to correct what I believe is an inappropriate leniency being offered to people who have committed this offence. Given the standard non-parole period of ten years, it is remarkable that the sentencing statistics would suggest that the longest head sentence imposed for an offence of this kind is only seventy per cent of the standard non-parole period.9 I should also mention principles of parity and a particular difficulty that arises in sentencing the offender. As well as Mr Nong, one of the other men involved in this operation has been sentenced. Cai Xiong Li, who both Mr Crown and Mr Gillette regard as the principal, (as do I), was sentenced by his Honour Judge Norrish on 24 September 2010. He was sentenced for not only the offence of cultivating a large commercial quantity of cannabis plants by indoor means, but also an offence of supply. The effective non-parole period imposed by his Honour was three years. When I sentenced Mr Nong, I specifically said that one of the most important reasons that I was imposing the sentence on Mr Nong that I did was because, if I did not, he would have a justifiable sense of grievance when he compared his sentence with that imposed on Mr Ly by Judge Norrish.10 At the time I sentenced Mr Nong, a decision had not been made by the prosecution as to whether there would be a Crown appeal against the sentence imposed by Judge Norrish, but Mr Laird today told me that there was to be such an appeal. I will say quite clearly that I am only imposing a sentence upon this offender which is as lenient as it is because of the principles of parity. If, as it turns out, the sentence imposed by Judge Norrish is found to be wrong by the Court of Criminal Appeal, then one of the most significant factors affecting the sentence that I am going to impose on this offender will disappear. It is unfortunately that if there is an error in the case of the sentence involving Mr Li, it has flowed through to the sentences I have imposed on Mr Nong and this offender.11 Despite everything I have said I want to emphasise that it is a very important matter that the principles of parity are applied. As I mentioned when sentencing Mr Nong, no-one should think that the length of a sentence to be imposed is significantly affected by the identity of the judicial officer imposing it. I accept that the offender has a very large bank of good character on which he is entitled to rely. As I said before, it is remarkable that his first offence would be one of such seriousness, committed after a lifetime of law-abiding behaviour. 12 I accept that the offender is remorseful for what he has done, and with the support of his family, does have good prospects of rehabilitation.13 Notwithstanding that, it has to be recognised that the offender’s misconduct was serious, and that he needs to be significantly punished for what he has done. 14 I will discount the sentence I would otherwise have imposed upon him by twenty-five per cent to reflect his early guilty plea, and particularly the utilitarian benefit that that gives to the criminal justice system.15 The sentence I impose upon the offender is this, taking into account the Form 1 matter: the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of two years and two months to have commenced on 25 February 2009. It will expire on 24 April 2011 which is the earliest day on which the offender can be released to parole. I set an overall sentence of four years and four months. As will be obvious, I have found special circumstances in this case: it is the offender’s first time in custody.

    JUDGMENT1. On 3 July 2007 John George, a resident of Brewarrina, locked and secured his home at 16 Tarrion Street, Brewarrina before heading off to Lismore. Mr George left the house under the periodic supervision of a friend.  2. About 10.30 on Thursday, 5 July a young person RB smashed the kitchen window of 16 Tarrion Street. Some time later this offender entered the premises through the kitchen window, forced the rear door open allowing for entry of the young person RB and another young person, the brother of him, CB plus a co-offender David Nicholls into the house. All went into the kitchen area. After a short time the co-offender Nicholls left with the yellow Leisure brand esky. He left the premises with CB. At the time Nicholls left, the offender and RB remained in the house searching for items of value. 3. The offender and RB completely ransacked the premises, scattering items throughout the kitchen, lounge room and master bedroom whilst searching for items of value. The offender and RB took a number of items from various locations from within the house. The most significant of these being a heavy grey coloured CMI wall safe located in the master bedroom. The two carried the safe out of the house and took it to the backyard. 4. On 18 June 2008 Cecil McHughes began the process of being held accountable for his criminal conduct of nearly a year earlier by pleading guilty before Judge Norrish to a charge that he on or about 1 July at Brewarrina in the State of New South Wales in circumstances of aggravation did break and enter the dwelling house of John George and in the dwelling house did commit a serious indictable offence, namely steal a quantity of Australian and foreign currency, a number of military service medals, commemorative coins, personal property, a safe, a motorcycle and an angle grinder, all the property of the said Mr George. 5. As sentencing judge it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentence for this offence before this court committed by this offender harming this victim, that is, Mr George, in the community of Brewarrina; Gladue v The Queen [1999] 1SCR 688 [80]. My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offences before the Court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to him, that is, the subjective matters. The starting point for such assessments requires a sentencing judge to make findings of fact from the evidence before the Court relating to both the offence and to the offender. My fact finding task has been circumscribed in that the parties have tendered an agreed set of facts. It will be sufficient at this point that I remind the Court that a judge is not a party to the agreed set of facts. The tender of the agreed set of facts does not relieve the judge from his or her fact finding responsibility, it simply limits the material from which those facts may be found. To the extent, if it be the case, that the facts as agreed do not reflect the actual events that occurred, it must be remembered the Court can only find facts on the evidence placed before it. 6. The offender’s rehabilitation prospects, particularly given his age, will have to be assessed even if looking through a glass darkly. 7. Before any sentence can be made there are likely to be other questions such as deterrence, discounts, whether special circumstances are to be found and the like. One particular feature in respect of this offence is whether a standard non-parole period is to be attracted and, if so, its length. Finally, of course, if a term of imprisonment is to be imposed that needs to be determined as well. In this case also, particularly bearing in mind the rehabilitation, whether there is any process that can be undertaken to advance that rehabilitation. What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against the imperative that all sentencing should have as its primary focus the protection of the community will also need to be determined; see R v Cuthbert (1967) 2 NSWR 329, R v Rushby [1977] NSWLR 597 and R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740.Further Facts8. The offender and RB having taken the safe from the house made their way to a shed at the rear of the premises. RB forced entry into the shed and the two entered. From the shed a 1993 Suzuki TF185 motorbike and a blue Makita brand angle grinder were stolen as was a wheelbarrow located against the northern fence area. The safe and angle grinder were placed in the wheelbarrow and moved a distance from the house. The offender then left the premises, went and arranged for a utility motor vehicle to come. The offender and RB put the safe on the utility and the motorbike was towed away, that is the motorbike with the co-offender on it was towed away.9. During the morning of Friday, 6 July 2007 this offender and RB forced entry into the safe at 9 Culgoa Street, Brewarrina, which was his, that is RB’s residence. They used the angle grinder. The safe contained a large pre-decimal coin collection, including a rare 1930 penny and a 1921 square kookaburra penny, a large assortment of other valuable,. rare and antique coins, an Australian pre-decimal paper banknote collection, various war service medals standing in the name of M J Hegarty, who was, as I understand it, Mr George’s father, and other commemorative coins. The value of the coin collection was subsequently assessed as being $116,775. The majority of the collection was in “very fine” or “mint” condition. 10. On 12 July police recovered a number of coins and documents relating to the coin collection. They were identified by Mr George and returned to him. On the same day Mr George located his wheelbarrow at a vacant house block nearby. 11. On Friday the 13th a search warrant was executed at 10 Barwon Street, Brewarrina, where police located a single silver coin. Mr George later identified that coin as belonging to him.12. On Tuesday, 17 July Lynn Crowley, owner/manager of the Cash and Carry Store, Bathurst Street, returned a number of assorted Australian currency coins to George. She had accumulated the coins via means of transactions at her store. Ms Crowley indicated that she identified the coins by conducting afternoon checks of the till and did not know who had supplied these specific coins. Mr George identified these coins as belonging to his collection.13. On Thursday, 26 July 2007 police conducted a search warrant again of 9 Culgoa Street, Brewarrina, where they located various documents relating to the coin collection, numerous pieces of plastic casing from the missing Australian currency, a casing being part of the material needed to keep the coins in mint condition, the missing yellow Leisure brand esky and a missing Kodak camera within the shed, a green coin album containing a collection consisting mainly of pennies, including the valuable 1930 penny underneath a box behind one of the sheds, a lug ground off from the safe door and a metal handle, which clearly must have been the door handle for the safe on the ground near the sheds and the missing Suzuki bike. All of the items were seized by police and a large portion of the rare coin collection is still outstanding. Significantly and sadly the war service medals have not been found or returned. The safe is believed to have been discarded in the Barwon River. It has not been recovered, although its door has been.Objective Criminality14. From the facts as he finds them to be, the sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offence as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of this offender. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in this case with criminality of offences of a similar kind. It is in that way that the objective criminality of this offence is evaluated. The objective criminality, not surprisingly, has a very important impact upon the overall sentencing outcome.15. The criminal justice system places great store upon the sanctity of a person’s home. For example, in the normal course of events police or government authorities must seek the Court’s permission before they enter even the most humble person’s home without that person’s permission. Before they are given permission, the Court must be satisfied that their purpose in entering the home is a lawful or legal purpose. To enter anyone’s home without permission of the owner is antisocial and therefore criminal. To enter that home for an illegal purpose, in this case to steal, is even more antisocial; the level of criminality becomes greater. Where several persons join together to unlawfully enter the home for an illegal task of ransacking the home and stealing things, the level of criminality becomes greater still. To illustrate this point, the law increases the maximum penalty so that while the offence of stealing carries a maximum penalty of five years gaol, where there is a breaking and entering accompanying the stealing, the maximum penalty becomes fourteen, and when the breaking and the entering and the stealing is done in the company of others, the maximum penalty becomes one of twenty years, or five (sic) times what it would be if something was simply stolen.16. In R v David Nicholls [2008] NSWDC 123, a case of one of the co-offenders that I sentenced on 3 April 2008, I observed in the well known English case of Brewster [1998] 1 CrAp.R 220 at 225, the presiding judge made these observations, “Domestic burglary is and has always been regarded as a very serious offence.” This is an offence of burglary in company, just so that Mr McHughes can understand what I am saying: 
     
      
      “Burglary may involve considerable loss to a victim. The loss of material possessions is only part and often a minor part of the reason why domestic burglary is a serious offence. Most people perfectly and legitimately attach importance to the privacy and security of their homes. Should an intruder break and enter for this dishonest purpose that leaves the victim with a sense of violation and insecurity. Even where a victim is unaware at the time that the burglar is in the house, that can present as a frightening experience to learn that a burglary has taken place.” 
       
      
    The same case made the point that a victim may lose possessions of particular value to him. A coin collection, and particularly the collection of medals of family heroes, would, of course, be matters of great importance and great historical importance to a victim. 17. When sentencing David Nicholls for his role in this offence, I made some further observations which are also of some relevance to this offender’s criminality.  
     
      
      41: The value of the goods taken may well have amounted to something in the order of $125,000. The coin and paper collection, as I said, was valued at $116,000. While it is unlikely that burglars had any idea of the value of the items taken, indeed the owner valued his collection at only $40,000, nonetheless a measure of criminality is the real value of items taken. Money value is one measure of the real value, but to the owner sentimental, aesthetic and historical value are also of importance.  
      
      
     
      
      42: The loss off war medals belonging presumably to his father and grandfather may well represent a greater loss than their money’s worth. The high value of the goods taken consequently amounts to an aggravating feature. Fortunately much of the permanency of that criminal damage has been mitigated by the police discovery of many of the stolen items, including two of the most valuable. 
      
     
     
      
      43: A feature of this case is the burglars’ crass lack of appreciation of the aesthetic, historical and emotional significance of a collection of this quality together with the war medals. Such is the reverence that numismatists would have for items in this collection that they would have worn special gloves to handle them. For these offenders what they could not spend was strewn about the yard and shed with total disregard to their collective quality. While I have made this observation, I have not added this ignorance to the criminality I am dealing with. 
       
       
      
    18. Other aspects of the criminality involved in this offence include the damage done to Mr George’s home. A window was broken and it would seem the lock on the back door was forced. The premises were ransacked. 19. The offender’s role, as set out in the agreed facts, was a major role. It was he who first entered the premises, opened the door for the others to enter, participated in the extensive search of the premises, removed the safe and its contents from the premises, and with RB forced entry to the shed and stole the motorcycle and angle grinder. I do not ignore that the premises were ransacked by the offender and RB. The Crown has conceded that the offence was not planned nor part of an organised criminal activity. 20. The offender gave to Greg Tryer, a clinical psychologist, an account in August 2008 that is different from the agreed facts. While he was not cross-examined on the account he gave, I note his counsel signed the agreed facts in September 2008, that is a month after this offender spoke to Mr Tryer. My findings of fact are based upon the agreed statement which is made later in time than on the account given by this offender to Mr Tryer.21. The Crown submitted that this offender was the eldest in the group, twenty-one years. Damage was occasioned to a window and doors. The house was ransacked. Real and aesthetic value of items stolen was substantial. That submission appears well founded. Based upon that submission, the Crown argued the offender’s criminality therefore fell towards the midrange of seriousness. On the agreed facts this offender’s criminality is greater than others. RB was fortunate in that the agreed facts in his case painted him in a more favourable position than the agreed facts in Mr McHughes case would have painted him. 22. There are factors which place this offender below the midrange of seriousness. The Crown concedes it was not planned. The four persons constituting the co-accused were young, all were apparently inexperienced, lacking in any real expertise. I am satisfied the premises were not specifically targeted for the purposes of exploiting the real value of the coin collection. Indeed, as I earlier remarked, they had no idea of its real or aesthetic value. There is no evidence before me establishing this offender had any knowledge of the coin collection until after the safe was opened. From his own admission he claims to have been called to the premises because of the safe. Well the agreed facts place him in the house from the outset. The admission, that is that he was called to the house, if accepted, establishes no more than he knew of the existence of the safe before his arrival. It certainly does not establish prior knowledge of the safe’s contents. He claims to have received about $90 as proceeds of this burglary. Even though the coin collection was valuable, it does not appear those who stole it appreciated that fact. Really there is nothing in the evidence disputing McHughes claim, nor was he cross-examined on it, but in fairness his cross-examination was cut short because he became seriously distressed in the witness box. The facts establish this offence falls below the midrange of seriousness but the offence does otherwise qualify on its objective facts as serious.Subjective Facts – Personal Circumstances, Background, Family Dynamics23. Born in 1986 this offender was twenty-one at the time of offending and twenty-two at the time of sentence. McHughes is a single man, the second of four children. His family is still intact. He was raised in Brewarrina. His parents have been strongly supportive of him, attending court in Sydney. His father is a drug and alcohol counsellor at Orana Haven for the past five years. The offender is currently in no relationship and has no children. Mr McHughes would be welcome back into the family home, but may be considering moving from Brewarrina. In August 2008 he told Greg Tryer:  
     
      
      “I’m going all right, but I want to get out. I can get a job in Nyngan. I reckon that would be good. I’d have work. I’d have money. I wouldn’t have to hang around with those other fellows at home. I don’t know anybody there [Nyngan]. I want to meet new people and get on a new track. I want to turn my life around and stay out of prison...I know if I go back home I’ll get into trouble again.” 
       
       
      
    Education, Training and Skills24. Cecil McHughes has serious intellectual deficits, a topic to which I shall return, but that would explain, at least in part, why he left school aged thirteen prior to completing year seven. His father says he had ADHD problems. He has not completed further education, but has been employed in a number of unskilled positions. His expressive and receptive language skills are restricted causing him difficulty in understanding the tenor of conversations going on about him or sometimes in which he is involved. Mr Tryer spoke of the need to explain and elaborate on questions he (Tryer) put to Mr McHughes. He also told Tryer that he did not understand what went on in court but would have his solicitor explain it when court had finished. He spoke of being without mates in gaol. It may be he is becoming isolated because of communication barriers. He has done cotton chipping, mowing lawns and gardening as part of a CDEP program. They have indicated a willingness to hold a position for him. The CDEP program is part-time work. He has some experience in shearing and would like to learn the trade. By far and away his greatest skills are on the rugby league football field, where he plays five-eight or centres. He has played under eighteens and when the senior teams were short, he volunteered to play in the senior grades.General Health25. So far as one can ascertain the offender appears to be a fit athletic twenty-two year old. He told Greg Tryer that he had broken his leg in a football game. I am unaware whether there are any lingering issues in relation to that broken leg.Mental Health Issues26. Although strictly not a mental health issue, he has been assessed as being in the mild range of developmental disability in respect of his intellectual functioning. His best scores come in arithmetic, block design and object assembly. 27. They are said to range between borderline developmental disability and low average. So assessed, his intellectual functioning falls below ninety-nine percent of the population of his age. He has been assessed as having a permanent disability, his deficits include impairment in comprehension, verbal reasoning, concentration, attention, vocabulary, short term auditory memory, social judgment, sequencing, identifying cause and consequent relationships and general knowledge. 28. He has been taking olanzepine, a psychotic drug used in the treatment of schizophrenia, bi-polar disorder and acute psychosis, for hearing voices. So he has been taking olanzepine for hearing voices. He claims to have been sent to Bloomfield Hospital, probably in 2005 suffering from acute psychosis. He was discharged after five days and told to abstain from cannabis use and seek drug and alcohol counselling. I would draw from this that his psychosis was caused by, or aggravated by, his serious cannabis abuse. There may also be traumatic brain damage. He claims to have been dropped on his head as a child and has struck his head on a rock when diving into a river at the age of seventeen. So on that occasion there was a wound, he went to hospital where he lost consciousness. On the evidence before me, I am unable to say if there is any brain damage but I certainly do not rule it out. There is a history of petrol sniffing which may also raise an issue of brain damage as sequelae.  Drug and Alcohol History29. He claims to have commenced drinking at the age of sixteen, using heroin at the age of seventeen. I have just mentioned his petrol sniffing. He has used speed. He has used cannabis. I am satisfied there is a protracted history of alcohol and drug abuse and I include petrol in that category. He claims and there is no reason to doubt, that at the time of his offending, he was intoxicated by the effects of marijuana and alcohol. There appears to be widespread abuse within his immediate extended family of both drugs and alcohol. The exceptions appear to be his father and one of his brothers. 30. The Probation and Parole report observes McHughes “Has yet to address these issues and seems to lack the capacity and the motivation at this time.” With respect that is not quite true, there is one prior admission to Orana Haven. He spent about one month there and was discharged upon an allegation of stealing. He denies any involvement in that but I note that he was not discharged because of a return to drug use at that time. It was upon questioning in cross-examination on the subject of his discharge from Orana Haven that he became seriously distressed. 31. At this time and distance from the event, I am unable to determine the truth of the matter, and indeed unable to entirely satisfy myself as to the basis upon which he became seriously distressed. There are a number of possibilities including difficulty in comprehending and answering the question or a sensitivity about the issue that had discharged him from Orana Haven. More importantly, he has indicated a desire to try again. While his father cannot interfere with his program or treatment by other case workers at Orana Haven, his daily presence at the site must be an additional support for McHughes. Given his other impediments, such a support assumes an importance.Character and Criminal History32. Cecil McHughes is a young twenty-two year old, blessed with athleticism, eye-hand coordination, and a capacity to read the play on a football field. He has in the past exhibited a reasonable work ethic, being able to do a range of jobs, primarily outdoor type work. 33. Putting to one side his work and sport environments, he does though face real problems with understanding and participating in discussions. It is not surprising he was interacting with persons substantially younger than he on the night of this offence. I see some danger in him becoming socially isolated, a matter which those who are concerned with his rehabilitation, should seek to address. His first criminal entry appears to be in 2003, when he was dealt with in Brewarrina Children’s Court for aggravated break, enter and steal. There are other break, enter and steal offences in 2004 (Children’s Court) x 1 and 2005 (Local Court) x 2. For one offence he was given eighteen months with a twelve month non-parole period. That sentence was suspended. However he breached the s 12 bond. On 21 March 2006, the suspension was lifted. He served twelve months, was released to parole on 8 March, 2008. This offence occurred during the six month parole period. There are two further court appearances in the local court relating to a number of driving of motor vehicle offences. There is a fifth break and enter offence in 2006 for which he received six months imprisonment concurrently with the twelve month non-parole period earlier referred to. There are nuisance type offences committed no doubt, when he was drinking in public. But for the five break and enter offences, his record would not be all that troubling. Approach to the Standard Non-Parole Period 34. I have already assessed this offence on its objective facts as one that is serious, but not so serious as to fall within the mid-range of seriousness. There is one important aggravating feature on the subjective material, that is the commission of this offence whilst on parole for an offence of a similar kind. There are four prior break and enter offences. In his recent past, they disentitle him to any leniency he may be entitled to on account of prior good character. However his cognitive disabilities, particularly as they affect his social judgment and incapacity in identifying cause and consequence of acts, are in my view playing some part in his frequent involvement in crime. It is likely they played some part in his involvement in this offence. 35. Given that he falls into the bottom one percent of his age group in terms of cognitive and developmental ability, he is not a suitable candidate for deterrence. I am satisfied the standard non-parole period was set by parliament with a view to deterring offenders. Those at the extreme edge of the lower cognitive and developmental disability, are therefore not suitable candidates for a standard non-parole period. I find that a standard non-parole period would not apply in this case. 36. Two further factors influence me in the approach that I have taken in this sentencing. At the time of his offending, this offender was relatively young (R v Hearne (2007) 124 AcrR 457). Secondly, since March of 2006, a period of thirty-four months on my calculation, he has been incarcerated for twenty-seven of them. He has a sixty-six percent probability, at least statistically, of returning to prison within two years. In such circumstances it is really in the community’s interests to try to address matters that may contribute to him being exposed to greater vulnerability of offending.  Beginning the Process of Accountability37. As I have said at the outset, Cecil McHughes must be accountable for his criminality. My view this is a case calling for “compulsory rehabilitation” see Griffith v The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 293. In this case I am seeking to put in place strategies that will assist McHughes avoid re-offending and thereby protect the far west New South Wales community from any further offending. Issues that need to be addressed include:38. His drug and alcohol addiction - rehabilitation - abstinence39. Strategies to deal with potential social isolation - sport, employment training40. Strategies to deal with mental health problems - medication counselling41. Strategies to permit him to cope given cognitive and developmental disabilities - driver’s licence, accommodation, personal support program, s 11 bail.42. I have determined that this offender shall be given an opportunity to demonstrate that he can rehabilitate in the areas that I have just identified. It is my view that if those areas are adequately addressed, the likelihood of his re-offending is much diminished. For that purpose I propose firstly to address the issue of drug and alcohol addiction by requiring him to attend full time, the Orana Haven Institute. I have before me a letter accepting him into Orana Haven. The reason that this matter has been put on today was because Orana Haven has been closed over Christmas but was opening sometime today. 43. The offender has to understand that in the event there is a breach of this s.11 bail, the options available to me, or the choices available to me, become very limited. This is a serious offence and in the event that there is an absence of rehabilitation, the only sentence available is full-time custody. In the event that there is rehabilitation, the need for full-time custody, particularly given his age and the disability, becomes diminished. I stand this matter over for finalisation to a date twelve months from today. The offender will be granted bail for the purposes of establishing whether he can rehabilitate. That bail will be conditional. The conditions are these: 
     
     That he is to be of good behaviour. 
     That he is to reside at Orana Haven - we have the address for Orana Haven which I will have inserted in the bail. 
     That he is to accept supervision by his case manager at Orana Haven and obey all reasonable directions from his case manager at Orana Haven. 
     That he is to abstain from the consumption of all alcoholic beverages for the duration of the bail. 
     That he is to abstain from the consumption of all non-prescribed illicit drugs for the duration of the bail. 
     That he is to submit to random breath and urine analysis tests for the purpose of detecting the consumption of alcohol or drugs. Detection of alcohol or drugs will be deemed a breach of bail. Any refusal to participate in a breath or urine test will be deemed a breach of bail. Any dirty drug or alcohol test will be deemed a breach of bail. A dirty breath test will be defined as where the alcohol content is at or higher than zero point zero one grams of alcohol from one hundred millilitres of blood. The supply of urine sourced from another person is deemed a breach of bail.  
     He will accept supervision by Probation and Parole and accept all reasonable directions by his case manager with probation and parole. 
     He will report to the court on four occasions during the bail period. 
     He will provide proof of competing or participating in each of the activities that forms part of his bail. 
     When he has completed Orana Haven, he will reside with his parents.  
     He will seek to obtain selection in a rugby league or rugby union football club of his choice and will attend all training sessions as directed by the coach or selectors. 
     When he has completed Orana Haven, he is to subject himself to random urinalysis at least three times monthly to be conducted by Probation and Parole or at their direction. 
     He is to approach Centrelink or some other employment agency and enrol with them seeking a personal support manager in their Newstart program. 
     He is to enrol in, as matters presently stand anyway, the shearing course.  
     He is to take any prescribed medication in accordance with doctor’s orders. 
     He is at the conclusion of Orana Haven to continue with counselling to be determined and I want to look again at the question of accommodation in case he wants to move to Nyngan late in the piece. Maybe you might want to move to Nyngan towards the end of this bail next year or later this year and we will look at that when the time comes.  
     HIS HONOUR: Mr McHughes, you are going to come to my court on 6 April to tell me how you are going at Orana Haven, do you understand that?OFFENDER: Yes.HIS HONOUR: Your bail may be entered before the Governor of the gaol or his delegate so you can tell them now that you are on bail and I will have this faxed through. Have you got one of the officers there with you?OFFENDER: Yes he is just outside.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Kyle Tregonning pleaded guilty in the Local Court to an offence of aggravated break, enter and steal. In order to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea, the sentence I will ultimately impose upon her is twenty-five per cent less than it would otherwise be.2 Ms Tregonning has been in custody for a significant part of her life. Recently she was serving a sentence for break, enter and steal. The non-parole period expired in October 2007. Less than two months later she had breached her parole and was back in custody. She remained there until 12 February 2009 when she was again released to parole. A mere eleven days later she committed the offence which now brings her before the court. 3 She explains that she was in a halfway house, but when they discovered that she had purchased or used some marijuana she was told to leave, and was thus homeless. She has been a drug user for many years, using either heroin or amphetamines, depending on what was available. 4 She says that she met up with another drug user, who said that he could go and get either drugs or money from a friend of his. Ms Tregonning waited, but when the man had not come back for a while she made further inquiries and discovered that he had in fact broken into some premises. He told her to pick up as much stuff as she could. As the two of them were doing this, the owner of the apartment came home. He saw two strangers in his lounge room and gave chase. The offender’s friend ran away, as did the offender herself. She was caught. 5 The property found upon her consisted of a couple of wrist watches and coins, a mobile phone, headphones and a Westpac bank card. The facts are silent as to whether the victim of the offence lost other property. The facts are silent as to whether the man who had not been caught could perhaps have taken other property away with him. 6 After the owner of the apartment grabbed Ms Tregonning the police arrived, she was arrested and has remained in custody since that date.7 She has had an upbringing which can fairly be described as traumatic. She is Aboriginal and has suffered some of the hardships which are commonly associated with Aboriginal people as she grew up. In addition, she has suffered from a former boyfriend being killed in a motorcycle accident, her sister dying of cancer, and her mother then telling her that she would have preferred that it was her, that is the offender, who died rather than her sister. She was sexually assaulted as a child, and although she has five children none of them have lived with her for any significant period. This is no doubt in the best interests of the children because of the lifestyle pursued by the offender. 8 She is a drug user. She is addicted to drugs and she commits crimes in order to satisfy that addiction. Indeed, as I have made clear, this offence was committed by the offender as part of her desire to obtain either heroin or amphetamines.9 The offender’s criminal history and the fact that she was on parole at the time of this offence demonstrate a continuing attitude of disobedience towards the law. 10 The offence carries a maximum penalty of twenty years with a standard non-parole period of five years. That standard non-parole period is not of direct application because of her plea of guilty, but it remains as a guidepost to the sentence I should impose. The fact that the offence is one of those which Parliament has attached to standard a non-parole period is indicative of the seriousness with which Parliament has said offences of this kind should be treated.11 I am satisfied that the offence is below the mid range of objective seriousness for offences of this type. There is no evidence that any internal damage or ransacking of the victim’s premises and the offence occurred at a time when it was entirely possible that the premises would be vacant and, indeed, they were at the time the initial break-in occurred. There is no evidence of any significant quantity of material being taken, nor is there any evidence that some of the property was unrecovered. In those circumstances the objective seriousness is, as I have said, below the middle of the range.12 There is no evidence of any significant planning, at least on behalf of the offender. If she is to be believed, her decision to become involved in the offence was a spontaneous one. Nevertheless, she did in pursuit of her desire to obtain drugs, seemingly without hesitation involve herself in this offence as soon as she realised what was going on.13 One of the most significant matters relevant both to the offender’s upbringing and the sentence to be imposed concerns her mental illness. A report of Dr Wilcox, received without objection, sets out in some detail the difficulties Ms Tregonning has. Her mental illness seems to be related to the offence too through her drug use, so it’s appropriate that I give less weight to general deterrence than would otherwise be the case. However, notwithstanding a submission by Mr Rogers, I am satisfied that personal deterrence remains of significant importance, even if the offender herself is less influenced by the prospect of time in custody than other people might be.14 It is also important to bear in mind the loss that the community feels through offences of this kind. The loss extends beyond the feelings expressed or felt by the victim in this case. Offences of this type are distressingly common, and law abiding citizens, especially in some areas, are forced to, in effect, barricade their homes in order to deter people such as the offender who care very little for the legitimate property rights of others in the community. 15 A sentence which will effectively prevent Ms Tregonning from committing offences of this kind in the future by ensuring that she remains in custody for some time is necessary. Of course, I am not entitled to increase the sentence I would otherwise impose because of preventative detention beyond that which is appropriate given the objective seriousness of her conduct. No, I have not done that. 16 The prospects of Ms Tregonning’s rehabilitation are poor. I will be making a recommendation to do what I can to promote that possibility. The offender has been in custody since 23 February 2009, and although some part of that sentence was referable to her earlier offending, I will date the sentence I am about to announce from then as a matter of discretion.17 I sentence the offender to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of two and a half years to date from 23 February 2009, which will expire on 22 August 2011. I set a head sentence of five years. 18 Although because of the length of the sentence I have just announced, it is not me who sets Ms Tregonning’s conditions of parole. It is my strong recommendation that upon release to parole she is supervised by the Probation and Parole Service closely and, indeed, intensively, otherwise Ms Tregonning will be back in custody at great cost to both her and the community.

    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: Many innocent people face trial for serious charges and are acquitted. The default position, if I can call it that, is that such people do not have costs awarded in their favour. Society accepts that innocent people will often have to pay the costs of a criminal trial, even one in which they are found not guilty. That is the price to pay for living in a society where disputes regarding credible allegations of wrongdoing are resolved by the courts rather than by the prosecutor. They are resolved in public rather than in private. 2 Of course, this is not a universal rule. There are situations where the law requires that costs are awarded in favour of a successful former accused. One of those situations is governed by the Costs in Criminal Cases Act, the Act under which the present application is brought.3 On Monday, the then accused, JS, pleaded not guilty to an indictment containing six counts. They all allege that he had done some sexual activity with a named complainant without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting. The first witness in the prosecution case was the complainant. There were many problems in her credibility revealed in the course of her evidence, and I will deal with them later. Those problems continued when other evidence was called in the Crown case, to the extent that at the close of the Crown case I gave the jury a Prasad direction. They considered that matter over lunch and returned with verdicts of not guilty on each of the six counts.4 The counts all related to the events said to have occurred in Gordon Park in the early hours of 2 August 2008. It was the complainant’s evidence that those events occurred without her consent, but it was the accused’s case, as revealed in cross-examination of the complainant and in Mr Rosser’s opening to the jury, that what occurred was with the complainant’s consent. The jury were clearly not satisfied on the complainant’s evidence that the Crown was capable of proving the absence of consent.5 The application, as I said, is brought under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act. That Act says that I am able to grant a certificate to the accused where he has been acquitted, provided that I specify that, if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings, and secondly, that any act or omission of the defendant that contributed or might have contributed to the institution or continuation of the proceedings, was reasonable in the circumstances. 6 The matter has been argued before me today on the basis of the evidence admitted in the trial. There has been no application for me to consider any further evidence beyond that which the jury heard. Nor has it been suggested by the prosecution that there was any act by the defendant which has contributed to the institution or continuation of the proceedings. That leaves for me to consider the question as to whether it was reasonable, on the material that I heard in the trial, to have instituted these proceedings.7 The case is clearly one where the credibility of the complainant was fundamentally relevant. In R v Manley 49 NSWLR 203 at [14], Wood CJ at CL says,  
     
      
      “Given the wide variety of cases that might arise for consideration, I am ... reluctant to attempt any exhaustive definition of the test. It seems to me that the section calls for an objective analysis of the whole of the relevant evidence and particularly the extent to which there is any contradiction of expert evidence concerning central facts necessary to establish guilt or inherent weaknesses in a prosecution case”. 
      
    8 (I interpolate here that Manley, of course, was a case where expert evidence was crucially important, the Crown and the accused in that case relying on contradictory expert evidence.) Wood CJ at CL continues,  
     
      
      “Matters of judgment concerning credibility, demeanour and the like are likely to fall on the other side of the line of unreasonableness, being matters quintessentially within the realm of the trier of fact, whether it be judge or jury”. 
       
      
    9 Of course, the Crown relies on that latter aspect of the case. The Crown said that this was a matter that depended ultimately on the credibility and demeanour of the complainant, and that was properly a matter to be put before a tribunal of fact.10 I accept, of course, that ordinarily, as Wood CJ at CL said, cases where the credibility of a witness is at issue are quintessentially matters for a trier of fact to be resolved in public by a court, rather than in private by the prosecuting authority. But of course, that is not universally the case by any means. There are cases, and I am satisfied this is one, where there were so many difficulties with the complainant’s credibility as regards the central allegation the jury had to determine, that it was not reasonable to institute the proceedings. I am satisfied that the case that the prosecution had was so inherently weak that any conviction of the accused would have been, frankly, perverse.11 Let me detail eight matters which were significant impediments to the success of the prosecution case. Of course, these are not to be looked at in isolation, but the effect of them is to be considered as a whole. 12 Firstly, I mentioned before the complainant said that she had had non-consensual sex with the then accused in the early hours of 2 August 2008. It is the case that before that, the complainant and the then accused had been what the complainant described as “secret lovers”. They would meet up regularly and in the course of those meetings sexual activity short of sexual intercourse would take place. Indeed, on one occasion prior to 2 August 2008 the complainant asked the accused to have sexual intercourse with her, but he refused. 13 Secondly, there is a long delay between 2 August 2008 and when matters were drawn to the attention of the police. This is not unusual of course. There are many cases where a complainant says that, for valid reasons, he or she delayed making a complaint. Indeed, there is statutory recognition of that, being a matter which is often to be found in cases of this kind. What is unusual, however, is the explanation which the complainant offered. It was not a case of her saying such things as, “It took me a while to pluck up the courage to go to the police”. Her explanation was that she only belatedly realised that she had been raped, that is, she only belatedly realised that the then accused had had sexual intercourse with her without her consent.14 She was cross-examined, as you might expect, about this explanation and her explanation did not, to my mind, make a great deal of sense. According to her, when she complained to the police she had not learned anything that she did not know on 2 August 2008. It was difficult, therefore, to determine why it would be that she only realised that she had been raped so long after the event.15 The third matter concerns events which occurred after 2 August 2008. It is the case that relatively soon afterwards the complainants and the then accused had consensual sexual intercourse. It is remarkable that the complainant, who says that she had been violently raped on a picnic table in a park in the middle of winter, and received a significant bruise in he process, would have consensual sexual intercourse with a person who had raped her shortly after those alleged events. Once more the complainant offered an explanation which did not really explain such unusual conduct. 16 The fourth matter concerns admitted lies told by the complainant - lies which, somewhat remarkably, she had not corrected in one particular aspect. It was clear that both the then accused and the complainant said that there were three incidents of sexual intercourse, one the complainant said was non-consensual and two that the complainant says were consensual. As at 2 August 2008 the complainant had a boyfriend. He is still her boyfriend to this day. She has told him that all three acts of intercourse were non-consensual. Somewhat remarkably, she has still not told him the truth. He, when giving evidence yesterday, was of the opinion that the complainant had been raped three times by the accused. All of us in court were in the very uncomfortable position of knowing a bit more about his relationship with the complainant than he did. 17 Allied to this is the fifth matter. The complainant lied to her boyfriend, also about the circumstances of the meeting in the park. She told him that the then accused was walking her home after having been at a party, when in truth they met up at the park by prior arrangement. The complainant’s boyfriend only learned the truth about this during cross-examination by Mr Rosser.18 The sixth matter is that complainant gave evidence that she had spoken to a number of people about the events of 2 August 2008, in particular her friends. But what she says she told them was not corroborated, and indeed was contradicted, by the evidence given by those friends. In no case did any Crown witness say that the complainant had told him or her that the events of 2 August 2008 involved non-consensual sex.19 The seventh matter is perhaps one of the most important. It concerns the circumstances in which the complainant undeniably made an allegation that the accused had sexually assaulted her. The complainant’s boyfriend had harboured suspicions about the nature of her relationship with the accused. He confronted her with the allegation that she had had sex with him. In response to that confrontation, the complainant first said that she had been sexually assaulted by the then accused. It will be remembered that she said this happened on three occasions. There is thus considerable scope for the view that the complainant may well have been motivated to cover up the fact that she was cheating on her boyfriend by falsely alleging that everything that occurred between them was done without her consent.20 Finally, we have the circumstance that the accused is a man of good character. There was both negative and positive evidence in this regard. The negative evidence was that he had never been convicted of any criminal offence or been arrested for anything in the past. The positive evidence came from Crown witnesses, who suggested that the behaviour described by the complainant was entirely inconsistent with the behaviour that they had observed, including two other women who had had a sexual relationship with him.21 Of course, the Crown is able to say that much of the material tending to suggest a lack of credibility of the complainant came from the complainant herself, which somewhat paradoxically might be thought to add to her credibility. The Crown also relies on the injury that the complainant received and the distress she exhibited at various times. However, the injury and the distress are, in the circumstances of this case, entirely neutral. They are consistent with the version given by the accused, that being rather unsatisfactory consensual sex in the park and an ongoing secret relationship which had to be kept secret from the then accused’s girlfriend and the complainant’s boyfriend.22 The Crown also relies on what it says is an admission, the accused saying to police that he believed that he and the complainant had “sorted out”, in their discussions, the incident of 2 August 2008. Perhaps that it slightly more consistent with an admission of wrongdoing than an admission of unsatisfactory consensual sex, but it can be easily interpreted as consistent with innocence. It is certainly not something which significantly affects the problems with the complainant’s credibility as regards the central allegations in this case, namely, is what occurred on 2 August 2008 something that occurred with her consent or without her consent? 23 In my view, when I consider all of the material and matters that I have just referred to, it was not reasonable to institute these proceedings. Far from the defendant contributing to the institution of the proceedings or their continuation, his solicitor invited the prosecution to terminate these proceedings. That invitation is something which, in my view, should have been quite quickly accepted.24 This is one of those rare cases where the decision should have been made by the prosecuting authority in private that these proceedings should either not have been instituted, or once they were instituted should have been terminated at a very early stage. I therefore grant a certificate to the then accused, under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act. I state that if the prosecution had before the proceedings were instituted been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings. I also state that any act or omission of the defendant that contributed or might have contributed to the institution or continuation of proceedings was reasonable in the circumstances. I state those matters in those terms because of the statutory requirement, but I repeat that in my view there was no act or omission of the defendant that contributed, or might have contributed, to the institution or continuation of the proceedings.

     Daniel Tasman GORDON v REGINA 
      
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1 GROVE J: When this appeal was called on for hearing counsel for the appellant sought to amend the grounds of appeal to add an additional ground which has been articulated as follows:  
     
      
       
        
         
        ""The verdict was unsafe and/or dangerous in all the circumstances of the proceedings"".  
        
       
       
        
       
      
    2 In response to enquiry from the Bench counsel has elaborated that ground by particularizing the focus of complaint upon two matters. First, it is contended that there was some undue time pressure upon the jury, and second, that, if permitted, evidence could be given of an observation of one of the jurors appearing to be distressed at the time of returning of the verdict.  
     
      
    3 The issue in the trial was narrow, and the totality of the evidence was relatively brief. The record shows that the jury retired at 12.58 on a Friday. The record also shows that from time to time during the afternoon the jury returned to Court in order to obtain further direction and to be reminded of some of the evidence that they had heard or, in the case of a CCTV product, that they had seen. 
     
      
    4 The jury returned its verdict of guilty at 6.35 p.m. that night. It is significant to note that during the afternoon the jury had been told by his Honour in relation to the time of the afternoon that if they wished to go home at something of the order of half past five there was no problem, and they could come back on Monday. He also told them that they could stay on if they wanted to. There is no indication at all of any undue pressure being placed upon the jury.  
     
      
    5 It is true, as I have observed, that the jury were embarked upon deliberations on a Friday afternoon, but that of itself is not a reason which would give rise to a reasonable complaint. The observation of the juror, assuming for present purposes that evidence to that effect could be given, is something which is commonly experienced by presiding Judges. That is to say, observation is made that jurors returning a verdict have been distressed by the enormity of the serious task upon which they have been engaged.  
     
      
    6 Although the ground as formulated does not articulate it in these terms, it must be that what is complained of is that, for one or other or both of the reasons particularised, miscarriage can be observed.  
     
      
    7 In my view that observation or conclusion would not be available from the material which is before the Court. The Crown opposes the amendment. I consider the Crown opposition is well founded, and I would refuse leave to amend the ground.  
     
      
    8 BLANCH J: I agree.  
     
      
    9 PRICE J: I agree.

     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is a Crown appeal asserting the manifest inadequacy of sentence imposed by Nicholson DCJ in the District Court in proceedings which were heard in Bourke and later in Sydney. The respondent had been committed for sentence after pleading guilty in Bourke Local Court to a charge of entering a dwelling house with intent to commit a serious indictable offence in circumstances of special aggravation contrary to s 111(3) of the Crimes Act 1900. The specified offence was assault occasioning actual bodily harm and the circumstance of special aggravation was that he wounded the occupant of the house. 
     
      
    2 The structure of applicable maximum penalties pursuant to s 111 is that entry with relevant intent is punishable by up to ten years imprisonment but up to fourteen years in circumstances of aggravation and up to twenty years in circumstances of special aggravation. Section 105A prescribes that wounding any person is a circumstance of special aggravation. 
     
      
    3 His Honour sentenced the respondent to imprisonment for twelve months which he suspended upon entry by the respondent into a bond to be of good behaviour for that period pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The expressed reason for not specifying a non parole period and imposing a fixed term was the intention to suspend the sentence. His Honour also imposed a number of conditions which were, in short, that the respondent accept supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and follow the reasonable directions of the officers of that Service, that he submit to random urine analysis three times monthly during the first six months of sentence and thereafter once per month, and to supply to the Probation and Parole officer each month during the currency of the bond a “report or some evidence” that the respondent had been attending counselling for mental health problems through the Darling River Medical Centre. Whether the lastmentioned condition is sufficiently certain to be valid is not an issue in this appeal: cf R v Bugmy [2004] NSWCCA 258 and compliance with these conditions as stated should, for the purposes of the appeal, be regarded as contributors to the punishment imposed. 
     
      
    4 The learned sentencing judge recounted the facts in much detail and what was said has not been challenged and can be regarded as accepted. A summary now will suffice. 
     
      
    5 The respondent had been in a relationship with a female who was, at the time of the offence, aged seventeen years and I will refer to her simply as “CD”. At a previous time CD had been in another relationship with one Aaron McKellar. As at 16 July 2005 the respondent and CD were parents of a child who had been born in April 2004. Both the respondent and Aaron McKellar in fact have children from former relationships other than with CD. 
     
      
    6 Several days beforehand an argument occurred between the respondent and CD because she was “running around” with McKellar. Consequently the respondent packed his belongings into his car and he was, in effect, sleeping in and living from the vehicle. 
     
      
    7 On the evening of 16 July the respondent encountered a relative of McKellar and drove him to the latter’s house. CD was there. The respondent made derogatory comments to her and argument erupted. The respondent left the house and went to his car but he returned with a baseball bat from among his belongings and re-entered the house. He struck McKellar three or four times with the bat causing a laceration to his head which required stitching and the fracture of a finger bone. The respondent was then confronted by two male relatives of McKellar and he left. In the meantime, McKellar acquired the baseball bat and used it to shatter the windows of the respondent’s car. McKellar was subsequently taken to hospital for treatment where he was discharged after a stay of about ten hours.  
     
      
    8 The respondent gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings. He told his Honour that he had no excuse and that anger had got the better of him. He had earlier been drinking. He also said in response to a question by his Honour that he was “firmly under the belief that eventually he (McKellar) was going to attack me” but no claim of self defence was advanced. 
     
      
    9 In his remarks on sentence his Honour stated the age of the respondent to be twenty four years whereas in fact at the time he was twenty six years of age. He also referred to the maximum penalty for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm as two years imprisonment but this is applicable to common assault and the correct figure is five years imprisonment.  
     
      
    10 The Crown has also drawn attention to a number of references by his Honour to the respondent’s formation of an intention to commit the stated serious indictable offence including: 
     
      
       
        
        “It will become obvious as I continue on that I have some concerns about whether I ought to have accepted that plea because it seems to me that it may well have been after he entered the second time that he formed the intent to strike McKellar.” 
        
       
       
      and 
       
       
        
        “The attack on Aaron McKellar appears to have occurred on impulse. There is some doubt in my mind as to whether as (the respondent) returned he was intending to hit anyone. He had been abusing CD in the bedroom. He had told Wilson (the passenger whom he had transported) that he was angry with CD. It was likely he was returning to give her more of what he had earlier given her. 
        
       
       
        
        Upon his return McKellar was the person nearest the front door. He was blocking (the respondent’s) access to CD, both metaphorically and physically. It is likely at that moment (the respondent) determined to strike McKellar with the intent of causing him at least physical pain.” 
        
       
      
    11 It was an essential element of the charge that the respondent harboured the intent to commit the serious indictable offence when he entered the dwelling and, despite those observations, it must be taken that the plea of guilty contained an admission of that fact. 
     
      
    12 The appellant presents submissions in support of the ground of manifest inadequacy under three express heads. The first two can conveniently be dealt with together as they were in the Crown written submissions. They are: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) His Honour failed to appreciate the gravamen of the offence. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (b) His Honour failed to acknowledge the seriousness of the injury sustained.” 
        
       
      
    13 It was essential for the culpability of the respondent to be assessed against his acceptance that he entered McKellar’s house with the specific intent of committing assault occasioning actual bodily harm and that he in fact wounded the victim. To achieve this he had armed himself with the baseball bat which is in the category of being an offensive weapon. 
     
      
    14 In reference to the element of wounding his Honour said in his remarks: 
     
      
       
        
        “The wound itself, while occasioned in a vulnerable area of the body was, as events turned out, not life threatening, although there is some suggestion of concussion, nor did it amount to more than actual bodily harm. As such, this was towards the lower end of the range of seriousness for offences so described.” 
        
       
      
    15 Maliciously inflicting actual bodily harm is a circumstance of aggravation elevating an offence contrary to s 111 so as to make available a fourteen year maximum penalty. The offence charged to which the respondent pleaded guilty was in the specially aggravated category by reason of his wounding McKellar and attracted a twenty year maximum penalty prescription.  
     
      
    16 Actual bodily harm includes any hurt or injury calculated to interfere with the health or comfort of the victim: R v Donovan 1934 2 KB 498, whereas wounding requires the breaking or cutting of the interior layer of the skin and it does not suffice to cut merely the outer layer of skin: R v Smith 1837 8 C & P 173. 
     
      
    17 The Crown contention that his Honour’s remark reveals an error should be sustained. That said, it still needs to be recognized that the consequences of wounding can vary widely and the level of the wound to the victim in this instance can be gauged against the ingredients and the requisite treatment which I have described above. Fortunately, the wounding did not result in injuries which were in the category of very great seriousness. So to say is not to minimize the culpability of the respondent for the attack which his Honour rightly called cowardly. 
     
      
    18 The third submission of the Crown was expressed: 
     
      
       
        
        “(c) His Honour accorded too much weight to the age of the respondent.” 
        
       
      
    19 I have already noted what is conceded to be a minor inaccuracy of his Honour’s statement of the age of the respondent, however, it is noteworthy that the first word in his Honour’s remarks on sentence was “youth.” He made repeated references to this factor when dealing with antecedents and rehabilitation prospects in particular. When referring to the latter he observed that the respondent did not come before the courts until the age of twenty one and, given the difficult circumstances of his upbringing which he detailed, the comment that this was creditable was clearly justified. It also provided a sound basis for contemplation that the respondent may be able to re-establish himself in a life free of offending. 
     
      
    20 It is not, of course, exactly discernible how much weight his Honour gave to the respondent’s youth or how it was precisely reflected in the sentence imposed, but I am not able to conclude that “too much weight” was given to this factor. 
     
      
    21 Nevertheless, having regard to the overall circumstances of the offence and the injury to the victim and to the contentions of the Crown which I consider should be sustained, I conclude that the sentence is manifestly inadequate in the sense that the ancillary order for suspension excessively ameliorated any element of punishment for the crime. 
     
      
    22 There remains, however, in this Court a residual discretion which may be exercised to dismiss a Crown appeal. In determining whether such a discretion should be implemented it is appropriate to consider what has happened in the interim. I note that on the day of imposition (30 June 2006) the respondent had travelled from Bourke to Sydney and he was accompanied by both his mother and CD with whom he had resumed relationship and, as was put, the matters of tension between them had “resolved themselves.” 
     
      
    23 When the appeal was called this morning, again the respondent was present with what appear to be members of his family. In addition, the court has been provided with the affidavits of the respondent affirmed on 9 October 2006 and of his solicitor affirmed on 10 October 2006. 
     
      
    24 Exhibited to the latter affidavit of Stella Calomeris is a further report from the Probation and Parole Service in Bourke which shows, as is affirmed in the affidavit of the respondent, that he made every effort to comply with the conditions of his bond but the approach seemed to be taken by the Probation and Parole personnel that once the appeal by the Crown was lodged they did not have any function in regard to the sentence. 
     
      
    25 It is not a present issue before this Court as to whether or not that stance is correct. What is important, in my view, for present purposes is that the evidence shows a bona fide attempt by the respondent to improve himself. The updated Probation and Parole Report is promising indeed and there is a summary, which I will quote, which seems to me to adequately fit the situation. The author of the report, Ms Dewar said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Hatch is a young man who appears to have acted without due thought for the consequences resultant in the matter now before the Court. However, he has since made some positive attitudinal and lifestyle changes, coupled with securing employment which has increased his sense of responsibility. To his credit he may have seen the error of his ways and is endeavouring to adapt more lawfully which may augur well for the future.” 
        
       
      
    26 Although, as I have said, I regard the sentence imposed at first instance as manifestly inadequate, in all the circumstances I think it is an appropriate case for the exercise of the residual discretion of this Court. I would, therefore, propose that the Crown appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    27 TOBIAS JA: I agree with Grove J. 
     
      
    28 BELL J: I also agree. 
     
      
    29 TOBIAS JA: The order of the Court will be that the appeal is dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: This is an appeal from a conviction for possessing firearms and possessing prohibited weapons. There is only one ground of appeal: that the trial was a nullity because a juror became part of the jury contrary to the provisions of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW). The ground of appeal relies on a basic error in the constitution of the jury of the trial.  
     
      
    2 A juror who was meant to attend court for jury duty in October 2006 attended in September by mistake. This mistake was compounded by an exceptional coincidence that the juror who attended by mistake had the last three numbers of the call number shared with another juror who was called up for September, but did not in fact attend. This coincidence caused a series of events that led to the juror, who was not meant to attend for court duty on that day, to be selected on the panel which convicted the Appellant. 
     
      
    3 This is a fundamental error of the same character as that which led this Court in an earlier decision to conclude that the trial had been a nullity and that a new trial should be ordered. In written submissions filed before the hearing of this appeal, the Crown conceded that this was an error and that the decision of R v Brown (2004) 148 A Crim R 268 is not distinguishable. 
     
      
    4 The principle involved here is a basic one. Our criminal justice system depends on the complete randomness of selections of jurors. The system is based on a quite simple set of rules, of a character which are in substance self-executing. No one has to make a decision as to whether or not a particular error was of any significance in the particular circumstance or whether a person who attends, as occurred in this case, should be accepted if they give evidence about the nature of their mistake. Our jury system depends on the confidence of the public in the complete impartiality of the jurors. That impartiality is assured by having a simple set of rules that make it certain that individuals are selected at random to serve on juries.  
     
      
    5 It is regrettable when a technical error of this character has the consequence of rendering a trial invalid. However, on the previous authorities in this Court, that is the inevitable consequence of this error. 
     
      
    6 Accordingly, the orders sought by the Appellant, and to which the Crown accedes, ought to be made. 
     
      
    7 In my opinion, the orders of the Court should be conviction quashed and a new trial be held. 
     
      
    8 KIRBY J: I agree. 
     
      
    9 LATHAM J: I also agree.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: I agree. In my opinion it would have been preferable for the sentencing Judge to specify reasons for departing from the usual range of non-parole periods for Commonwealth offences. However, in the circumstances referred to by Price J, the absence of specific reasons in this case is not indicative of error justifying an appeal by the applicant being granted.2 HODGSON JA: The orders of the Court are leave to appeal is granted. Appeal dismissed. 3 HOWIE J: For the reasons given by the other two members of this Court, I agree with the orders. 4 PRICE J: This is an application for leave to appeal by Shahab Aghajani Bick (conveniently referred to as the applicant) against sentences imposed by her Honour Judge Ainslie – Wallace on 4 November 2005 for 14 offences in breach of the criminal law of the Commonwealth.5 On 9 February 2005 the applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to the following offences: 
     
      
      
      (a) 11 counts contrary to s 29 D of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1914 (Cth); 
      
      
      (b) 3 counts contrary to s 135 .1 (5) of the  
      Criminal Code 
       1995 (Cth). 
      
    6 There are two categories of offence of which the applicant is charged as during the course of his criminal conduct s 29 D of the Crimes Act was repealed. The section, however, continues to apply to offences committed before 24 May 2001.7 The maximum penalty for the offence of defrauding the Commonwealth against the now repealed s 29D of the Crimes Act was imprisonment for 10 years and / or a pecuniary penalty of $100,000. The pecuniary penalty increased to $110,000 for offences after 6 April 1995. The maximum penalty for the offences of dishonesty causing a loss against s 135 .1 (5) of the Criminal Code is imprisonment for 5 years or a pecuniary penalty of $33,000 or both. 8 The maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment for the offences against the Criminal Code was applied by her Honour to the offences contrary to the Crimes Act. It is unnecessary for present purposes to consider whether her Honour properly addressed this issue. This Court in R v Ida Ronen, Nitzan Ronen, Izhar Ronen [2006] NSW CCA 123 articulated the approach to be taken on sentence when an offence is repealed and a different offence with a reduced penalty is enacted.9 The approach taken, it suffices to state, by her Honour was favourable to the applicant. 10 Her Honour, it appears, sentenced the applicant as follows:(i) Counts 1 to 5 contrary to section 29 D of the Crimes Act and count 1 contrary to s 135 .1 (5) of the Criminal Code (payments in the name Henry Sakhofaghajan) to imprisonment for two years to date from 11 May 2004 and to expire on 10 May 2006; 
     
      
       
       
      
    (ii) Counts 6 to 8 contrary to section 29 D of the Crimes Act and Count 2 contrary to s 135 .1 (5) Criminal Code (payments in the name Hevosty Shahaboof Aghajani Bick then Jeff Brown) to imprisonment for two years to date from 11 May 2005 and to expire on 10 May 2007; 
     
      
    (iii) Counts 9 to 11 contrary to section 29 D of the Crimes Act and count 3 contrary to s 135.1 (5) Criminal Code (payments in the name Tohbistianbigor Ohbrnandez then Tony Manguerra) to imprisonment for 3 years to date from 11 November 2005 and to expire 10 November 2008.11 Her Honour imposed an aggregate effective head sentence of 4 years and 6 months to date from 11 May 2004 with a single non – parole period of 3 years and 6 months from that date and to expire on 10 November 2007. A single non – parole period was set in accordance with s 19 A B (1) of the Crimes Act. 12 The sole ground of appeal is the applicant’s contention that the non – parole period imposed on him is excessive. The ratio of the non – parole period to the aggregate head sentence is 77.78% (round figures).13 It is submitted that her Honour erred in setting the non – parole period at such a percentage of the head sentence. The applicant referred to authorities which indicate that the norm for non – parole periods is in the range of about 60 to 66 percent of the head sentence; (see for example: Bernier (1998) 102 A Crim R 44 at 49 and Behar (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, No 60363 of 1998, 14 October 1998). 14 The determination of the appropriate non – parole period for offences in breach of the criminal law of the Commonwealth involves the exercise of judicial discretion. As was observed by Meagher JA with whom Wood CJ at CL and Studdert J agreed in R v John Viana [2001] NSW CCA 171 [at 3]: 
     
      
      “The principles of law applicable in this area have been laid down by this court in  
      Bernier v R 
       (1998) 102 A Crim R 44. There is in fact no statute which requires the non – parole period to bear any particular proportion in relation to the head sentence, nor is there any mandatory precedent in this Court which requires a fixed sentence. The most that can be said is that this Court has usually in cases of this sort, thought the proportion ought to be somewhere between 60 and 66 per cent. That is not to say that higher percentages cannot stand”. 
      
    15 Factors identified as material to the determination of the appropriate ratio for a non – parole period include the length of the head sentence and its position in the permissible range: ( see Bernier (at 49) and Sweet 125 A Crim R 341 [at 346]), the seriousness of the offence and the prospects of rehabilitation (see Stitt (1998) 102 A Crim R 428 and Meloh [2001] NSW CCA 211 at [10] and the need to ensure that the sentence reflects the criminality involved and does not lose the important significant effect of general deterrence (see Drazkiewicz, unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW 23 November 1993). 16 The need for general deterrence for social security fraud has been emphasised over the years by judgments of this Court (see for example Regina v Mears (1991) 53 A Crim R 141, Regina v Purdon, 27 March 1997 unreported.)17 The applicant between August 1992 and May 2004 fraudulently obtained financial benefits from the Commonwealth in the sum of $309,351. Five false names were used, false documents were produced, bank accounts were opened and changes of address were given to the Department of Social Security . The offences were discovered only when a computer selection exercise was carried out by Centrelink. At the time of his arrest, the applicant was receiving Commonwealth benefits to which he was not entitled in three false names.18 Her Honour described the offences of “considerable objective gravity” and was satisfied “this was a relatively sophisticated series of crimes”. Her Honour found the offences were committed “because the offender was greedy”.19 Whilst her Honour did not make a specific finding of the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation, her Honour noted that the maker of the pre-sentence report “was not overly optimistic about his prospects for rehabilitation.”20 Due weight was given to the applicant’s plea of guilty and subjective circumstances. Her Honour regarded the applicant’s preparedness to sell properties as being co-operation or an expression of willingness to repay the monies dishonestly obtained. 21 No reasons were provided by her Honour, an experienced sentencing Judge, for determining the high proportion that the non – parole period bears to the aggregate head sentence. The failure however of an experienced sentencing Judge to mention such a matter is not conclusive of a failure to have regard to it: see R v Carr (2002) 135 A Crim R 171 at [34], R v Price [2004] NSW CCA 186 at [29].22 The applicants criminality was, in my view, of a high degree involving over eleven years of planned dishonesty. His fraudulent activity escaped detection over many years and a large sum of Commonwealth money to which he was not entitled was obtained. The aggregate effective head sentence after allowing for the plea of guilty and the subjective circumstances of the applicant was not at the upper level of the appropriate range.23 The non – parole period of 3 years and 6 months appropriately reflects the seriousness of the applicant’s criminality and meets the need for general deterrence. 24 I am not persuaded in the present case, notwithstanding the high percentage, that the non-parole period is such as ought to attract the intervention of this Court.25 The Court, in my view, should not form as required by section 6 (3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 an opinion that “some other sentence……..is warranted in law and should have been passed.”26 For these reasons, I would grant leave to appeal but would dismiss the appeal.

    2 The sentencing hearing occupied more than the usual period. There was a concern to ensure that his Honour was informed of the circumstances of the offences and also the personal circumstances of the respondent and her family. 
     
      
    3 His Honour determined, having regard to all of those matters, that the respondent should be sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment: 
     
      
       
      1. Section 29B offences (counts one and two) 6 months imprisonment); 
       
       
      2. Section 29D (counts three and four) 3 years imprisonment; 
       
       
      3. Section 135, the 15 offences, (counts 5, 6 and 7) one and a half years imprisonment. 
       
      
    4 His Honour suspended the sentences and directed that the respondent be released forthwith upon entering into a recognisance, ordered that he be of good behaviour for three years with self surety of $1000, pursuant to s 21B of the Crimes Act (Cth) 1914. The sentencing judge also made a reparation order in the terms sought by the Commonwealth. 
     
      
    5 The Crown appealed his Honour's decision in relation to the various sentences. The fundamental submission was that his Honour erred in suspending the sentences. It was submitted that for crimes of this nature a term of full-time imprisonment is the only appropriate sentence in almost every case. 
     
      
    6 The sentencing judge was significantly influenced in the sentences which he imposed by the fact that, although the respondent had committed, and repeated her crimes, over a period of 30 years, and had in that time taken in excess of $90,000 from the Commonwealth, nevertheless her age, which is now almost 84 years, and serious health issues, were such that His Honour did not believe it would be just to impose a term of full-time custody. 
     
      
    7 For the hearing of this appeal the Crown has provided the Court with detailed and helpful submissions. The respondent has also provided the Court with assistance through a written document. It is unnecessary for me to rehearse what each of the parties have said. The respondent concedes that in relation to offences of this nature the almost inevitable sentence should be one of full-time custody. That must be right and there are a number of decisions of this Court to that effect where a person sets out to defraud the Commonwealth by falsely swearing in relation to declarations which found a social security payment. This Court views the criminality involved as serious, justifying a term of imprisonment in almost every case. Indeed, if the respondent had been sentenced at first instance it may be that other judges would have formed the view that a term of full-time custody was appropriate and almost inevitable notwithstanding her personal circumstances. 
     
      
    8 However, this is a Crown appeal. The principles by which this Court approaches Crown appeals have often been repeated. Acknowledging that the criminality in this case may have required a full-time term of custody, I am of the opinion that, having regard to the personal circumstances of the respondent, and the principles referred to as double jeopardy, it would not be just for this Court now to revisit the sentence and provide for a period of incarceration. In so concluding, I should not be misunderstood as concluding that the sentences which were imposed were free of error. However the personal circumstances are so significant that in my view the only course is to dismiss the Crown appeal.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal pursuant to s 5AF of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 in relation to sentences imposed in the Drug Court. The Chief Justice, exercising the relevant statutory power, has directed that I, as a single judge of the Court, determine the appeal. 
     
      
    2 On 21 October 2005, the appellant was sentenced at Liverpool Local Court for two offences of drive whilst disqualified. In relation to the first offence committed on 30 September 2004, the appellant was sentenced to 6 months imprisonment suspended pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    3 In relation to the second matter committed on 2 October 2004, the appellant was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 9 months pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    4 On 4 November 2005, the appellant arranged to sell heroin to an undercover police officer. The heroin was said to be worth $50. Arrangements were made over the telephone for the appellant to meet with the operative. As arranged the appellant entered a vehicle and was given $50 in exchange for a silver foil containing .2 grams of heroin. Whether, in fact, there was .2 grams of heroin in the foil is unclear. It may be that the .2 includes the weight of the foil itself. In any event, it is apparent that the transaction involved a single heroin dose. 
     
      
    5 The appellant later gave the money that he obtained to an associate. Thereafter both were arrested and the appellant was found to be in possession of .4 grams of heroin as well as a plastic spoon with burn marks on the bottom. Upon arrest he made admissions in relation to arranging the drug transactions, supplying the heroin and being in possession of further heroin upon arrest. The appellant was charged with supply prohibited drug contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, and possession of a prohibited drug contrary to s 10 of that Act.  
     
      
    6 He was refused bail. Thereafter, he was allowed entry into the drug court program. Because of the fact that he had breached the two suspended sentences imposed 2 weeks earlier, by committing the further drug offences, the breach of bond traffic matters were also referred to the Drug Court to be dealt with pursuant to s 8AA of the Drug Court Act 1998 as it then was. 
     
      
    7 On 2 December 2005, Judge Barnett of the Drug Court imposed initial sentences on the appellant. In relation to the breach of bond traffic matters, he was sentenced to 6 months imprisonment and 12 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 9 months respectively. These were the terms previously set, and His Honour was obliged to revoke the bond and impose such conditions, the breach not being a trivial one. The sentences were directed to be served concurrently. 
     
      
    8 In relation to supplying a prohibited drug, the appellant was sentenced to 8 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 months. For possessing a prohibited drug, he was sentenced to a fixed term of 1 month imprisonment. The sentences of both drug offences were to be served concurrently but consecutively upon the separate breach of bond matters. The sentences were suspended upon the appellant's entry into the Drug Program. 
     
      
    9 The appellant was released from custody having been in custody since 4 November 2005. The appellant participated in the program with limited success, serving 49 days and a further 7 days on consensual sanctions. His participation was then terminated due to non compliance and he was refused bail. 
     
      
    10 He was sentenced on 17 July 2006. The initial sentences imposed for the breach of bond matters remained unchanged, namely concurrent terms of 6 months imprisonment and 12 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 9 months respectively. Taking into account his limited efforts in the Drug Court Program and time in custody and on remand, the sentences were backdated to 1 April 2006. 
     
      
    11 In relation to supplying a prohibited drug, his Honour departed from and reduced the initial sentence. He sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for 7 months with a non-parole period of 2 months consecutive upon the breach of bond traffic matters. The fixed term of 1 month imprisonment for possession of a prohibited drug remained unchanged and was also made to date from the expiry date for the breach of bond matters. 
     
      
    12 The sentence which his Honour imposed in relation to the supply matter was provided to commence on 1 January 2007 with the consequence that for a 3 month period it was made concurrent with the sentence which his Honour imposed in relation to the second count of the driving offence matters. As a consequence, the overall effective sentence which his Honour imposed was one of 16 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 11 months. 
     
      
    13 The appellant is now entitled to be released on parole on 28 February 2007. The ground of appeal advanced is that the sentence for the supply of prohibited drug was manifestly excessive. Although no complaint was originally made about the non-parole period, the submissions being confined to complaint about the term of the overall sentence. I understand that it is now submitted that, having regard to the volume of heroin supplied, a prison sentence may not have been appropriate. If it was, it is submitted that it should now be brought to an end.  
     
      
    14 When sentencing the appellant, the sentencing judge made it plain that in relation to the supply matter, it was important to mark out an effective parole period and also an overall term which would provide both punishment for the offence committed and also ensure that an effective message was sent to those who might consider undertaking similar offences. 
     
      
    15 In my opinion, his Honour had appropriate regard to the matters which could be found in the appellant's favour together with matters which were adverse. Although the Court was dealing with a small quantity of heroin, and it may have been in some circumstances that a lesser sentence could have been imposed, in my opinion, having regard to all of the circumstances, the sentence which his Honour determined to impose following the appellant's failure in the Drug Court Program could not be said to be excessive. It is to be hoped that the sentence has operated as a firm reminder to the appellant of the serious nature of the offences which he had committed. 
     
      
    16 In my view, the appeal must fail and is accordingly dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: We have come to the view that the evidence should not be admitted, and I will give brief reasons to you. Those reasons may or may not be expanded in the final judgment in the case.  
     
      
    2 The respondent seeks to read the affidavits in this Crown Appeal, namely an affidavit by the respondent himself dated 29 May 2007, and an affidavit by a legal advisor annexing a medical report, being an affidavit dated 3 October 2007.  
     
      
    3 The difficulty with the application is that the matter dealt with in this evidence is something that occurred prior to the original sentencing process. It is a matter that the respondent discussed with legal advisors and instructed them not to rely on in the sentencing process. That circumstance raises a difficulty for the application, and assimilates this case somewhat to a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Deng [2007] NSWCCA 216. There is a possible distinction from that case in that in Deng it appears that the material was not put forward at the sentencing process by reason of a tactical decision made by lawyers.  
     
      
    4 However, it does seem to me that the circumstance that the matter arose before sentence, and was discussed with legal advisors, does prevent this material satisfying the ordinary requirements for fresh evidence admissible on an appeal.  
     
      
    5 In my view, there may be occasions where evidence that does not satisfy those requirements may be admitted, if the requirements of justice strongly support the admission. However, I don't think the circumstances of this case would be sufficient to justify a conclusion that there are strong considerations that would override the normal requirements for fresh evidence. Much of the weight of the circumstances sought to be led, it appears, was taken into account by the sentencing judge when he took into account a medical condition of the respondent, and his vulnerability in custody. I would add that the particular circumstances alleged would be matters strongly disputed by the Crown in any event.  
     
      
    6 Taking all these matters into account my view is that a case is not made out for the admission of this evidence.  
     
      
    7 HISLOP J: I agree. 
     
      
    8 LATHAM J: I also agree.

     MARLIN, David John v R 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant, David John Marlin, pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61J(1) Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for this offence is 20 years imprisonment and the standard non-parole period which applies is 10 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    2 The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 30 September 2005 and expiring on 29 September 2008 with a balance of term of 2 years expiring on 29 September 2010. Accordingly, his total sentence is a term of 5 years commencing on 3 September 2005 and expiring on 29 September 2010. 
     
      
    3 The sentencing judge provided a 20% discount for the utilitarian value of the applicant’s plea. Her Honour was also satisfied that the applicant was contrite. The sentencing judge also made a finding of special circumstances having regard to the fact that it would be the applicant’s first time in custody, his age and his numerous physical and psychological problems and depression making his time in custody more onerous; his positive response to supervision in the past; and his need for supervision and psychological intervention. 
     
      
    4 The applicant seeks leave to appeal against his sentence. He is not represented but has provided written submissions and has this morning addressed the Court. 
     
      
    5 The grounds which the applicant seeks to press in the appeal are twofold. They relate to his apparent inability to attend the CUBIT Sex Offender’s Program in prison and his deteriorating health whilst in custody. 
     
      
    6 In his letter dated 15 December 2006 the applicant states that he has been informed by a female psychologist that he might not have access to the CUBIT Program due to lengthy waiting lists. Because the applicant has been convicted of a sexual offence, it is possible that unless he can satisfactorily complete the CUBIT Program he may not be able to obtain release on parole at the earliest possible date. I understand that he is eligible for the Program and will be able to apply for admission to it once this application has been determined. His admission to the program and his ultimate completion of it are, of course, matters for the Department of Corrective Services and are not matters for this Court. 
     
      
    7 I am satisfied that the applicant’s concerns about his capacity to enter the CUBIT Program is genuine. Whether they are justified is another matter. There is evidence before this Court which suggests that upon determination of this application the applicant may be able to enter the CUBIT Program thereby relieving his present concerns. In any event, as I have indicated, these concerns cannot provide a basis for this Court to review the sentence imposed on him.  
     
      
    8 The second matter is an apparent deterioration in the applicant’s medical condition. Evidence has been provided to this Court which suggests that he has cardio vascular problems and may have had minor coronary events. It would appear that each of these events have been appropriately dealt with through the medical facilities available to prisoners and if further medical intervention is required it will also be provided. 
     
      
    9 This Court said in R v Burrell (2000) 114 A Crim R 207 that the health of an offender may be a factor which bears upon the length and type of sentence when that sentence is being imposed. If a latent condition not detected at the time of sentence ultimately materialises this Court may, depending on all the circumstances, review the offender’s sentence: Iglesias v R [2006] NSWCCA 261. However, there is nothing in the present case to suggest that the health problems which the applicant has recently experienced are of a kind which would justify the intervention of this Court.  
     
      
    10 Although in my opinion leave to appeal should be granted, the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    11 BARR J: I agree. 
     
      
    12 HOEBEN J: I agree. 
     
      
    13 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The orders of the court are as I have indicated.

     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: I will ask Grove J to deliver the first judgment. 
     
      
    2 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Sweeney DCJ at Sydney District Court. The applicant, having pleaded guilty before the Local Court, appeared for sentence on offences of breaking, entering and stealing and robbery contrary to ss 112(1) and 94 of the Crimes Act respectively. Each of these offences has a prescribed maximum penalty of fourteen years imprisonment. Her Honour was also asked to take into account on Form 1 offences of using offensive language in a public place and assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty. 
     
      
    3 It is convenient to turn first to some background and facts relating to the offences. On 5 June 2004 residents of premises in Paddington departed for the day and when they returned found that the front door had been forced open. Inspection revealed that property had been removed from cupboards and the premises were in disarray. It was determined that a large number of items including jewellery and electrical items were missing. The property was not independently valued but the owners estimated their loss at something over $17,000. 
     
      
    4 On that evening the applicant was arrested in Kings Cross and was found to be in possession of some of the jewellery taken from the Paddington premises. He was charged with stealing that property and subsequently sentenced to imprisonment for six months. The amount of jewellery in his possession was recovered.  
     
      
    5 Part of the investigation into the break into the premises included taking a sample for DNA testing from a drink bottle which had been disturbed during the intrusion. DNA testing identified the applicant and he was arrested and charged with the offence of breaking, entering and stealing on 23 October 2005. By that time he had served the sentence of six months for stealing that amount of the jewellery which had been found in his possession in June 2004.  
     
      
    6 The offence of robbery occurred on 7 May 2006. A young man aged nineteen was walking in William Street, Kings Cross, attempting to make a telephone call from his mobile phone. This was unsuccessful as his phone had run out of credit and he approached the applicant seeking directions to a public telephone. The applicant threatened the victim with his fist and demanded the mobile phone. This demand was refused and they struggled and the applicant obtained possession of the item and made off. Later that day the victim, who was with a companion, saw the applicant and demanded the return of the phone. This approach was terminated when a female passer-by, no doubt unaware of the situation, told the victim and his friend to leave the applicant alone. The matter was reported to police and later that day the applicant was arrested. He was at the time, still in possession of the mobile phone.  
     
      
    7 After arrest the applicant was taken to a hospital to be treated for some unrelated injuries and whilst there he commenced repeatedly using loud and vulgar language, despite requests by police and hospital staff for him to desist. In the course of this conduct, whilst the police officer was attempting to calm him, he assaulted the police officer by spitting in his face. The matters on the Form 1 reflect these events. I note in passing, that the Form 1 incorrectly states the dates of these offences as 7 May 2005, rather than 7 May 2006.  
     
      
    8 The applicant had pleaded guilty in the Local Court to the offence of breaking, entering and stealing, and was awaiting sentence in the District Court when he was arrested for the robbery on 7 May 2006. He remained in custody continuously after that date. Consequent upon his plea of guilty to the offence of robbery, the matters were listed to be dealt with together.  
     
      
    9 Recognizing the pleas of guilty at the earliest opportunity, her Honour stated that she would accord the applicant a discount of 25 percent which she described as “the maximum discount ….for that early plea of guilty” for the offence of breaking, entering and stealing, and that again the applicant was entitled to “the maximum discount” for the early plea of guilty to the offence of robbery. These would appear to be references to the quantification of the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty in the guideline judgment R v Thomson & anor (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at p 419. That decision offered guidance and did not purport to legislate a “maximum” and it is important that this be fully understood. Her Honour imposed sentence for the robbery first, and, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, sentenced the applicant to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of three years commencing on 7 May 2006, with a balance term of one year, and for the offence of breaking, entering and stealing, to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of three years commencing on 7 May 2007 and expiring on 6 May 2010 with a balance term of two years. The overall effect of those sentences was to create a term of custody of four years before eligibility for parole on 6 May 2010 with a balance term of two years. 
     
      
    10 The applicant is thirty years of age. He was raised by his mother following the separation of his parents, but developed a reasonable relationship with a stepfather. He did not complete Year 10 at school and did not attain any formal educational qualifications. He has only ever worked in employment in low skilled occupations. He has a considerable prior record commencing, as an adult, with a conviction for stealing in 1994. Significantly, in 1997 he was sentenced to community service for an offence of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon, but an appeal to this Court saw the substitution of a sentence consisting of a minimum term of one year nine months and an additional term of two years. He was again imprisoned for robbery by sentence of the District Court in 1999. It is disturbing to note that he has several convictions concerning custody or carrying knives or cutting weapons. At the time of the commission of these offences he was on conditional liberty by reason of grants of bail and there were in existence warrants for his arrest by reason of failures to appear in court when required. 
     
      
    11 At the age of sixteen he had formed a relationship with a girl of which there is a stepdaughter now aged sixteen and a son aged twelve, with neither of whom he has had contact for approximately eight years. Whilst the applicant was in prison his partner passed away as a result of a drug overdose. He was not permitted to attend her funeral. This loss appears to have had a considerable impact upon the applicant.  
     
      
    12 Since his mid-teens the applicant has used alcohol and drugs and he became addicted to the use of heroin. He had made attempts to deal with this by entering a methadone program but relapsed into drug use. He had began to use an amphetamine commonly known as “ice”.  
     
      
    13 Her Honour was supplied with a detailed report by Dr Bruce Westmore, a psychiatrist, who made a provisional diagnosis of drug induced psychosis. Dr Westmore thought it was probable that when the robbery occurred the applicant was paranoid and probably having auditory perceptual disturbances as a result of drug use.  
     
      
    14 It was pointed out to her Honour that, for his various offences, the applicant had spent two-thirds of the last nine years in custody and it was submitted that he was at risk of becoming institutionalized. He gave evidence to her Honour that he wished to take the opportunity of treatment that may be available for mental health and drug rehabilitation. Dr Westmore considered that the applicant required extended community based drug rehabilitation services. 
     
      
    15 The initial submission on behalf of the applicant was that her Honour erred in not taking into account that the applicant had served six months imprisonment for stealing part of the loot taken in the breaking, entering and stealing at Paddington. Her Honour was aware of that history and in her remarks referred to the applicant’s arrest for being in possession of that property, although she did not specifically refer to the sentence imposed upon him for stealing. The Crown pointed out that the charge of breaking, entering and stealing did not particularize those goods which had been recovered when the applicant was arrested in June 2004, so that there was no duplication in the charge. The Crown further points out that these six months which the applicant served for stealing was served concurrently with sentences for other offences and also, in part, with the service of a balance of parole which had been revoked.  
     
      
    16 The Crown submission is, therefore, that there was no meaningful sentence imposed for the offence of stealing. The submission by the applicant is that there is an appearance, and a reality, of double punishment, a consequence which should be avoided in accordance with the principles delineated in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. 
     
      
    17 As far as the offence of breaking, entering and stealing omitted particulars of the goods which had been recovered at the time of the earlier arrest, there was no reality of double punishment. Whether there is an appearance of double punishment very much depends upon the point of view which is adopted. Although her Honour was clearly conscious of the circumstances of the earlier arrest, her remarks do not reveal one way or the other, whether she made or declined to make any adjustment for the service of imprisonment for the earlier offence.  
     
      
    18 It is submitted by the applicant that the sentence is manifestly excessive in all the circumstances. Her Honour did not express the total term which she had assessed prior to applying the 25 percent discount, which she had indicated. Arithmetically, it can be calculated that the starting point before such a discount must have been six years and eight months and five years and three months respectively.  
     
      
    19 The learned sentencing judge had observed that the applicant was being detained on protection in a psychiatric care unit and this placed him under restrictive conditions in his custody. She acknowledged the long term drug problem and his expressions of wishes to rehabilitate. Her Honour assessed the robbery offence as being, at what she described as “medium end of the low to medium spectrum of robberies”.  
     
      
    20 There can be no doubt of the correctness of her Honour’s conclusion that there needed to be some element of cumulation of the sentences for the separate offences. However, given the absence of expression concerning the initial assessment prior to application of the discount for pleas of guilty and whether the service of six months for an offence, which, at the very least was associated with the breaking, entering and stealing and in the light of the overall effective sentence for these offences as finally determined, I have come to the conclusion that the applicant has made good his claim for intervention by this Court.  
     
      
    21 I propose that the sentences in the District Court be quashed and the applicant be resentenced by this Court. For the reasons given by her Honour, which I would respectfully adopt, I agree that there should be a finding of special circumstances so that the balance period of imprisonment during which the applicant may be released to parole exceeds one-third of the non-parole period. I note the comment in the letter by Mr Noonan, the alcohol and other drug counsellor at the Metropolitan Programs Centre of the Department of Corrective Services: 
     
      
       
        
        “Throughout his incarceration, Mr Dominey has made every effort to address his offending behaviour and I expect him to continue to participate in counselling and programs, (when he can access them), both in custody and in the community.” 
        
       
      
    22 For the offence of robbery I would assess a total sentence of five years which I would reduce to three years nine months to recognize the plea of guilty. 
     
      
    23 For the offence of breaking, entering and stealing, I would assess a total sentence of six years reduced to four years six months to recognize the plea of guilty for that offence. 
     
      
    24 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
       
      1. Application for leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
       
      2. Appeal allowed and sentences in the District Court quashed. 
       
      3. In lieu thereof, the applicant sentenced as follows: 
       
      4. (a) On count 2 (robbery), taking into account the matters on Form 1, to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of two years six months to commence on 7 May 2006 and to expire on 6 November 2008 with a balance term of one year and three months; 
       
        
        (b) On count 1 (breaking, entering and stealing), to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of two years six months to commence on 7 May 2007 and to expire on 6 November 2009 with a balance term of two years to commence on 7 November 2009. 
        
       
      5. The earliest date of eligibility for parole specified as 6 November 2009. 
       
      
    25 BEAZLEY JA: I agree. 
     
      
    26 SIMPSON J: I also agree. 
     
      
    27 BEAZLEY JA: The orders of the Court are those proposed by Grove J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HOWIE J: The applicant is unrepresented before this Court. He seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him in the District Court by McGuire DCJ (the Judge). On 29 July 2005, the applicant was sentenced for two offences of sexual intercourse without consent of a child under the age of 16 years. The complainant in each case was his stepdaughter aged respectively 12 and 13 at the time of the offences. The first offence was committed between January and April 1992 and the second between February and July 1992. 
     
      
    2 The applicant today raised questions about the sentences imposed by his Honour, their correctness at the time of being pronounced and recorded on the indictment in the District Court and how those sentences were conveyed to the Department of Corrections by warrant. I will deal with these matters shortly. It is enough to say that, although there seems to have been some unfortunate errors in the recording of his Honour's sentences and in having those sentences conveyed to the Department of Corrections, there is no error in the pronouncement of the sentences apart from a technicality to which I shall refer shortly. 
     
      
    3 In respect of the first offence, the applicant was sentenced by his Honour to a term of imprisonment comprised of a non-parole period of 4 years with a balance of term of 2 years to date from 29 July 2005. In respect of the second offence, he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 3 years with a balance of term of 3 years to date from 29 July 2007. This is an overall sentence of 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years to expire on 28 July 2010, the date upon which the applicant is eligible to be released to parole. This is the way in which the sentences were pronounced by his Honour.  
     
      
    4 There is an error in the way those sentences were recorded on the indictment in the District Court. Further, the sentences as pronounced do not accord with section 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as it applied at the date of the commission of the offences. The sentences were pronounced in accordance with that section as it was at the time of sentence. However, this is a technical defect in the pronouncement of the sentences. It does not indicate that his Honour's discretion miscarried and it does not itself enliven the jurisdiction of this Court to interfere with the sentences imposed by his Honour. However, it will require the Court to re-sentence the applicant in order to comply with the relevant statutory requirements. 
     
      
    5 One matter raised by the applicant during his oral submissions to the Court today was the fact that he had been led to believe, during the course of his sentences when he applied to be transferred to Queensland, that he was serving a sentence of 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years. That was the sentence that was set out on the warrant dated 29 July 2005. That warrant contains a reference to only one offence, being the first offence for which the applicant was sentenced. The sentence as set out in that warrant was incorrect as it indicated that the term of the sentence was 4 years and the non-parole period was 2 years.  
     
      
    6 Although there was some confusion in the pronouncement of the sentence by his Honour by his use on two occasions in relation to that offence of the term “non-parole period”, it is clear that what his Honour intended was that there would be a non-parole period of 4 years in respect of that sentence with a balance of term of 2 years. 
     
      
    7 It is unexplained how it was that only one of the offences for which the applicant was sentenced came to be on the warrant of commitment and how it was that the sentence in respect of that offence was misstated. However, the terms of the warrant cannot, in my view, determine the outcome of this appeal.  
     
      
    8 Because of the confusion or apparent confusion as to the sentences that were imposed upon the applicant, the matter was brought back before his Honour on 4 May 2006. On that date, the Judge made it clear that he had intended, in respect of the first offence, to fix a non-parole period of 4 years with a balance of term of 2 years. His Honour also made it clear on that day, although it was unnecessary to do so, that in relation to the second count, the applicant had been sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 3 years with a balance of term of 3 years, that sentence to commence during the course of the term for sentence in the way I have already indicated. 
     
      
    9 It is unfortunate that, at one stage during the course of his sentence of imprisonment, the applicant was misled as to the sentence which he was serving, but, again, that does not seem to me to be a matter that could determine the outcome of this application. 
     
      
    10 Before his Honour there was a statement of facts in evidence. The complainant was born on 2 April 1979. The applicant married her mother in 1991 when he was aged 47 years. The facts describe a course of sexual misconduct by the applicant against the complainant in 1990 when she was aged 11 during which he would regularly come to her bedroom and fondle her breasts and place his fingers in her vagina. The first count relates to an act of penile/vaginal intercourse that occurred after the applicant had got into bed with the complainant and pulled down her panties. According to the facts, the complainant was crying continuously and the applicant withdrew after a few minutes without ejaculation. The second offence occurred about a month later. Again, the applicant had got into bed with the child and placed his penis in her vagina. He withdrew after a couple of minutes and ejaculated on her stomach. He attempted to put his penis into her mouth but she refused to allow him to do so. The facts state that sexual activity against the complainant continued until 1998. 
     
      
    11 In January 1998, the complainant provided a statement to police outlining her allegations of offences committed by the applicant in both this State and in Queensland. The applicant was spoken to later that month and conceded that the allegations were true. He acknowledged having intercourse with the child when she was aged between 12 and 13. When asked by police why he did so, he answered: ""Just for the sexual pleasure of it, I guess"". 
     
      
    12 The applicant was arrested and in December 1999 appeared in the District Court of Queensland. He pleaded guilty to two counts of indecent assault and one count of indecent treatment of a child under the age of 16 years. The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 12 months, which term was to be suspended after he served 4 months. 
     
      
    13 On 23 March 2000, the complainant's mother informed the police that the child no longer wished to continue with the complaints. According to material before his Honour, this statement was made without authority from, or to the knowledge of, the child. Before us the applicant has stated that he believes that that statement was made at the child's behest because the complainant was at that time living with, and under the care and control of, the mother. On 8 August 2002, however, the complainant made a further statement to police. The applicant was then interviewed on 27 March 2003 but refused to comment on the further allegations. Proceedings were commenced for these matters on 16 June 2004 and the applicant was committed for trial on 19 October 2004. He pleaded guilty to the two offences on 25 July 2005. 
     
      
    14 The transcript of the sentencing remarks of Judge Newton in the Queensland District Court was placed before the judge. It indicates that the offences dealt with in that court involved the digital penetration of the complainant when she was aged 14 and fondling her breasts when she was aged 18 and 19. 
     
      
    15 There was a psychological report before Judge McGuire dated 9 April 2005. The applicant was then aged 61 years. The applicant told the psychologist that the offences occurred when the complainant got into her parent's bed naked unbeknown to her mother who was also in the bed. He said that the complainant made her allegations known to her mother when he and the mother were considering being reunited after separating because of marital difficulties. The applicant said that he was raised in circumstances of poverty. He met the complainant's mother in 1989 and married her in 1991. This was the applicant's third marriage. In 2002 they renewed their wedding vows. He told the psychiatrist that their plans had been ""cut short"". 
     
      
    16 The applicant indicated to the psychologist that the child was provocative and very sexually aware at the time. However, he expressed remorse for his conduct and had an appreciation for the fact that he was an adult and responsible for his conduct. The psychologist thought that his developmental background had failed to provide him with the ""emotional skills and recourses necessary for a satisfying life"". She believed that he was a depressed and emotionally limited child and that his problems touched all aspects of his later life. His underlying problems remained throughout his marriages and that they ""set the scene"" for his sexual involvement with the complainant. His anxiety and depression were seen as pivotal problems in relation to his offending. 
     
      
    17 The psychologist believed that the applicant would benefit from psychological intervention to ""resocialise his attitudes and beliefs by addressing the problems of his childhood, youth and adulthood"". He needed to continue medication to address his anxiety and depressed states. The psychologist considered that he was unlikely to re-offend. 
     
      
    18 There was also in evidence a psychiatric report dated 21 April 1999. The report indicates that at that time the applicant was being treated for depression by medication and psychotherapy. The psychiatrist thought that the risk of repetition was minimal. There was also in evidence before his Honour testimonials from members of the community and other documents as to the applicant's behaviour in the community. 
     
      
    19 The Judge commented in his sentencing remarks upon the fact that he had heard no evidence from the applicant and had received no personal statements of remorse or contrition. He expressed scepticism of the expressions of remorse given to the psychologist and the account he had reported of the circumstances surrounding the offences. His Honour noted that the statement of facts referred to further offending after 1992 and he saw that fact as relevant to the lack of remorse by the applicant for his conduct in that he continued to molest the child for another 6 years after the offences for which he was being sentenced. 
     
      
    20 In particular, the Judge indicated that he was ""singularly unimpressed"" with the psychologist's explanation for the offending having regard to the whole of the applicant's conduct. His Honour was disbelieving that the child was provocative or sexually aware having regard to the material before him as to her behaviour when she was being assaulted. He thought the applicant was seeking to put blame on the child and that this was ""hardly consistent with genuine remorse or contrition and demonstrates lack of insight"". He thought that he simply used the child ""to satisfy his lust"". 
     
      
    21 The Judge referred to the history of the matter and the fact that the applicant had been sentenced in Queensland for indecent assault against the complainant. However, he referred to the maximum penalty for the offences before him, being imprisonment for 20 years, the seriousness of the activity contained in the counts to which the applicant had pleaded guilty and the need for general deterrence. The Judge indicated that he was prepared to consider the applicant as a person of good character at the time of the offending. He discounted the sentence by 25 per cent in recognition of the utilitarian value of the pleas. He noted the delay in the matters coming before the court and accepted that it would have subjected the applicant to anxiety and strain. He also said that he took into account that the offences occurred some 13 years before sentencing. 
     
      
    22 The Judge considered s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and found that it was an aggravating factor that the child was as young as 11 when the first offence was committed and hence particularly vulnerable. His Honour referred to a number of matters of mitigation, including the fact that the applicant was of good character and did not have a criminal record. He was not prepared to find that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend or had good prospects of rehabilitation in light of what the Judge saw as a lack of insight into his offending. The Judge found special circumstances by reason of the accumulation of sentences. In fact, the overall non-parole period is less than the statutory relationship of 75 per cent notwithstanding that the Judge gave no reasons to justify this outcome. 
     
      
    23 The applicant filed a document entitled ""Submissions"" and dated 22 August 2006. It contains the following: 
     
      
       
        
        If a court does not impose a sentence suited to the seriousness of the crime it fails to act as a deterrent to other offenders. 
        
       
       
        
        On the other hand, justice and humanity both require that the previous character and conduct and probable future life and conduct of the individual offender and the effect of the sentence on these should also be given careful consideration. 
        
       
      
    24 The applicant also filed what purported to be grounds of appeal. In effect, this document sets out the history of the proceedings from the complaints in 1999 through to the date of sentencing in July 2005. The applicant submitted that had the offences been dealt with at the appropriate time, presumably in 1999, ""it would all be over by now"". The applicant expressed the hope that the sentences would be served concurrently. He also stated that, contrary to the views expressed by the Judge, he had genuinely expressed his sorrow and regret for his actions and apologised to the complainant. 
     
      
    25 In oral submissions before us today, the applicant again stressed the time that had elapsed from 1998 in Queensland until these matters were proceeded against him in 2002. He also again stressed before us that he was contrite and had sent a letter to his daughter and wife apologising for his behaviour.  
     
      
    26 It is not unusual, unfortunately, that there is an extensive delay between the commission of child sexual offences and the finalisation of the charges by sentencing. This matter is, however, unusual in that there is a significant period of delay that, on the material before his Honour, was a result of the conduct of the wife rather than that of the complainant or the applicant. This delay was because the wife, in effect, withdrew the complaints, although she had no authority to do so. Even if it be accepted that the complainant at the time was not prepared to continue with the allegations that gave rise to these offences, it is still to be taken into account that the offences were extremely serious even though there was the further delay before the complainant changed her mind and decided to continue with her allegations against the applicant. There was also the unexplained delay between the making of the further statement by the complainant and the commencement of the proceedings by the New South Wales police. 
     
      
    27 The Judge stated that he was taking that delay and its possible effects upon the applicant into account. This was a case where the principles expounded in R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 applied to some extent, although it was not simply the operation of the legal system in different States that brought about the delay in the finalisation of the proceedings in this State. However, the offences before the Judge were very much more serious than those before the District Court in Queensland. They were offences of sexual impropriety of the utmost gravity involving as they did acts of non-consensual sexual intercourse of a young child by a stepfather. In my view, they required condign punishment notwithstanding the delay and its effects upon the applicant.  
     
      
    28 In my opinion, the Judge was completely justified in imposing partially cumulative sentences as the appropriate sentence for one of the offences could not comprehend the totality of criminality reflected by both. It would have been an error to impose totally concurrent sentences notwithstanding the delay. The applicant was given the benefit of a 25 per cent discount even though the pleas of guilty came after he was committed for trial. That was, on one view, a very generous approach. The applicant's good character and lack of criminal record was of little significance having regard to the fact that the offences were part of a course of criminal conduct that stretched over many years.  
     
      
    29 The Judge reduced the overall non-parole period to about 65 per cent of the total term because he found special circumstances by reason of the cumulation of sentences. However, finding special circumstances on that basis is usually only done where the Court is intending to retain the statutory relationship overall by reducing the non-parole period of the sentence being served cumulatively. There is no valid reason for finding special circumstances to reduce the overall non-parole period simply because sentences are to be served cumulatively. 
     
      
    30 Once the Judge found that he was not persuaded to accept the opinion of the psychologist because it was inconsistent with the facts upon which the applicant was being sentenced, it is difficult to see how a longer period on parole than would result from the statutory proportion could be justified. The Judge was entitled to form the view that the applicant was not truly contrite and lacked insight into his offending. 
     
      
    31 In light of those findings and being unpersuaded that there were good prospects of rehabilitation, it is difficult, in my view, to see why there should have been a finding of special circumstances to lessen the overall non-parole period. In my opinion, the Judge gave no adequate reason to justify reducing the overall non-parole period but this was an error in the applicant's favour. 
     
      
    32 The applicant must understand that this is a Court concerned with the correction of errors. It does not simply interfere with a sentence imposed because this Court might have imposed a different sentence. In my opinion, any error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion was in favour of the applicant and no lesser sentence is warranted. The overall sentence imposed was a long one but fully justified because of the offences committed by the applicant notwithstanding the delay before the sentences were imposed. 
     
      
    33 As I have already indicated, however, the actual pronouncement of the sentences was not in accordance with the statutory scheme that existed at the time that the offences were committed and applied in this particular case. As I have already indicated, it is a necessary consequence that this Court must re-sentence the applicant even though it has found no error was made in the exercise of discretion which would warrant the reduction of the sentences imposed. 
     
      
    34 For the purpose of correcting the pronouncement of the sentences, I would grant the applicant leave to appeal and allow the appeal. The sentences in each case are quashed. In lieu thereof, the sentence on the first count is one of imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years to date from 29 July 2005. The non-parole period is to expire on 28 July 2009. But for the sentence to be next pronounced, the applicant would be eligible to be released on that day. The sentence on the second count is one of imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years to commence on 29 July 2007, the date upon which the sentence commences and which is to expire on 28 July 2010, the date upon which the applicant is eligible to be released to parole. 
     
      
    35 The judge made certain recommendations which will be continued, that being that the applicant be afforded psychiatric and psychologist treatment in custody and he be supervised by the Probation and Parole Service whilst on parole and accept the directions in regard to ongoing psychological and psychiatric conditions.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Bell DCJ at Gosford District Court. The applicant pleaded guilty to supplying a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine) and was sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of fourteen months and a balance term of ten months. 
     
      
    2 At the commencement of his remarks his Honour recorded the Crown’s acceptance that the applicant’s involvement was at the lower end of the scale of seriousness for the offence. I would comment that his actions, which I will recount, were minimal and it is not difficult to perceive how he may have considered his actions defensible until appropriate legal advice was given to him and he offered the plea of guilty. 
     
      
    3 The applicant had a long term relationship with a Ms Shelley Ward and was the father of two of her children. As at the date of the offence (23 March 2005) Ms Ward resided at Narara and the applicant resided in Terrigal. He was at her house on the day taking a shower. Ms Ward’s brother Clinton telephoned her and said that one Dean Talbot would deliver something to her which he asked be brought to him. The applicant was told of the call when he emerged from the shower. Immediately thereafter Talbot arrived and handed the applicant an envelope. The applicant knew that the envelope contained drugs of some kind, in fact the content was two hundred and fifty four tablets of methylamphetamine.  
     
      
    4 Despite a suggestion from Clinton Ward that the envelope should be transported by being secreted in his sister’s underclothing, the applicant, in what his Honour said might in some circles be regarded as a chivalrous act, put the envelope in his own “bum bag”. The applicant, Ms Ward and two children set off on a journey with multiple intended destinations including delivery of the drug to Clinton Ward. Ms Ward was driving the vehicle.  
     
      
    5 Police were surveying the actions of Clinton Ward and Dean Talbot in particular, as well as lawfully intercepting and recording telephone conversations between them. They stopped the vehicle in which the applicant was riding and located the tablets. The applicant gave untrue responses to questions about the source of the drugs. However, his entire involvement was as above described, that is, taking possession of the drugs whilst Ms Ward provided transport to enable the drugs to be moved from her house to her brother. Whether this staggered delivery instead of Talbot taking the drugs directly to Clinton Ward was calculated to escape fears of surveillance by police is speculative. 
     
      
    6 The sole ground of appeal is in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance arising out of the disparity between the sentence he is serving and the sentences imposed upon his co-offenders, Clinton Ward and Dean Talbot.” 
        
       
      
    7 The principles to be applied when such a ground is advanced are well established (Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 and cases following it), and do not require recapitulation. 
     
      
    8 Analysis is complicated by the circumstance that both Clinton Ward and Dean Talbot were dealt with for multiple offences including involvement in the offence charged against the applicant, and it is appropriate to assume that considerations of totality would be reflected in the construct of sentences received by those offenders.  
     
      
    9 Clinton Ward pleaded guilty to three charges as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “i knowingly take part in the supply of a prohibited drug (1,381.5 grams of cannabis leaf) between 1 December 2004 and 26 May 2005; 
        
       
       
        
        ii knowingly take part in the supply of a prohibited drug (300 tablets containing methylamphetamine weighing 75 grams) between 1 December 2004 and 26 May 2005; and 
        
       
       
        
        iii knowingly take part in the supply of a prohibited drug (250 tablets containing methylamphetamine weighing 90.5 grams) on 23 March 2005.” 
        
       
      
    10 It is the third charge in which the applicant was also involved. Clinton Ward was sentenced by Andrew ADCJ to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of eighteen months with a balance term of six months for the first offence (cannabis) and for each of the second and third offences (methylamphetamine) to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of two years with a balance term of twelve months accumulated to the extent of twelve months on the firstmentioned sentence. The overall effect was an aggregate non-parole period of three years and a balance term of one year.  
     
      
    11 The remarks on sentence of Andrew ADCJ were placed before Bell DCJ when sentencing the applicant but he was not provided with the judgment of this Court when the sentences on Clinton Ward were varied resulting in the non-parole periods for the methylamphetamine offences being reduced to eighteen months but the balance terms extended to eighteen months. The consequent aggregate sentence became a non-parole period of two years and six months with a balance term of eighteen months. 
     
      
    12 Talbot pleaded guilty to seven charges, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        “i manufacture a prohibited drug (164 grams of methylamphetamine) between 30 November 2004 and 27 May 2005; 
        
       
       
        
        ii supply a prohibited drug (90.51 grams of methylamphetamine) on 23 March 2005; 
        
       
       
        
        iii supply a prohibited drug (112.5 grams of 3.4 methylenedioxy methylamphetamine) between 12 January 2005 and 27 May 2005; 
        
       
       
        
        iv supply a prohibited drug (98 grams of methylamphetamine) between 4 January 2005 and 27 May 2005; 
        
       
       
        
        v supply a prohibited drug (5,932 grams of cannabis) between 12 January 2005 and 27 May 2005; 
        
       
       
        
        vi supply a prohibited drug (14.19 grams of methylamphetamine) on 27 May 2005; 
        
       
       
        
        vii possess prescribed restricted substances (Kynoslene, Stanazol and Sustanon) on 27 May 2005.” 
        
       
      
    13 O’Connor DCJ, when sentencing Talbot was asked also to take into account five further offences on two separate Forms 1. He did so when imposing sentence for offences above numbered i and vi.  
     
      
    14 Talbot was sentenced as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “In respect of counts ii, iii, iv and vi, terms of imprisonment of 2 years commencing from 2 March 2007 and expiring on 1 March 2009. 
        
       
       
        
        In respect of count v, a term of imprisonment of 12 months commencing from 2 March 2007 and expiring on 1 March 2008.  
        
       
       
        
        In respect of count vii, a term of imprisonment of 9 months commencing from 2 March 2007 and expiring on 1 December 2007. 
        
       
       
        
        In respect of count i, imprisonment for a term comprised of a non-parole period of 2 years commencing from 2 September 2008 and expiring on 1 September 2010, and a balance of term of 2 years expiring on 1 September 2012.” 
        
       
      
    15 In each of the cases of Clinton Ward and Talbot the judge expressed himself as applying a 25 per cent “discount” for prompt plea of guilty. The applicant’s plea was not prompt and he was granted a 15 per cent “discount”. 
     
      
    16 The Crown Prosecutor has helpfully “back calculated” the terms for the methylamphetamine offences against those stated discounts. The notional starting sentences would therefore have been:  
     
      
      (a) for the applicant, total term 28.2 months, non-parole period 16.5 months; 
       
      (b) Clinton Ward, total term 4 years, non-parole period 2 years 8 months but, after appeal, total term 4 years, non-parole period 2 years and 
       
      (c) Talbot, fixed term 2 years 8 months. 
       
      
    17 It should be noted that Talbot had no criminal record. The applicant had such a record but his Honour found that “to his credit” he had not been involved in any offence since 2000 and he placed “small weight” on the record of previous convictions.  
     
      
    18 Andrew ADCJ found that Clinton Ward was part of an organized activity of drug supply in which he participated at a number of levels. He was involved in arranging to obtain drugs and paying for them and on-selling and collecting the proceeds of sale. He was involved in the offences for commercial gain as well as a need to feed his own habit. 
     
      
    19 O’Connor DCJ found that Talbot (and his brother who was also involved in offences with him) was at a higher level of criminality than Clinton Ward and that they were “middle level suppliers” involved in the manufacture and supply of drugs. Although those aspects were found, focus needs to remain on what Talbot was actually charged with. 
     
      
    20 Making every allowance for matters of discrimination I conclude that the applicant’s ground of appeal has been made good. My conclusion substantially is based upon the vast gap between the criminality observable in the activities of Clinton Ward and Talbot constituting their participation in the offence and the almost incidental part played by the applicant and I do not consider that the ultimate differences in the sentences sufficiently reflect the gap. That is not to trivialize the applicant’s voluntary participation in what he undoubtedly knew was drug supply. It is, however, significant that there was no suggestion that he was involved for any commercial gain and his participation emerged from his coincidental presence at Ms Shelley Ward’s house when Talbot made the delivery.  
     
      
    21 I propose the following: 
     
      
       
      (1) Application for leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
       
      (2) Appeal allowed and sentence imposed in the District Court quashed. 
       
      (3) In lieu thereof the applicant sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 10 months commencing on 20 February 2007 and expiring on 19 December 2007 with a balance term of 4 months. 
       
      (4) The applicant be ordered to release on parole on 19 December 2007. 
       
      
    22 SIMPSON J: I agree. 
     
      
    23 BARR J: I also agree. 
     
      
    24 GROVE J: The orders of the Court will be as I have proposed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: The Applicant was charged with an offence under s25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 that he did between 10 October 2002 and 20 December 2002 supply a prohibited drug, namely heroin. He pleaded not guilty. He was convicted after a nine day trial. He was sentenced by McGuire DCJ to imprisonment for 4 years and 10 months commencing 21 March 2005 with a non-parole period of 3 years and 4 months. 
     
      
    2 Together with a co-accused, Raymond Russell, the Applicant engaged in the supply and distribution of heroin in the Lake Macquarie and Newcastle areas over a period of time. Those activities included the supply of amounts to lower level dealers and also the supply of small amounts directly to users. The conduct of the operation over a significant period of time involved planning and co-ordination. Supply occurred on numerous occasions, which were the subject of direct evidence through police undercover operations. Nothing turns on the detail. However, his Honour’s conclusion, which was fully justified, was that this case involved: 
     
      
       
        
        “… a prolonged planned, pre-meditated and persistent course of drug dealing and in total they on sold a substantial quantity of drugs. They could be described as extremely active and successful midrange dealers, participating in a commercial enterprise.” 
        
       
      
    3 On the basic facts there was nothing to distinguish the Applicant’s involvement in the actual operation from that of his co-offender, Russell. However, Russell pleaded guilty and was sentenced by Puckeridge DCJ to a term of imprisonment of 3 years, less a period of 91 days pre-sentence custody. His Honour set a non-parole period of 2 years less the 91 days pre-sentence custody. 
     
      
    4 McGuire DCJ had the remarks on sentence of Puckeridge DCJ before him. His Honour took them into account on the issue of parity. 
     
      
    5 There are two grounds of appeal. First, his Honour failed to make proper allowance for parity and that, in the result, the Applicant has a legitimate sense of grievance. Secondly, that his Honour failed to take fully into account the pre-sentence custody of this Applicant, which, again, contrasted with the structure of the sentence imposed on the co-offender Russell. 
     
      
    6 It is convenient to deal with the second ground first. The Applicant was in custody, bail having been refused from his arrest on 19 December 2002 until 9 May 2003, with the effect that he served 142 days of pre-sentence custody. In his remarks on sentence McGuire DCJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In fixing sentence I have had regard to the period of approaching five months he spent in custody following his apprehension.” 
        
       
      
    7 Nevertheless, when imposing the non-parole period of 3 years 4 months, his Honour commenced the sentence on 20 March 2005, i.e. the day on which the Appellant was convicted and, one assumes, bail was revoked and he was returned to custody. There was no backdating of the sentence, unlike that which occurred in the case of the co-offender Russell. 
     
      
    8 In my opinion, his Honour’s reasons, that I have quoted, indicate that his Honour took the period of 5 months into account in determining the sentence he imposed. His Honour did not specify whether he deducted it from the non-parole period or from the parole period. This has that consequence that what appears to be a head sentence of 4 years and 10 months should be regarded as a sentence of 5 years and 3 months. That is the sentence that is appropriate to be taken into account, and contrasted with the period of 4 years and 8 months imposed on the co-offender on the parity ground of appeal. 
     
      
    9 There is no rule that a sentencing judge must take into account the period of pre-sentence custody by means of backdating the sentence, rather than by deducting the relevant period from the total sentence he proposes to impose. The important thing is that it be fully taken into account, and on the authorities in this Court, that it be demonstrated that it has been taken into account. 
     
      
    10 His Honour said that he did take it into account. In my opinion this Court should act on the basis that his Honour took it into account, as he said he would, by reducing the sentence he would otherwise have imposed. 
     
      
    11 The Applicant draws the Court’s attention to the judgment of this Court in R v Howard [2001] NSWCCA 309. In that case there were two periods of pre-sentence custody, one of which the sentencing judge referred to and the other of which the sentencing judge had said he had taken into account. In the judgment in this Court, Wood CJ at CL, with whom Beazley JA and Sperling J agreed, said 
     
      
       
        
        “[24] … His Honour made no mention of the first period of ten days, but expressly stated that he had taken into account the second period of one month and five days. It is, however, submitted that the sentence being expressed in round terms of seven years six months with a non parole period of five years six months, it did not demonstrate any such allowance, since one might reasonably have expected that it would either have been backdated, as is permissible … or to have been reduced at the other end. 
        
       
       
        
        [25] It is not clear why the two periods of pre-sentence custody were not demonstrably reflected in the sentencing order …” 
        
       
      
    12 There are two things to say about this passage relied upon by the Applicant. First, Wood CJ at CL indicates clearly that it was open to the Court to either backdate the sentence or to reduce the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed. Secondly, the relevant test is whether or not the pre-sentence in custody had been “demonstrably reflected in the sentencing order.” In that case the failure to backdate by an odd period of days, namely 1 month and 5 days for the second period and a period of 10 days for the first period, was such as to indicate that his Honour had failed to take the matter into account. 
     
      
    13 In the present case what his Honour did was in some respects, the obverse of what happened in Howard. Rather than rounding down the sentence to be imposed, what his Honour did, and said he was doing, was to round up the period of pre-sentence custody. As I have quoted above, his Honour said that the pre-sentence custody was a “period of approaching five months.” That was so. It was a period of 4 months and 22 days. His Honour rounded it up to 5 months.  
     
      
    14 Accordingly, the conclusion that was available in the case of Howard, that his Honour had not demonstrably reflected the pre-sentence custody in the sentence finally imposed, cannot be said to be true in this case. His Honour did some rounding it is true, but the rounding was favourable to the Applicant and is no basis for a complaint. Accordingly, in my opinion, this ground of appeal should be rejected. 
     
      
    15 By reason of the above analysis, the second ground of appeal, on the question of parity, has to be assessed on the basis that his Honour in fact imposed an effective sentence of 5 years and 3 months on the Applicant. 
     
      
    16 There was a material difference between the two co-offenders in that Russell pleaded guilty. Puckeridge DCJ commenced by identifying an appropriate head sentence of 4 years and 8 months imprisonment, from which he deducted 25 percent for the utilitarian value of the plea. This starting point of 4 years and 8 months contrasts with the starting point of, effectively, 5 years and 3 months in the case of the Applicant.  
     
      
    17 The issue before this Court is whether or not a differentiation of 7 months, with appropriate reflection in the non-parole periods, was open to his Honour in the exercise of the discretion within the application of the principle of parity. 
     
      
    18 McGuire DCJ compared the two offenders in the following passage: 
     
      
       
        
        “His co-offender Russell, with whom he was engaged in a joint criminal enterprise, pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity before Judge Puckeridge and was granted a twenty-five percent discount by reason thereof. The prisoner attracts no such consideration. 
        
       
       
        
        Russell’s record could be roughly equated with that of the prisoner albeit that it was lengthier and reflected sentences, imposed many years ago. Judge Puckeridge in fixing Russell’s sentence took into account that he was in protective custody in relation to an unrelated matter and that he would continue under protection. Apparently he assisted the Crown with regard to a prosecution for murder. His Honour also took into account matters on a form one, however, there is no such schedule in this matter.” 
        
       
      
    19 The submissions on behalf of the Applicant were that this 7 month difference in the starting point between the two sentences was inappropriate on parity grounds.  
     
      
    20 His Honour referred to three factors which differentiated the two cases. First, there were offences on the Form 1, in the case of Russell. This would suggest the difference should be less rather than more. The other two matters worked in the other direction. Second, was the protective custody in which Russell would have to spend his imprisonment and, third, was the assistance with regard to a prosecution for murder that Russell had given. 
     
      
    21 Mr Johnston, counsel for the Applicant, has submitted to the Court that the passage of his Honour’s reasons which I have quoted, and in which he refers to the assistance of the Crown, was mentioned by his Honour by way of explanation for why Russell has served his period in protective custody and would continue under protection. 
     
      
    22 This submission appears to me to have some force. On this basis, the critical differentiation is the protective custody in which Russell will have to spend the entire period of his imprisonment. In my opinion, this consideration does justify a difference of the order of magnitude of 7 months which McGuire DCJ determined to be appropriate in this case.  
     
      
    23 This is a Court of error. The issue for this Court is whether the particular factor which his Honour expressed to have taken into account, within the legitimate range of the exercise of sentencing discretion, justified the differentiation to which his Honour eventually came. In my opinion it was within that legitimate range. Accordingly, the ground of appeal based on parity considerations should be rejected. 
     
      
    24 The orders of the Court that I propose are that leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    25 SIMPSON J: I agree. 
     
      
    26 JOHNSON J:  I also agree. 
     
      
    27 SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders are as I have indicated.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HOWIE J: The applicant was sentenced in the District Court by Judge Walmsley SC (""the Judge"") for an offence of break, enter and stealing contrary to section 112(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 and an offence of not keeping ammunition safely contrary to section 40(1) of the Firearms Act 1996. In respect of the first offence, he was sentenced to a non-parole period of 15 months with a balance of term of one year to date from 9 June 2006. In respect of the ammunition offence he was sentenced to a fixed term of one month commencing on 9 June 2006. The applicant is to be released to parole on 8 September 2007. He seeks leave to appeal against those sentences. 
     
      
    2 As will be seen shortly the applicant confessed his criminal offending to police and pleaded guilty to both charges in the Local Court. He also gave assistance to the police by nominating his co-offender, by assisting in obtaining evidence against him and by undertaking to give evidence at his trial. As a result of the plea of guilty and the assistance given and offered the Judge reduced what he considered to be an otherwise appropriate sentence of six years to that which he imposed. This is a reduction in percentage terms of about 60 per cent for both the plea and assistance. The Judge did not indicate what proportion of the discount was for future assistance. 
     
      
    3 There are two grounds of appeal being, firstly, that the Judge failed to give appropriate weight to the assistance provided by the applicant and, secondly, that the sentence is manifestly excessive. In written submissions it was accepted that, on its face, the sentence was not manifestly excessive, but it was submitted that it became so when consideration was given to the assistance provided to police and other subjective circumstances of the applicant. The ultimate submission is that the Judge should have ordered that the sentence should be served by way of periodic detention.  
     
      
    4 In brief the facts are that the applicant and his co-offender, Rod Gonzales, stole a very large amount of money, $560,321.40 from the National Bank. They were able to enter and gain access to the bank's safe at the Marrickville branch using a key and access codes obtained by Gonzales because of his employment with a security firm, Brinks Security. The applicant also had some understanding of the bank security arrangements because of his previous occupation with a security firm. The original plan was that the applicant would enter the bank wearing a Brinks uniform, gain access to the safe and leave with the money. 
     
      
    5 On 4 April 2005 the applicant drove to Gonzales' home, purchased a wig, and returned to the house where the two dressed in Brinks uniforms. The applicant wrote the codes on his forearm and put the key in his pocket before they left the premises shortly before 6 pm. The applicant entered the bank and once inside found that the layout did not accord with the description provided by Gonzales. There was a door that he was unable to open and so he left the bank. Gonzales then entered the bank while the applicant waited outside. He accessed the night-safe by using the relevant codes and removed the money. 
     
      
    6 They returned home and split the money, the applicant receiving $180,000. He later disposed of the key and the bank bags. He purchased a BMW motor vehicle for $19,000 and also travelled to Lebanon with the proceeds of the theft. When he returned to Australia, Gonzales assured him that the police knew nothing. Police investigations had, by that time, failed to identify the persons who had committed the offence. 
     
      
    7 However, both the applicant and Gonzales had come under suspicion. On 8 December the applicant agreed to meet police in order to be served a summons to attend the New South Wales Crime Commission in relation to the offence. The applicant informed police that he wished to provide them with information and ultimately entered into a recorded interview. In January 2006 he made a statement to police admitting his involvement in the offence and nominating Gonzales as his co-offender. He agreed to assist police by wearing a listening device on one occasion when he spoke to Gonzales. 
     
      
    8 During a search of the applicant's premises the police discovered in the garage a large canvass bag that contained a large amount of ammunition for shotguns and rifles. This incident gave rise to the ammunition offence. 
     
      
    9 The applicant has no prior criminal record. He was born in Lebanon in October 1979 and came to Australia in 1990. He became an Australian citizen in 1995. His mother and siblings returned to Lebanon after the applicant's parents' marriage broke up. He maintains contact with his family in Lebanon and his father who resides in Australia. The applicant married in 1997 and has three children aged between six weeks and five years. At the time of the offence he was working as a sales manager for a telecommunications company and also cleans carpets. 
     
      
    10 The applicant told a psychologist, who prepared a report for the sentencing court, that he met Gonzales at a gym and learned of his criminal activities. He said that he was seduced by the chance of obtaining money to ease his financial pressures. He described feeling elevated levels of guilt, withdrawal, anxiety and depression following the offence. He expressed fears for himself and his family from Gonzales. There is nothing in the psychiatric report that impacted significantly on the task before the Judge. 
     
      
    11 The applicant gave evidence at the sentencing hearing. He said that he had met Gonzales while the applicant was working in the security industry. He stated that he knew he had large amounts of money and suspected he obtained it illegally. Gonzales asked the applicant if he wanted to become involved. He said that at the time he was under financial pressure: ""just paying bills on time and just the usual things that people have"". He said that he wanted to buy a new car for his wife. The applicant conceded in cross-examination that he had initiated discussions with Gonzales about obtaining money. He also conceded that there had been no threats made against him since he had spoken to Gonzales at the police behest. 
     
      
    12 The first ground of appeal asserts that the Judge failed to give full weight to the applicant's assistance. Reliance is placed on what is said to be a failure of the Judge to mention the fact that the applicant was to give evidence at the co-offender's trial, a failure to indicate that the applicant was to serve his sentence in harsher conditions and the danger to the applicant's family. Much weight is placed upon the confession made to police in circumstances where, although the police may have had suspicions about the applicant, they had no hard evidence against him.  
     
      
    13 In my opinion this ground has not been made out. It is not suggested that the starting sentence chosen by the Judge of six years was excessive, nor could it be. This was a planned offence involving the knowledge and expertise of both the applicant and the co-offender from their involvement in the security industry. It involved disguising themselves and entering the bank posing as security guards. The offenders intended to obtain a very large sum of money from the bank's safe and this is what occurred. It was clearly an offence of greed so far as the applicant was concerned. Large sums of money cannot be accounted for and are still outstanding. Of the $180,000 that the applicant said he received, he had at the time of sentence repaid $65,000. We have been informed today however, that the applicant has - or it has been paid on his behalf to the New South Wales Crime Commission, the amount of money that, according to the Crime Commission, is the value of the proceeds of the crime received by the applicant.  
     
      
    14 The applicant accepted that he voluntarily became involved in the theft and approached Gonzales to allow him to participate. The maximum penalty for the offence is 14 years and this is an instance of the offence being in the upper range of criminality. 
     
      
    15 As has already been pointed out, the applicant received a combined discount of about 60 per cent. In my opinion that was overly generous. The ultimate sentence of 15 months non-parole period is, in my view, inadequate as reflecting the objective seriousness of the offence. In my view the applicant is fortunate in the finding of special circumstances as the pre-sentence report indicated that there was nothing that required the attention of that service. The Judge found special circumstances existed by reason of the fact that it was his first time in custody and that the applicant will find prison more difficult as a result of informing on his co-offender. There was no evidence to support that finding if what his Honour meant was that the applicant was going to be subject to a more harsh prison regime. It has been held by this Court on more than one occasion that it should not be assumed that an informer will be subject to a harsher prison environment then other prisoners: R v Mostyn (2004) 145 A Crim R 304. 
     
      
    16 There is no evidence that Gonzales posed any particular danger to the applicant or his family. The threat made was general and, although Gonzales must be aware that the applicant is to give evidence against him, there is no suggestion that he has further threatened the applicant or his family. There was no evidence before his Honour and there is no evidence before this Court to suggest that the applicant would have to be placed in protection. In R v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92 it was held by McClelland CJ at CL and myself that it would be exceptional for a combined discount of more than 40 per cent to be granted where there was no evidence that the offender was going to be treated more harshly in custody. In the present case the Judge was entitled to give a more generous discount by reason of the applicant's voluntary confession, but a discount by almost two-thirds was unwarranted.  
     
      
    17 It follows that in my opinion both grounds of appeal cannot be made out. The sentence, as I've already indicated, was an extremely lenient one, there were arguably errors made by the Judge in the applicant's favour and any lesser sentence would be, in my view, inadequate to the point of error. The application should, therefore, be allowed but the appeal should be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Bishop DCJ at Penrith District Court. The appellant had pleaded guilty in the Local Court to a single count of indecent assault on a person under the age of ten years. His Honour’s imposition consisted of (as stated) imprisonment for four years and nine months with a non parole period of two years and nine months. In a written submission the Crown conceded “that the sentencing judge erred in determining the parole period that the appellant is to serve” and acknowledged that “the parole period will require adjustment.” Leave to appeal should be granted. 
     
      
    2 A statement of facts was tendered at the sentencing proceedings and there is no challenge to his Honour’s summary namely: 
     
      
       
        
        “The prisoner is the natural father of the victim who was nine years old at the time of the offence. She is one of four children of a ten year relationship between the prisoner and the mother of the victim. 
        
       
       
        
        On 29 February 2004 the prisoner came home at about 12.50am. His partner, the mother, was asleep on the lounge because she knew he had left the key behind and she would have to let him in. She did this and went back to sleep. She was woken by the sound of the radio and when she opened the closed door of the bedroom she shared with the prisoner she found the victim awake and naked on the bed with the prisoner sitting on the bed wearing only boxer shorts with his hand on the victim’s vagina. 
        
       
       
        
        The mother dressed the victim and left the home with her and the other children. There is no medical assessment of the victim who was said to be too upset. There is no evidence of any similar behaviour by the prisoner to the victim. 
        
       
       
        
        At about 5.40 am on the morning the prisoner was arrested. He had been drinking and his initial interview, when arrested was somewhat vague however at the electronically recorded interview later that day he admitted rubbing the victim’s legs and vagina but there was no suggestion of any form of penetration.” 
        
       
      
    3 It can be mentioned that, had there been penetration, a more serious offence would have been committed and the last statement, which did not appear in the tendered document, was an irrelevant gloss upon the facts. 
     
      
    4 The relationship between the appellant and the victim’s mother commenced when he was aged sixteen and the victim was the eldest of the four children.  
     
      
    5 The offence carries a prescribed maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment: Crimes Act s 61M (2). Pursuant to the table incorporated in s 54D of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Sentencing Act) there is specified a standard non parole period of five years. Somewhat surprisingly, a consequence of this prescription is, if it is applicable, the total term for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness (an expression in s 54A(2) of that Act) would necessarily be more than half the available maximum term. 
     
      
    6 The appellant was arrested on 29 February 2004 and refused bail. He later obtained bail and was conditionally released on 11 May 2004. He had therefore been in custody to that point for ten weeks and two days. Bail was revoked on 18 February 2005. Bishop DCJ ordered the sentence which he imposed to commence from the lastmentioned date.  
     
      
    7 From the remarks on sentence it can be deduced that his Honour constructed the sentence and orders in this fashion. Adverting to the standard non parole period specification of five years, he assessed a non parole period of four years. He reduced this by 25 percent to reflect the plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity. The resultant three years was reduced to two years nine months to allow for presentence custody which he approximated at three months. 
     
      
    8 He stated that there was “a case for varying the proportion with regard to parole supervision” and, although he ultimately expressed a total term, it is plain that he assessed the balance term of sentence of two years independently of setting the non parole period. Hence he imposed a total sentence of four years nine months.  
     
      
    9 He ordered the release of the appellant to parole upon expiry of the non parole period on 17 November 2007 although the power and obligation of the Court to make such an order is limited to sentences where the term is three years or less: see s 50 of the Sentencing Act. 
     
      
    10 The appellant’s notice of appeal sets out five specific grounds and a sixth ground asserting that the sentence is manifestly excessive. As I have reached the conclusion that this Court should intervene and proceed to resentence, beyond the Crown concession to which I made earlier reference, I will express my reasons incorporating the complaints comprehended in the grounds without dealing with them seriatim.  
     
      
    11 It was erroneous to set the non parole period independently of consideration of the total sentence. In R v P [2004] NSWCCA 218 Hulme J (Ipp JA and Hislop J agreeing) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Notwithstanding the temptation, provided by the terms of s44 of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
        , to think that his Honour’s approach of fixing the non-parole period and then independently fixing the balance of the term is the correct approach, in fact it is not. That was decided in  
        R v Moffitt 
         (1990) 20 NSWLR 114 at 134 in respect of earlier legislation but in  
        R v Way 
         (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 the court indicated that  
        R v Moffitt 
         should be followed in relation to the current wording of s44.” 
        
       
      
    12 The relevant observations in Way are: 
     
      
       
        
        “The way that was taken in  
        R v Moffitt 
         in relation to the former s 5 of the  
        Sentencing Act 
         did not require the sentencing judge to first determine a minimum term, which was thereafter immutable, notwithstanding a subsequent finding of special circumstances. In substance, the section specifies the sequence in which the sentence was to be set, focussing upon the period which was considered appropriate to be served by way of a minimum period of actual imprisonment, followed by the period for a potential supervised release on parole. 
        
       
       
        
        While there are separate considerations involved for s44(2) of the Act, they need not be regarded as involving a two-step or sequential process since, as Spigelman CJ pointed out in  
        R v Hampton 
         (1998) 44 NSWLR 729, the relevant steps can be taken simultaneously. 
        
       
       
        
        To this end the sentencing principles approved in  
        R v Moffitt 
         (at 117-118, 121-122 and 134-135) and also in  
        R v GDR 
         (1994) 35 NSWLR 376 at 381-382 will provide guidance.” 
        
       
      
    13 See also O’Connell v R [2006] NSWCCA 82. It appears that his Honour accepted that the appellant’s offence was classifiable as below the middle of the range of objective seriousness for the offence, but his finding was reached, at least in part, by impermissible reasoning. The contribution by counsel to these errors is patent in this extract from the remarks on sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        “The legislature has prescribed a standard non-parole period of five years. For the prisoner it was submitted that this offence was not in the middle range of seriousness due to the early plea of guilty and the absence of any form of penetration. The Crown did not dissent, nevertheless it seems to me that this offence was a gross breach of trust, even though it was impulsive.” 
        
       
      
    14 The appellant’s plea of guilty cannot be a factor in the assessment of the place in which the offence falls in a range of objective seriousness. An offence finds its place in the range by reason of its objective ingredients and not by reflection, even in part, of the plea of an offender. I have already mentioned the irrelevance of the absence of penetration yet these two matters appear to have been the reasons for the finding that the offence was not at mid range. Whilst there could be no legitimate criticism of his Honour’s finding that the offence was a gross breach of trust, he did not advert to objective facts which were pertinent to classification except to the extent that the reference to impulse implied that it was not an incident within a wider pattern of misconduct. 
     
      
    15 Complaint is made of his Honour’s remarks: 
     
      
       
        
        “As far as matters of aggravation are concerned the Crown stressed that the victim was the offender’s own child and that the effects on the family were extensive and that there was clearly emotional harm to a very vulnerable victim who was at home asleep.” 
        
       
      
    16 It has been assumed that his Honour was referring to the matters set out in s 21A(2) of the Sentencing Act as, indeed, it appears that he was responding to submissions made by counsel in this regard. In its terms the extract manifests a recitation of the Crown submission rather than a finding but it can be approached on the basis that his Honour accepted the Crown proposition: R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193. 
     
      
    17 It is contended on behalf of the appellant that, other than recording that shortly after the offence the victim was too upset to allow medical examination and the appellant’s statement to police that he thought she was scared at the time, there was no direct evidence of impact on the victim or the family. The immediate result of the commission of the offence was the separation of the appellant from the family. 
     
      
    18 The contention ignores the evidence of the appellant who gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings, when, inter alia, he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “….I understand what I have done and the damage I’ve caused and the impact it could have had on her as she grows older – yes, I mean, its something I can’t take back but I want to do whatever I can to make things right.” 
        
       
      
    19 The Crown observes that his Honour’s remarks do not extend to a description of the harm as being substantial which is the requisite criterion to fulfil s 21A (2)(g). Statute aside, it was appropriate for Bishop DCJ to recognize that harm was done to the victim, that recognition is a fundamental purpose of sentencing: R v Jammeh [2004] NSWCCA 32. 
     
      
    20 I would not uphold these complaints, however, I have already indicated that in my view this Court should intervene by reason of the errors earlier mentioned. It is to be borne in mind that whilst the standard non parole period provides “a reference point, or benchmark, or sounding board, or guidepost, along with other extrinsic aids…..” (Way @ p 192), in this case the use was apparently infected by using the plea of guilty and the absence of penetration in assessing where the offence stood in the range of seriousness. 
     
      
    21 Principally for that reason and for the error to structural approach which I have earlier mentioned, I am of opinion that intervention by this Court should occur.  
     
      
    22 I do not accept the Crown submission that no less severe sentence should have been imposed. In resentencing I would, like his Honour, find that the crime involved a gross breach of trust but I would also take into account that the behaviour was isolated and occurred in circumstances where it was easily able to be detected simply by his wife entering the room. The latter adds credibility to the appellant’s claim that he was markedly affected by his over indulgence in intoxicating liquor. His immediate expression of sorrow can be taken to display remorse as it was confirmed by his frank admissions to police and the plea of guilty at the very first opportunity.  
     
      
    23 Although my reasons differ from his Honour’s, I would classify the offence below the middle of the range of seriousness for such. In any event, the standard non parole period is potentially applicable after trial which was not held as a result of the appellant’s plea of guilty: see Way. The appellant had a minor prior record which included no offence of a sexual nature nor the use of violence against a person. 
     
      
    24 Taking into account all matters with the exception of utilitarian value of the plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity I would assess an appropriate sentence at a total of four years imprisonment. For the plea of guilty I would reduce that period by 25 percent to a period of three years. I would find special circumstances particularly to enable the supervision of the appellant to gauge the effects of any counselling that he undertakes concerning his alcohol problem. On the issue of resentence we have his affidavit affirmed 30 March 2006 which shows that he is making the best of his opportunities whilst in custody and has undertaken some appropriate courses particularly with respect to drug and alcohol use and anger management. He has no gaol offences and this is reflected in the circumstance that he has already achieved C2 classification. 
     
      
    25 I would set a non parole period of one year six months commencing on 28 November 2004 which is ten weeks and two days prior to the commencement of his continuing custody on 18 February 2005 and gives credit for the period of custody prior to bail being refused. 
     
      
    26 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
       
      2. Appeal against sentence allowed. 
       
      3. Sentence imposed in the District Court quashed and in lieu thereof the appellant sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of one year six months commencing on 28 November 2004 and expiring on 27 May 2006 with a balance term of one year six months commencing on 28 May 2006 and expiring on 27 November 2007.  
       
      4. The appellant be ordered released to parole on 27 May 2006. 
       
      
    27 SIMPSON J: I agree. 
     
      
    28 HOWIE J: I also agree. 
     
      
    29 GROVE J: The orders of the Court will be as I have proposed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
       
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an Crown appeal asserting the manifest inadequacy of sentence imposed by Black DCJ in the District Court at Lismore.  
     
      
    2 The respondent was tried upon indictment containing a single count of fraudulently omitting to account contrary to s 178A of the Crimes Act 1900. The offence occurred in October 2002 and the trial took place in February and March 2006. As recorded in a pre sentence report by a Ms Perrie dated 13 April 2006, the respondent does not accept the finding of guilt by the jury and “repeatedly expressed his innocence regarding the offence.” 
     
      
    3 In October 2002, the respondent was a manager employed by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. He had been an employee of the bank for most of his working life which was a period of about twenty seven years. A number of elderly customers of the bank resided in a complex including a nursing home and the respondent used visit them to attend to any of their banking needs. One of these, a Mrs Loder, came into possession of a cheque from the National Australia Bank for a sum of a little over $73,000. This was apparently a return of some capital following alteration in her living circumstances within the complex. The cheque was given to the respondent for the purpose of investment of the proceeds. The respondent did not do so and he did not account for the money. Mrs Loder died and the matter apparently came to light when the executor of her will discovered a receipt for the funds. 
     
      
    4 The respondent was charged in September 2003. Upon being charged he was dismissed from his employment by the bank. Thereafter, up to the time of trial, he obtained some employment as a courier and as a debt collector. Enquiry by Ms Perrie at the debt collection agency revealed that the respondent was considered good at his job and was a valued employee. However, he had not informed them of the pending charge and a representative stated that it was improbable that he would have been offered employment if this had been revealed. 
     
      
    5 The respondent was born on 10 April 1958. He is a married man and he and his wife have three children. He has no other convictions. 
     
      
    6 The maximum prescribed penalty for an offence contrary to s 178A is imprisonment for seven years. Black DCJ sentenced the respondent to imprisonment for a term of three years and specified a non parole period of one year nine months. In specifying that non parole period his Honour found special circumstances within the meaning of applicable legislation. 
     
      
    7 The Crown notice of appeal asserted a single ground that the sentence was manifestly inadequate, but in written submissions there were advanced separate grounds which included manifest inadequacy as an expressed fifth ground. It is convenient to deal with these grounds as now stated. 
     
      
    8 Ground 1. The sentencing judge erred in declining to find that breach of trust was an aggravating feature under section 21A (2)(k) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    9 Section 21A (2)(k) reads as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “(k) The offender abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim.” 
        
       
      
    10 It had been the Crown submission to Black DCJ that such an aggravating factor was present. In his remarks on sentence his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “People who hold a position of trust as far as the community is concerned have to realise that the consequences of breaching that are significant. 
        
       
       
        
        Having referred to the question of trust I am not satisfied, despite what the Crown says, that subs (k) of subs (2) is appropriate to add in as an aggravating factor, because I take the view in this case that was an element of this offence.” 
        
       
      
    11 It is submitted to this Court that these remarks reveal error because breach of trust is not an express or essential element of an offence contrary to s 178A. It is pointed out that no direction was given to the jury that proof of breach of trust was requisite to sustaining the prosecution case. 
     
      
    12 I observe that breach of trust in the sense of misconduct by a trustee may not necessarily be synonymous with abusing a position of trust as expressed in s 21A (2) (k). Be that as it may, it was his Honour’s task to sentence the respondent for what he had done and to avoid what has come to be referred to as “double counting” in making sentence assessment.  
     
      
    13 I would respectfully endorse the observations of Howie J in Elyard v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 43: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is unfortunate indeed that those responsible for drafting s 21A of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
         have made the task of sentencing courts more difficult, or at least more prone to error (either real or apparent), by what was in my opinion a needless attempt to define relevant factors into categories of aggravation or mitigation and yet apparently without the intention of altering the common law as it was applied to sentencing before the advent of the section. One has only to look back over sentence appeals determined by this Court over the last two years to see the impact that this section has had upon the work of this Court. And yet, as I pointed out in  
        R v Tadrosse 
         [2005] NSWCCA 145, if sentencing judges simply take into account the relevant sentencing factors that were taken into account before the introduction of the section, they will inevitably comply with the section’s demands.” 
        
       
      
    14 In my opinion it would be an unproductive exercise to analyse whether some form of breach of trust or underlying policy to that effect is a characteristic of an offence against s 178A. Black DCJ clearly recognized the respondent’s culpability in taking possession of the cheque from the elderly customer and failing to account for its proceeds. Once he had taken those facts into account there was no call to elevate an appropriate penalty for that misconduct.  
     
      
    15 I am unpersuaded that his Honour has been demonstrated to have fallen into error and would reject this ground. 
     
      
    16 Ground 2. The sentencing judge erred in giving too much weight to good character. 
     
      
    17 As the expression of this ground conveys the complaint is focussed upon weight. The Crown’s submissions do not identify any particular factor constituting miscarriage of his Honour’s discretion. His findings that the considerable quantity of referees whose testaments had been tendered harboured a great admiration for the respondent and that he had (in the past) contributed significantly to the welfare of the community were not challenged. 
     
      
    18 It is not perceptible that his Honour attributed too much weight to these factors insofar as they favoured the respondent. 
     
      
    19 Ground 3. The sentencing judge erred in not giving weight to general deterrence. 
     
      
    20 The Crown submission relies upon two related matters. The first is that an express submission was made to his Honour that there was a need for general deterrence and, second, that his Honour made no reference in his remarks on sentence (described in a written submission as “his judgment”) to general deterrence. 
     
      
    21 Whether a sentence is sufficient to operate as a deterrent to other would-be offenders can be gauged by its content. Mere incantation that general deterrence has been taken into account will not assist in determining whether a sentence has been infected by error.  
     
      
    22 There is nothing in the sentence as assessed demonstrating that the need for general deterrence was ignored. 
     
      
    23 Ground 4. The sentencing judge erred in finding special circumstances. 
     
      
    24 The written submissions by the Crown in support of this ground commenced with the statement:  
     
      
       
        
        “The sentencing judge found special circumstances in circumstances where such a finding was not justified and an extended period of supervision was not required.” 
        
       
      
    25 However, the final sentence in that submission is: 
     
      
       
        
        “….that in the respondent’s case there was no circumstance sufficiently special to justify the variation.” 
        
       
      
    26 His Honour was expressly alert to the fact that because a matter was capable of amounting to a special circumstance, a finding to that effect does not become obligatory. He found special circumstances in a combination of matters which he stated to be the respondent’s age, his state of health, which was evidenced, and carried an implication that it was likely to make his service in incarceration more onerous than would ordinarily be the case and a need for assistance in re-establishment into the community on release. 
     
      
    27 Each of those matters was available to constitute a special circumstance and provided a legitimate foundation for his findings. 
     
      
    28 The Crown has calculated that the non parole period specified is in fact equivalent to 58 percent of the total term. This can be contrasted with 75 percent of total term which would follow application of the statutory ratio. Once it is accepted, as I do, that special circumstances were available to be found, the question is whether the departure from statutory ratio has been so great as to show latent error. The proposition of such error cannot be sustained in the light of the figures just quoted. 
     
      
    29 Ground 5. The sentence is manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    30 As already observed this is the essential ground specified in the notice of appeal and to the extent that some grounds complain of matters of weight, an ultimate judgment can be made against the imposition which his Honour made. It has already been mentioned that the total term approaches one half of the maximum available penalty. In support of final submissions on this encompassing ground the Crown points to the elderly victim, the gross “breach of trust”, the significant sum of money and the absence of contrition. The lastmentioned can, of course, be a matter which will deprive an offender of a claim for mitigation but it is not a matter which contributes to the heinousness of an offence.  
     
      
    31 Against the inculpatory factors which his Honour’s remarks show have been expressly taken into account, it is necessary to balance factors such as the respondent’s prior good character, his credit worthy previous contributions to the community and the apparent unlikelihood of repetition of offence.  
     
      
    32 It is significant to note that there was evidence before his Honour that the respondent had an accrued superannuation benefit which, as a result of his dismissal, reduced what would have been a benefit of $284,000 to something in the order of $128,000. His Honour expressly took into account this effectively non curial punishment and it has not been suggested that he was in error in so doing.  
     
      
    33 In my view the sentence imposed by Black DCJ lay well within the ambit of the sound exercise of his discretion. 
     
      
    34 I would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    35 TOBIAS JA: I agree with Justice Grove. 
     
      
    36 BELL J: I also agree. 
     
      
    37 TOBIAS JA: The order of the Court will be that the appeal is dismissed.

     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
      Non-publication order: 
       
      I order that both the making of this application and the reasons in relation to the application not be published until after the conclusion of the trial of the applicant. 
       
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: This is an application for leave to appeal pursuant to s 5F(3)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act, 1912. The applicant has been charged with twelve offences, generally of a sexual character. He has been charged in relation to six incidents and in relation to each incident, there are two alternative charges. 
     
      
    2 The Crown case depends, as I understand it, significantly on the evidence of SH. The Crown also has evidence from SC, who, it is alleged, at least for a time, was the de facto partner of SH. During the course of pre-trial hearings in relation to the question of tendency and coincidence evidence, which, as it happened, had taken place before a judge other than the judge assigned to the present trial, SH gave evidence. 
     
      
    3 She said in her evidence that some of the material contained in a statement dated 25 June 2003 was not correct. She also said that the signature on that statement was not hers, but was a forgery. 
     
      
    4 It is conceded by the applicant that the factual material to which SH refers does not have great significance for the trial. However, whether or not she is telling the truth in relation to the matters in the statement and her signature are said to be matters of significance in relation to her credit. 
     
      
    5 SC has also given evidence in the pre-trial hearings in which he denies that the signature on one statement is his. He disavows the complete statement and says that it is a forgery. As I understand the position, the Crown does not propose to call SC in its case, but the defence requires him to be called for cross-examination. 
     
      
    6 Again, as I understand the position, it is said that the evidence which SC has given at these pre-trial hearings may be of significance in relation to his credit. 
     
      
    7 Counsel for the applicant referred the court to other allegations in relation to activities of SC. Those allegations relate to an alleged “deal”, which he is said to have brokered with the television program, Today Tonight, for the giving of information in relation to the alleged activities of the applicant. It is alleged that the deal with the television channel to give this information was for money. Tied in with that allegation is an allegation relating to a letter seeking to extort money from the applicant. It is also alleged that SC illegally recorded a private conversation with the applicant in which he sought confessions from him. 
     
      
    8 Although these matters were raised, when ultimately analysed, they seem to me to play no part in the application which is now made. The essence of the applicant’s submission is that unless the allegation that the statements have been interfered with and the signatures are forgeries are properly investigated, the applicant may be denied a fair trial. 
     
      
    9 As I understand the position, it is submitted that if it be the case that the allegations which those witnesses make are true, they would probably play no further part in the trial. However, if it was to transpire that those allegations were not correct, it would be submitted that they have lied on their oath in the earlier hearings and accordingly, should be disbelieved in relation to any evidence which they give in the ultimate trial. 
     
      
    10 Consideration of the matter this morning reveals that the police officers who took the relevant statements have so far not given evidence in any of the pre-trial hearings. Those police officers are available to give evidence and the Crown indicates that if requested by the defence, they would be prepared to call those officers. 
     
      
    11 The outcome of such an enquiry and whether or not it may produce any admissible evidence, and I mean by that admissible at the trial, is unclear. The only other investigation, which it is suggested could be made, would be to have a handwriting expert examine the signature of SH on the challenged statement, and provide an opinion as to whether or not that signature is a forgery, or is her signature. The opportunity to assess the validity of the signatures through the expertise of a handwriting expert is available to the defence, as much as it is to the Crown. I see no merit in the suggestion that it falls for the Crown to take that step. If the defence wishes to take that step, they may do so. Whether or not, it would result in evidence which could be admitted at the trial, this Court need not consider. However, that matter would need careful consideration by the trial judge. 
     
      
    12 There being no other inquiry which would appear relevant, in my opinion, there is no substance in any suggestion that if this trial is required to proceed, it could result in any injustice by reason of the complaints which have been raised. However, no doubt, if an application is made to the trial judge for further inquiry before the trial, in relation to the evidence which the police officers taking the statements may give, the trial judge would accede to it. It would seem to be an inquiry which would take a very short period of time. 
     
      
    13 As far as handwriting experts are concerned, that is a matter which, as I have indicated, falls within the power of the applicant to pursue. Perhaps, if it emerged that the basic inquiries could not be made within a short compass, it may be necessary for arrangements to be made to ensure that the evidence, if the matter is pursued, could at least be tendered at the trial. 
     
      
    14 However, the inquiry which the handwriting expert would make would be a very limited one, and would not seem to me to require much time, or, indeed, result in any necessity to further significantly delay this trial. 
     
      
    15 In the circumstances, it seems to me the application does not have sufficient merit to warrant a grant of leave by this Court. Accordingly, in my opinion, leave should be refused. 
     
      
    16 HIDDEN J: I agree. 
     
      
    17 PRICE J: I agree. 
     
      
    18 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: Accordingly, leave is refused. I order that both the making of this application and the reasons in relation to the application not be published until after the conclusion of the trial of the applicant.

     Judgment 
      
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an application to extend time and, if granted, to appeal against conviction on two counts of maliciously wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    2 The applicant was indicted on two counts charging wounding with intent to murder - counts 1 and 3 in the indictment - upon which the jury returned verdicts of not guilty, and in the alternative, on counts 2 and 4, to the offences upon which he was convicted. The two victims were brothers, Ahmed Marnosh Zikria and Mustafa Zikria. 
     
      
    3 The trial was heard before Coorey DCJ and a jury at Campbelltown District Court beginning on 21 May 2002 and concluding on 5 June 2002. The Crown case was that the victims were part of a group of people in an area of a cinema complex at Mount Druitt on 22 April 2001. There was an existing animosity borne, at least by the victims, towards the applicant and his brother, Matin Baquayee. A fight broke out and it can be noted that his Honour found, on ample supporting evidence, that the Zikria brothers, particularly Ahmed Marnosh Zikria, were the aggressors. Matin Baquayee gave evidence that the latter addressed threats to him followed by the delivery of a kick whereupon he heard two loud bangs.  
     
      
    4 These were, on the Crown case, shots from a pistol produced by the applicant which wounded both the Zikrias. Ahmed Marnosh Zikria was shot in the thigh causing a fracture to his femur and the lodgement of bullet fragments in his flesh. Mustafa was shot in the epigastric region and damaged his liver and lung. His injuries were life-threatening and he was in a coma for two weeks following the wounding. 
     
      
    5 Coorey DCJ imposed concurrent sentences on each count of six years with non-parole periods of two years nine months on 17 March 2003. 
     
      
    6 A Crown appeal complaining of the manifest inadequacy of the sentences was heard by this court (differently constituted) and on 19 December 2003 the appeal was allowed and increased sentences were imposed, the overall effect of which was to set terms expiring ultimately on 4 June 2012 with non-parole periods setting the earliest date of eligibility for parole at 4 June 2008. 
     
      
    7 An application for special leave to appeal against that judgment was refused by the High Court of Australia on 30 November 2004. 
     
      
    8 Leave to appeal against the convictions was filed in this court on 4 May 2005. In an affidavit sworn on 7 February 2006 the applicant asserted that a notice of intention to appeal was allowed to lapse by Legal Aid but this was contrary to his instructions. He is not now legally represented and states that he has prepared written submissions in relation to challenging conviction with the assistance of another inmate, it being at all times his intention to appeal as he considers that he has been unfairly convicted. The delay, it is implied, is a result of cumulating factors including having directed his attention primarily to the sentence appeal process and the difficulties encountered in acting as his own legal representative. 
     
      
    9 The issue of extension of time can remain in abeyance whilst examining the grounds of appeal against conviction upon which the applicant wishes to rely. 
     
      
    10 Ground 1 asserts that the trial judge erred in law under s 114 of the Evidence Act in admitting “in-court” identification evidence. 
     
      
    11 Section 114 makes provision against the admissibility of identification evidence where, in effect without good reason, an identification parade is not held. 
     
      
    12 There was no issue at trial concerning the identity of the applicant as a person present at the incident in the theatre complex. Matin Baquayee gave evidence that he was behind his brother, the applicant, when he heard two loud bangs (T298 of 21 May 2002).  
     
      
    13 The appellant draws attention to the content of various statements which manifested some possible confusion and contradictory allegations about which Baquayee brother was responsible for the wounding. Fairly plainly, at one point at least, Ahmed Marnosh Zikria had nominated Matin Baquayee. These matters were legitimately explored during cross-examination of both the victims. Properly ventilated trial issues are not matters for reconsideration on appeal. 
     
      
    14 The complaints now sought to be made can be addressed in the context of what the applicant was asserting through counsel. He elected not to give evidence himself but counsel advanced the proposition that it was Ahmed Marnosh Zikria who produced the gun. This was explicitly put to him when cross-examined at trial. I set out some relevant cross-examination (T174 of 24 May): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Maybe you were the cause of your own injuries Mr Zikria? Maybe that is why you are so angry and upset? 
         
        A. No. I blame myself because I didn’t take the other bullet for my brother. That is why. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You were the one in fact who pulled the gun out of the front of your pants weren’t you? 
         
        A. I beg your pardon? 
         
         
        Q. You were the one who pulled the gun out of the front of your pants weren’t you? 
         
        A. I don’t pull out weapons. I never pulled out a weapon in my life. 
         
         
        Q. And as you were pulling the gun out of your pants the accused went for your gun, didn’t he? 
         
        A. No. No. Nothing like that. 
         
         
        Q. And then you started struggling with the accused, didn’t you? 
         
        A. No. I don’t pull out weapons on no one, on no one. 
         
         
        Q. That is what happened, isn’t it? 
         
        A. No. No, no, no. 
         
         
        Q. And then you and the accused both started struggling for the gun and it was during the struggle, the gun went off? 
         
        A. No, nothing like that happened. 
         
         
        Q. And you were shot, and your younger brother were shot almost immediately afterwards? 
         
        A. Nothing like that happened, no.” 
         
        
       
      
    15 Mustafa Zikria was also cross-examined to the same effect (T247 of 24 May):  
     
      
       
        
        “Q. So what was the reason you got involved in this fight? 
         
        A. There was no reason and there was no fight, an argument was happening and someone decides to pull out a gun and shoot away. 
         
         
        Q. That’s it, someone decides to pull out a gun? 
         
        A. No when I say ‘someone’ I mean the accused sitting right there. 
         
         
        Q. No, that’s your word Mr Zikria? 
         
        A. Yeah it’s my word. 
         
         
        Q. Someone decides to pull out a gun? 
         
        A. When I say someone I mean as in the accused, right there. 
         
         
        Q. You didn’t say the accused-- 
         
        A. That’s what I mean-- 
         
         
        Q. ‘Someone decides to pull out the gun’, who is that someone Mr Zikria? 
         
        A. That someone is sitting right there, I’m looking at him right now. 
         
         
        Q. That someone wasn’t the accused at all, was it? 
         
        A. Yes he was. 
         
         
        Q. That someone was your own brother? 
         
        A. Excuse me? 
         
         
        Q. Do you want me to put it to you again? 
         
        A. Yeah I would like that. 
         
         
        Q. That someone was your own brother wasn’t it? 
         
        A. My brother would shoot me, I don’t think so, I know who shot me okay, I’m not stupid, I (w)as looking at him. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. He may have done it by accident Mr Zikria? 
         
        A. No, no accident, my brother has never held a gun in his life, he did not have no gun that night.” 
        
       
       
      
    16 There was no objection at trial to the evidence concerning the applicant. It was, of course, disputed but it was not inadmissible. His Honour made no error by reason of s 114 or at all in admitting the evidence. 
     
      
    17 Ground 2 complains of what the applicant refers to as double jeopardy. In addition to the written submissions we have this morning received an elaboration which essentially advances the same things.  
     
      
    18 The applicant has extracted from reported judgments, statements relating to the doctrines of autrefois convict and autrefois acquit. He has also referred to s 23 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The only part of that provision which is presently relevant is the affirmation of the entitlement of the Crown to insert alternative counts in an indictment. 
     
      
    19 That is what happened here. The elements to be proved in respect of counts 1 and 3 were not identical in all respects to those requiring proof in counts 2 and 4, nor were the elements of the alternative counts subsumed within the principal charges. The doctrines referred to have potential to operate only when the elements are the same.  
     
      
    20 The references to s163 of the Criminal Procedure Act and other sections are similarly misguided. There was only one indictment and, by definition, there were no further proceedings. It does not assist the argument to extract from dictionaries (as was submitted) various meanings of the word “further”. What needs to be determined is what “further proceedings” means in the context of this statute. Verdicts on alternative counts in one indictment do not involve “further proceedings.” 
     
      
    21 The applicant’s submissions show a misunderstanding of the relevant principles and an attempt to misapply that misunderstanding. There is no merit in this ground. 
     
      
    22 Ground 3 asserts that the jury was misled. Submissions revert to complaint about the absence of an identification parade. As I have already discussed, there was no issue requiring identification of the applicant as a person engaged in the melee which left the Zikria brothers wounded, but the issue was what the applicant did. The jury were not misled. 
     
      
    23 Ground 4 refers to the directions given by the learned trial judge concerning the election of the applicant to remain silent at trial. His Honour directed the jury in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ladies and gentlemen, the other thing I want to say to you is this, that in this trial there has been reference to silence. You heard it said by Mr Amer and I think the Crown might have referred to it as well, the right to silence. Can I just say this to you, that in this case the accused exercised his right to silence in this courtroom. The accused in this courtroom pleaded not guilty and he said nothing else to you in this courtroom, but he has that right and ladies and gentlemen, the law is very clear, that you must not draw any adverse inference against the accused because he exercised his legal right to silence. You must not interpret that in some way as being an acknowledgment on his part of the Crown case or any part of the Crown case. It is not. You might be tempted to reason or argue well because he remained silent therefore he is guilty, but that would be quite wrong. Ladies and gentlemen, as a judge, you act only on the evidence, nothing else and as a judge, the fact that he exercised his right to silence means in this court, nothing more than he exercised his right to silence. It is a legal right. If you think about it there would be no point us having a legal right to silence if we cannot exercise it. But that is an important principle which you heard Mr Amer refer to again today and I repeat that for you. 
        
       
       
        
        Ladies and gentlemen, in the interview he could have again, when he spoke to police, he could have said, ‘I want to say nothing’, but indeed in that interview he made a statement. He gave the police officer a prepared statement which he had made and you have regard to that. That is part of the evidence which you now look at and you might think well, because he has given that statement, that might be the reason why he never gave evidence in this courtroom. You do not know. Or he might have received legal advice not to give evidence in the courtroom. You do not know. There are so many variables that you do not know about that as a judge all you can do is to say to yourself, well he exercised his right to silence. As a judge I draw no adverse inference against him. Ladies and gentlemen, I repeat that that is a very important principle.” 
        
       
       
      
    24 The applicant referred to what was said in Azzopardi v The Queen (2001) 205 CLR 50 to be “almost always desirable” for a judge to include in warning a jury. It might be noted that the language used does not say a judge must do so. The “desirable” warnings include a warning against using silence to fill gaps in prosecution evidence. As the above directions manifest, his Honour did not use these explicit terms. 
     
      
    25 The applicant asserts that the situation is the same in R v Macris [2004] NSWCCA 26 where the absence of incanting that warning was held to be an error requiring a finding that the trial has miscarried. Certainly the situations in this case and that one are analogous but it was held in R v Wilson (2005) 62 NSWLR 346 that Macris should not be followed. 
     
      
    26 I adhere to the views in the expression of which I participated in Wilson. Apart from the regularity of adhering to the later authority, I reiterate that the disapproved view in Macris was itself contrary to earlier judgments of this court in R v Richards (2002) 128 A Crim R 204; R v SMR [2002] NSWCCA 258; and R v Park [2003] NSWCCA 203.  
     
      
    27 It is not an inevitable error of law not to include every aspect of the suggested cautions mentioned in Azzopardi. The question is whether a warning was appropriate to the issues in the particular case, a question which must of course be answered with proper attention to the guidance offered by Azzopardi. The warnings by his Honour were entirely appropriate to this case. 
     
      
    28 None of the grounds advanced should be sustained. Whilst I am doubtful that the explanation of the applicant would justify the immense delay pursuing the appeal, in the particular circumstances I would grant the extension of time to appeal but I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. 
     
      
    29 SIMPSON J: I agree. 
     
      
    30 HOWIE J: I also agree. 
     
      
    31 GROVE J: The orders of the court therefore will be as I have proposed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: This is an application for leave to appeal against the sentences imposed by his Honour Judge Maguire QC with respect to a number of sexual assault offences. The Applicant pleaded guilty to the offences, which he had committed against three infant children between November 2000 and October 2005. Two of those infants were the Applicant’s natural children and the third was a young child whom he was babysitting. 
     
      
    2 The critical feature of the present appeal is that the offending conduct became known as a result of a full confession made by the Applicant, albeit after suspicions had been aroused in the mind of a friend whose daughter was a pupil at the same school as the Applicant’s son and who had come to learn of inappropriate sexual conduct by that boy. 
     
      
    3 His Honour summarised the critical facts with respect to the offences as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Sequence 1. 
        
       
       
        
        On a date between 12 November 2000 and 11 November 2002 the offender masturbated himself in the presence and sight of his son who was aged somewhere between one and two and a half years. I accept that the boy saw and registered what the offender had done. Two similar offences were committed in the same period. 
        
       
       
        
        Sequence 4. 
        
       
       
        
        Between 25 April 2004 and 25 June 2005 the offender and his daughter both naked were in the bath together. The child was aged between one and two years. He rubbed his penis on her genital area until he ejaculated. A similar offence was committed in the same period. 
        
       
       
        
        Sequence 6. 
        
       
       
        
        During the same time frame while the two of them were again naked in the bath together, the child bit the offender’s penis. Three similar offences were committed in the same period. 
        
       
       
        
        Sequence 10. 
        
       
       
        
        Between 1 June 2005 and 31 August 2005 the offender was babysitting a neighbour’s one year old daughter when he masturbated himself in her presence. He told police, ‘I wanted to masturbate and I wanted her to see me’. 
        
       
       
        
        Sequence 11. 
        
       
       
        
        During the same period as in sequence 6 while the offender and the daughter were naked in the bath together, he licked her vagina on the outside. Three similar offences were committed in the same period. 
        
       
       
        
        These offences were all committed in the offender’s home in the small rural community [where he lived]. They came to light after the offender’s son was found to be interfering with other boys at the local school. The offender was actively involved in the school as a parent. Following the discovery of the son’s transgressions, the offender was confronted by a woman friend whose daughter was a pupil at the school. Eventually he confessed to this woman. 
        
       
       
        
        Then on 17 November 2005 accompanied by his friend … who was a elder of his church – he presented himself to the police at …” 
        
       
      
    4 The charge referred to as “Sequence 1” was an offence contrary to s61O(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for seven years. Two other offences were to be taken into account on a Form 1.  
     
      
    5 The charge referred to as “Sequence 4” was an offence contrary to s61M(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 10 years. Furthermore, Item 9B of the Table in Div 1A of Pt 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides a standard minimum non-parole period of five years for an offence contrary to this section. The other offence referred to was to be taken into account on a Form 1.  
     
      
    6 The charge referred to as “Sequence 6” was an offence contrary to s66A of the Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 25 years. A standard minimum non-parole period of 15 years is specified for an offence contrary to s66A. The other three offences referred to were to be taken into account on a Form 1.  
     
      
    7 The charge referred to as “Sequence 10” was an offence contrary to s61O(2) of the Crimes Act 1900.  
     
      
    8 The charge referred to as “Sequence 11” was an offence contrary to s66A of the Crimes Act 1900. The additional three offences were to be taken into account on a Form 1. 
     
      
    9 On 5 October 2006, the sentencing judge sentenced the Applicant to the following terms of imprisonment: 
     
      
       
        
        On charge Sequence 10: a non-parole period of 18 months to commence on 17 July 2006 and expire on 16 January 2008 with a balance of term of 18 months to commence on 17 January 2008 and expire on 16 July 2009. 
        
       
       
        
        On both charge Sequence 6 (taking into account the offences on Form 1 C) and charge Sequence 11 (taking into account the offences on Form 1 D): a non-parole period of three years to commence on 17 January 2007 and expire on 16 January 2010 with a balance of term of three years to commence on 17 January 2010 and expire on 16 January 2013. 
        
       
       
        
        On charge Sequence 4 (taking into account the offence on Form 1B): a non-parole period of 21 months to commence on 17 January 2007 and expire 16 October 2008 (scil) with a balance of term of 21 months to commence on 17 October 2008 (scil) and expire on 16 July 2010. 
        
       
       
        
        On charge Sequence 1 (taking into account the offences on Form 1 A): a non-parole period of two years to commence on 17 January 2007 and expire on 16 January 2009 with a balance of term of two years to commence on 17 January 2009 and expire on 16 January 2011. 
        
       
      
    10 The Applicant was sentenced to an effective minimum term of imprisonment of three and a half years, to commence on 17 July 2006 and to expire on 16 January 2010, with an additional term of three years to commence on 17 January 2010 and to expire on 16 January 2011. The effective non-parole period is therefore 54 percent of the effective head sentence. 
     
      
    11 His Honour summarised, in a manner to which no objection is taken, the evidence concerning the subjective features of the Respondent including a Probation and Parole Report, and his assessment by psychologists, together with the written testimonials and the Applicant’s own evidence. It is unnecessary to set out this evidence. His Honour concluded that the Applicant had a good prospect of rehabilitation, subject to accepting appropriate guidance. He made a finding of special circumstances by reason of the need for an extended period of supervision. 
     
      
    12 There is no ground of appeal asserting that the sentences were manifestly excessive. However, the Applicant alleges error in three respects. 
     
      
    13 The first ground of appeal is that the learned sentencing judge erred in failing to give appropriate consideration to the fact that the Applicant voluntarily disclosed his guilt of the offences in circumstances where it was unlikely that the authorities would have discovered his guilt. 
     
      
    14 That a consideration of this character is a factor entitled to significant weight in the sentencing exercise is well established. It is a matter to be taken into account over and above the consideration to be given to a plea of guilty. (See R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 esp at 604; R v Thompson (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at [138]; Ryan v The Queen (2001) 206 CLR 267 at 272; R v Lewins (2007) NSWCCA 189 at [17]-[18]). 
     
      
    15 As Ms B Rigg, who appeared for the Applicant, submitted in this Court there was substantial evidence of the Applicant’s contrition and also of his prospects of rehabilitation. His contrition was plainly of the highest order and his prospects of rehabilitation were clearly very good, as his Honour found. Nevertheless his confessions were accordingly more than simply corroboration of these matters. 
     
      
    16 On the facts of the case, it is quite clear that the particular offences would not have been discovered but for the Applicant’s complete confession. The children involved were very young. Nevertheless, by reason of the suspicion that had arisen in the mind of the other parent at the school, concerning the inappropriate behaviour of the Applicant’s son, and the fact that that son was subject to some treatment by reason of that behaviour, there was a real probability of a course of investigation that would reveal some offending behaviour. This does not, however, detract from the entitlement of the Applicant to a significant amelioration of his sentence for his prompt and full confession, and for the high level of contrition which was manifest by his conduct in this respect. 
     
      
    17 The sentencing judge does not expressly refer to this consideration in his remarks on sentence. However, he does refer both to the confession to the other parent and to the Applicant’s attendance at the police station where he eventually made a complete confession. In the course of submissions on sentence R v Ellis was expressly referred to and the Crown accepted that it was applicable. 
     
      
    18 Plainly it would have been preferable for his Honour to expressly acknowledge the significance of this factor. Nevertheless, I am quite satisfied that his Honour took it into account and gave it substantial weight. The best indication of the weight that his Honour gave was the actual sentences imposed by his Honour. Given the objective seriousness of the offences against very young children, and the continuation of the offending conduct over a period of time with multiple victims, the effective non-parole period of three and a half years with an additional term of three years indicates that his Honour gave the Applicant a high degree of leniency. Although there were a number of subjective features that must have contributed to that leniency, there is no doubt in my mind that the voluntary confessions made by the Applicant, where his conduct would in all likelihood have not otherwise been discovered, played a significant role in his Honour’s final determination. 
     
      
    19 This ground of appeal should be rejected. 
     
      
    20 The second ground of appeal is that the sentencing judge erred in making an observation that the Applicant’s son had been adversely affected by the Applicant’s crimes. 
     
      
    21 This is not a matter which arises from any comment made by his Honour in his remarks on sentence. The relevant comment was made in the course of submissions on sentence. In the course of the Crown’s submissions concerning the emotional harm to the victims, the Crown made submissions about what may happen to the victims when they were older. At this point his Honour interrupted to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “Well, it is worse than that here, because whilst it is often said that one doesn’t know the effects of child abuse upon a child, and it may not manifest itself for a long time, so far as the little boy is concerned, his life has already been adversely affected.” 
        
       
      
    22 He went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “He was already demonstrating anti social behaviour which is clearly the fruits of his father’s crime.” [T7] 
        
       
      
    23 The Crown indicated agreement with his Honour’s remarks. No submission to the contrary was made by counsel appearing for the Applicant. If this perfectly logical inference was to be challenged, it could and should have occurred during the course of submissions. The Applicant’s counsel was given an express opportunity to make further submissions (T8 line 8).  
     
      
    24 Indeed, the psychologist’s report, upon which counsel for the Applicant primarily relied, expressly stated that it was the Applicant’s own realisation that there was such a causal connection that had triggered the Applicant’s confession. The Report said: 
     
      
       
        
        “While [the Applicant] initially appears to have been in denial of the possible impact of aberrant sexual behaviour on the children involved, when he realised his son was showing signs of having been sexually abused he sought professional treatment for the child. When he realised his own aberrant sexual behaviour was the issue [the Applicant] made frank confessions and reported himself to Police.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    25 This observation goes beyond simply a statement of the Applicant’s belief. It reflects the professional view taken both by the person treating the son and the psychologist preparing this report that such a link was probable. 
     
      
    26 In written submissions in this Court counsel for the Applicant submitted that no conclusion of the character his Honour drew was reasonably available. The proposition that the child was behaving in an inappropriate way was said to have been based on hearsay. It was also submitted that there was no evidence attributing the behaviour of the child to the misconduct of the Applicant. Specifically, it was submitted that some form of expert evidence was required to draw the causal connection. 
     
      
    27 It is not usually the case that remarks by a sentencing judge in the course of submissions should be regarded as a matter to which his Honour had regard when imposing the sentence, as in this case, some months later. Nevertheless, his Honour’s remarks on sentence are not so comprehensive as to enable this Court to dismiss the possibility that this matter was not still in his Honour’s mind. 
     
      
    28 As to the conduct of the son being hearsay that is not a pertinent submission. The fact that such conduct had occurred was accepted by all. In any event, by s4 of the Evidence Act 1995, that Act does not apply to sentence proceedings unless the Court makes a direction to that effect. There was no such direction. 
     
      
    29 Nor is it necessary, in my opinion, for there to be expert evidence on matters have become common knowledge and are, in principle, capable of inference on the basis of common sense. The possibility of a link between the Applicant’s conduct and his son’s behaviour was, in my opinion, an inference open to be drawn by his Honour and to be so drawn beyond reasonable doubt. In any event, as noted above, there was express reference to such a causal relationship in the Report of the Applicant’s psychologist. 
     
      
    30 In my opinion this ground of appeal should also be rejected. 
     
      
    31 At the hearing of this appeal, the Applicant raised a third ground of appeal. It was submitted that his Honour erred in his treatment of s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. It was submitted that, although his Honour referred to s21A he did not indicate how he had considered matters of aggravation. This ground overlaps with the second ground. 
     
      
    32 His Honour’s actual reference to quote it, was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am mindful of the provisions of s214 and have taken them into account.” 
        
       
      
    33 The obligation to give reasons requires a sentencing judge to identify which matters have been taken into account. However, a general reference of the character made by his Honour to the effect that he had generally taken into account s21A may indicate no more than that he had considered the whole list of aggravating and mitigating factors but had given weight to those identified in his remarks on sentence. 
     
      
    34 The Applicant referred to observations in this Court in R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193 at [31] and R v Wilson (2005) 62 NSWLR 346 at [42] where the sentencing judge or the Crown in submissions made reference to specific matters of aggravation but made no express finding about those matters. In the present case the Applicant submits that his Honour’s reasons were defective by failing to identify which matters of aggravation he had considered. It was also submitted, perhaps in the alternative, that the Court should infer that he had accepted the Crown submissions on the substantial degree of harm. 
     
      
    35 Again the Applicant relies on the same observations made in the course of submissions, but on this occasion by the Crown, rather than by his Honour. Particular reliance was placed on the Crown submissions that substantial harm would be caused to the victims. This is an aggravating factor within s21A(2)(g). 
     
      
    36 The obligation to give reasons requires a sentencing judge to identify which matters have been taken into account. I have already indicated that.  
     
      
    37 But in my opinion, there is no proper basis for the inference in this case that his Honour must have accepted the Crown submissions of substantial harm. I am not minded to follow the observations of Hunt AJA said in Wilson at [42] what would “usually” occur in an appellate court in this regard. This Court should not infer that his Honour did act on the basis of the submissions of substantial harm but failed to state his reasons.  
     
      
    38 In any event, I should observe that his Honour would have been entitled to act on the basis that there was a substantial harm. 
     
      
    39 The Applicant referred to R v Muldoon an unreported decision of this Court of 13 December 1990. In that case observations were made by Hunt J, as his Honour then was, concerning the kind of evidence that should be adduced in order to conclude what impact there would be by way of future harm to very young children who had been the subject of sexual abuse. The most significant thing about this judgment is its date. Unfortunately, over the last few years, the public and the courts have become much more aware of, and knowledgeable about, the effects of child sexual abuse. His Honour’s observations in Muldoon are of no assistance today. 
     
      
    40 In my opinion, the Crown in its submissions, and his Honour in the exercise of the sentencing discretion, would have been entitled to proceed on the basis that there was a substantial risk of emotional harm arising from the Applicant’s conduct. In any event, as I have noted, the psychologist’s report in this case accepted effects of the very character discussed in Muldoon. 
     
      
    41 In my opinion, the orders of the Court should be leave to appeal granted, the appeal dismissed. 
     
      
    42 SIMPSON J: I agree. 
     
      
    43 HARRISON J: I also agree. 
     
      
    44 SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders of the Court are as I have indicated.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant pleaded guilty to an offence in breach of s 113(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 being that: 
     
      
       
        
        “On 1 September 2005 at Darling Point in the State of New South Wales, did break and enter a garage, the property of Patricia Ward at 44 Mona Road, Darling Point, with intent to commit a serious indictable offence inside that garage, to wit to steal from the said Patricia Ward.” 
        
       
      
    2 The offence carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. The applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of two years and a head sentence of three and a half years. 
     
      
    3 When sentenced the applicant asked that three further offences listed on a Form 1 be taken into account pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999; 
     
      
       
      1. maliciously destroy/damage property, to wit, a garage door lock the property of Nick Scali; 
       
       
      2. malicious destroy/damage property, to wit, a garage door lock the property of Peter Tsu; 
       
       
      3. possess an implement of housebreaking. 
       
      
    4 Each of the offences on the Form 1 was committed on 1 September 2005 at the same garage complex as the subject offence. 
     
      
    5 The applicant was arrested at the scene and charged with the offence of aggravated break and enter with intent (in company) in breach of s 113(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, two counts of malicious damage and one count of possession of a housebreaking implement. 
     
      
    6 On 29 November 2005 the applicant entered a plea of not guilty to the count of aggravate break and enter with intent (in company) but guilty to the other three matters. He was committed for trial. However, on 26 June 2006 the Crown accepted a plea of guilty to the offence of break and enter with intent pursuant to s 113(1) of the Crimes Act and on 27 June 2006 he was arraigned on that charge. 
     
      
    7 At the time of the commission of these offences the applicant was on parole in respect of an offence of aggravated, break enter and steal. He had been convicted of that offence on 8 July 2005 and sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months to date from 30 November 2004 and to expire on 29 May 2006 with a non-parole period of 9 months to expire on 29 August 2005. The applicant had been released to parole on that day being 3 days before he committed the offences the subject of this application. 
     
      
    8 On 16 September 2005 the Parole Board revoked the applicant’s parole order and ordered that he serve the balance of his parole being 8 months and 29 days to date from 2 September 2005 and to expire on 30 May 2006. The sentence imposed by the sentencing judge in the present matter was made wholly cumulative on the sentence for the previous offences. 
     
      
    9 The sentencing judge described the circumstances of the applicant’s offence in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “I now turn to the facts which have been tendered without objection. They are at about 8.40 pm on 1 September 2005 a Ms Ward returned home and approached the car park of the unit in Mona Road, Darling Point. As she walked up the driveway towards the main roller door of the car park she saw a light on and heard voices coming from inside. Ms Ward was about two metres from the roller door looking inside the garage area at four separate garages when she heard male voices coming from the direction of the garage that was closer to the main entrance roller door, that is garage number 3. When Ms Ward looked in this direction she saw the offender, that is the offender before me, standing in the middle of the roller door of the garage. She also saw another person called Liest (?) standing on the left hand side of the unit, holding onto the bottom of the door and pulling up and opening the door. Upon seeing these men Ms Ward went upstairs to her unit and telephoned the owner of garage 3, a Mr Scali (?), to tell him that she thought ‘some guys are breaking into your garage.’ Mr Scali then called the police. The police attended the premises in response to Mr Scali’s call and upon arrival went direct to the garage entrance to the complex which is located at the rear of Loftus Street, Darling Point. The police observed that the main roller door of the garage complex was partially opened and a red light alarm was flashing on a wall near the gate. On closer inspection of internal garage area revealed three of the individual garage doors had been damaged, the locks having been broken. The police approached the gate and saw both offenders coming out of the garage number 3 inside the complex which was partly opened. The police noted the gap was about sixteen to seventeen centimetres between the driveway and the mesh style roller door. The police called out to the offenders ‘don’t move, police.’ The offenders began to walk away from the police towards a corridor leading to the exit of the building. The police apprehended both offenders after a short pursuit. The offender Sharp said he was merely going to urinate, that is where he was going. A search of the offender before me revealed a sharp plastic handled Mahini (?) brand metallic spike. This implement was used to break the locks in the garages inside the complex. Both offenders were conveyed to the police station and introduced to the custody manager. Ms Ward came downstairs in the car park area to observe that her garage door was up, the lock was broken and that a blanket which covered some boxed in her garage was lying on the floor. One of those boxes contained a car stereo, another a video camera. Both have been moved from the upper shelf and placed in a filing cabinet in the middle of the garage door. Mr Scalie observed that his own garage door was open and the lock broken, but that no property had been taken. A third resident Mr Tsu was not present at the time of the incident but later confirmed damage to his garage door. The damage to the garages belonging to Messrs Scali and Tsu is the subject of the matters on the Form 1. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender before me participated in an electronic record of interview and he admitted to being found at the location of 44 Mona Road, Darling Point and being inside the garage number 3. All the property was recovered and accounted for.” 
        
       
       
      Ground 1 - That the learned sentencing judge erred in law by applying a finding that the applicant offended whilst in company as an aggravating factor, as a more serious offence than that charged as constituted by such a finding. 
       
      
    10 The Crown accepted that an error has occurred. In his remarks on sentence his Honour said when setting out aggravating factors of the applicant’s criminal history: 
     
      
       
        
        “In aggravation, the offender has a considerable record going back to the Children’s Court, including robbery in company. The offence in the matter before me was also committed whilst the offender was in company with another.” 
        
       
      
    11 Later his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offence involves an interference with the property of others. It was committed in company.  
        
       
      
    12 Later, his Honour remarked: 
     
      
       
        
        “To reflect the level of criminality involved and taking into account the fact that the offence was committed whilst the offender was on conditional liberty and in company, the need for general deterrence and the matters on the Form 1, the appropriate period of non parole is two years to date from 29 May 2006 with a further eighteen months of parole.” 
        
       
      
    13 Although the sentencing judge was required to find the facts relevant to the offences and the circumstances in which they were committed he was obliged to sentence the applicant for the offences to which he had pleaded guilty. An offence contrary to s 113(2) carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment in recognition of the fact that it involves commission of the offence of break, enter and steal in company of another, a more serious offence than when the criminal act is committed alone and for which s 113(1) of the Act provides a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. By having regard to the fact that the offence for which he was being sentenced was committed in company when determining the appropriate penalty his Honour breached the principle discussed by the High Court in The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383. In these circumstances the question which needs to be considered is, whether, notwithstanding that an error has occurred, this Court should intervene (s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912). It is convenient to consider this question together with the second ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 – the sentence imposed is manifestly excessive 
       
      
    14 The applicant accepted that his significant record of break and enter offences and other matters including an offence of robbery in company were matters which were relevant to the appropriate sentence (R v McNaughton (2006) 163 A Crim R 381). In R v Ponfield (1999) 48 NSWLR 327 this Court identified matters going to the seriousness of an offence under s 112 of the Crimes Act similar principles are relevant to the present offence. Some of the matters identified by the court included whether the offender was on conditional liberty on bail or on parole, whether the offender has a prior record particularly for like offences and whether there was multiplicity of offences. Each of these factors was a feature of the present case. As a consequence the need for general and specific deterrence was enhanced. When sentencing the applicant the sentencing judge was required to have regard to the fact that the applicant had demonstrated an attitude of disobedience of the law. His Honour was obliged to give appropriate weight to retribution, personal deterrence and the protection of society (see McNaughton [26]). 
     
      
    15 The applicant was born on 2 March 1981 and is now aged 26. His criminal history is significant. He became a State ward at the age of 18 months and his upbringing took place in State run centres with placements in foster care. He exhibited behavioural problems in his early life including acts of physical aggression and stealing and has a record of previous convictions which extends from 1995 in the Children’s Court. They include offences for malicious damage, larceny, assault, possession of housebreaking implements, possession of prohibited drugs, the stealing of motor vehicles, robbery in company, supply prohibited drug and a variety of other offences. Although when sentenced for some of these offences, the sentencing judge has attempted to provide sentences in the hope of the applicant’s rehabilitation, those hopes have been repeatedly dashed. As in the present case the applicant has persistently offended when he has been in the community on conditional liberty. The applicant developed a dependency on drugs and has used heroin and cocaine. 
     
      
    16 The sentencing judge found that the offence for which the applicant was being sentenced, although objectively serious, fell towards the lower end of the appropriate scale of objective seriousness. Although I share that view his Honour was also required to have regard to the matters on the Form 1.  
     
      
    17 Since being taken into custody the applicant has exhibited some awareness of the seriousness of his offending and recognised the fact that his drug and alcohol habits have led him to a life of almost continuous crime. Although he has indicated an intention to attempt to rehabilitate himself his past record does not allow confidence that this will occur. However, the sentencing judge was prepared to find special circumstances to enable a more lengthy period of probation to assist the applicant in his stated objective of rehabilitation. These may be considered generous findings. 
     
      
    18 My scepticism in relation to this matter is reinforced by his Honour’s finding that in custody the offender has revealed, according to the probation and parole report, that he neither accepts nor understands reasonable directions and has committed a number of disciplinary breaches. As I said earlier the offender had been released on parole when he committed this offence. The applicant has, without objection, read an affidavit which contains a record of some of his accomplishments since his present incarceration. It does provide some, although limited, hope that upon completing his present term of imprisonment he may reform his behaviour. His counsel also addressed attention to the relevant sentencing statistics and emphasised that the sentence imposed was not towards the lower end of the range and indeed maybe at the higher end. 
     
      
    19 Although I accept that the objective seriousness of the offence was at the lower end of the scale, the applicant’s subjective circumstances were, as I have indicated, not favourable. In my opinion, notwithstanding the error which his Honour made, having regard to all of the relevant matters, the sentence is not such as to require the intervention of this Court. The sentence may be considered stern but in my opinion no other sentence was required by law. 
     
      
    20 Accordingly, although I would grant leave to appeal I would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    21 HISLOP J: I agree. 
     
      
    22 SMART AJ: I also agree. 
     
      
    23 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: Accordingly, the orders of the court are as I have indicated.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Grove J. 
     
      
    2 GROVE J: The applicant appeared for sentence before Tupman DCJ at Sydney District Court where he adhered to a plea of guilty previously made in the Local Court to a charge of conspiracy to import a traffickable quantity of a prohibited drug (cocaine). He was sentenced to imprisonment for three years and ordered to be released on recognizance after serving eighteen months thereof. The scheduled release date is 18 July 2008. 
     
      
    3 At the relevant time the applicant was aged thirty seven and his sister (Nancy) aged thirty three. They were born in England. The applicant acquired Australian citizenship but returned for a time to the United Kingdom and then re-entered Australia in October 2005. His sister, who remained a British citizen, lived in the United Kingdom. 
     
      
    4 As her Honour found, the applicant was a person who used drugs and alcohol and had an addictive personality but otherwise was well regarded, a good employee and a reliable person. He persuaded his sister to become involved in sending him cocaine from the United Kingdom. There was a suggestion that it was cheaper there. The method of transporting the drug was described as unsophisticated. Nancy posted greeting cards containing the drug. They were sent to Nick Kirby, a false name assumed by the applicant, to an address connected with him. In all some eleven cards were despatched. 
     
      
    5 Police investigation had been instituted and telephone calls were lawfully intercepted as well as two of the cards. Her Honour found that a gross amount of 70.4 grams estimated as 32.4 grams pure cocaine was imported. The applicant used some of the drug to feed his own habit and sold some to friends and work colleagues and used some for rent payment. He had sent $1900 to his sister in order to fund purchases. The enterprise was terminated before the applicant was arrested because he feared discovery and had seen a newspaper headline about a person being sentenced to ten years imprisonment for importing drugs into Australia.  
     
      
    6 The applicant has filed a single ground of appeal, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        “The sentencing judge erred by failing to demonstrably take into account the pre-sentence custody and backdate the sentence accordingly.” 
        
       
      
    7 The pre-sentence custody totalled five weeks and extended from 22 February 2006 to 29 March 2006. In reference to both the applicant and his sister her Honour referred to each of them having spent five and half weeks in custody on two occasions during her remarks on sentence and on the third occasion, in reference to the applicant, she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… it seems to me that so far as Mr Starmer is concerned an overall term of imprisonment of three years is called for. That is the term that I propose to set. I will be setting a recognisance release order that comes into effect eighteen months after the commencement of the sentence date, that is something in the nature of a non-parole period. I have chosen that length which may be perceived to be somewhat shorter than the norm, taking into account the fact that he has already spent five and a half weeks in custody, bail refused which I do not propose otherwise to incorporate into the sentence.” 
        
       
      
    8 Accordingly, the sentence was directed to commence on the date of imposition, 19 January 2007, the applicant having been on liberty on bail after 29 March 2006 until then.  
     
      
    9 The comprehensive submission on behalf of the applicant was that the sentence should have been directed to commence five weeks prior to 19 January 2007 to give appropriate account to pre-sentence custody. 
     
      
    10 It is well established that it is desirable and preferable sentencing practice to give effect to service of pre-sentence custody exclusively referrable to a sentence then being imposed by backdating the sentence for the equivalent period of that custody: R v McHugh (1985) 1 NSWLR 588. That practice is also desirable when dealing with Federal offences: Assafiri v R [2007] NSWCCA 159. 
     
      
    11 It was observed in McHugh that the desirable practice would promote accuracy of the record. Obviously it would also provide transparency in the process when there is precise backdating. 
     
      
    12 However, it is not obligatory for a sentencing judge to adopt the practice and it does not, viewed in isolation, demonstrate error to depart from it. Counsel for the applicant has pointed to cases where this Court has intervened, but in all of them the sentencing proceedings were detected to have been affected by ambiguity so that it was not clearly demonstrated that appropriate account had been given to service of pre-sentence custody; R v Nasher [2005] NSWCCA 238; R v Hall [2005] NSWCCA 217; R v Howard [2001] NSWCCA 309. 
     
      
    13 In order to attract intervention by this Court it is necessary to show that relevant error has occurred. On some occasions this can be detected by analysis of the sentence structure in terms of ingredient periods and ultimate result but this is not always the case. The task of the sentencing judge is one of assessment and not one of simple arithmetical calculation. There is no requirement for judges to sentence only in “round figures”.  
     
      
    14 It is important that, in this case, her Honour expressly referred to setting a non-parole period “somewhat shorter than the norm” to take into account the pre-sentence custody. I do not doubt that the “norm” to which her Honour referred was the generally applied proportion between non-parole period and head sentence for Federal offences of between 60 and 66 percent, which has been stipulated in judgments of this Court: R v Bernier [1998] 102 A Crim R 44; R v Viana [2001] NSWCCA 171. 
     
      
    15 Had her Honour fixed a non-parole period in the range just mentioned, it would have lain between 21.6 months and 23.76 months of custody which, even at the lower end, indicates that somewhat more than five weeks reduction had been allowed.  
     
      
    16 Her Honour expressly stated that she made the allowance. The calculations just made show that it was not inadequate. It was not demonstrated that her Honour overlooked any relevant matter nor that there was any error in setting the term. 
     
      
    17 I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    18 SIMPSON J: I agree. 
     
      
    19 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The orders of the Court are as Grove J indicated.

     Judgment 
    1 SIMPSON J: The appellant appeals against his conviction of a single count of aggravated indecent assault. He was formally convicted of that offence by Knight DCJ on 25 September 2006, following his plea of guilty to the charge, which appeared as an alternative count on an indictment. The Crown accepted the plea in full satisfaction of the indictment. On that basis Knight DCJ formally entered the conviction. 
     
      
    2 The appellant was sentenced on 25 September 2007 to a term of imprisonment for 2 years and 9 months commencing 14 June 2007, the non-parole period of which will expire on 13 June 2008. 
     
      
    3 Notwithstanding that the appellant entered a plea of guilty to the charge, he now appeals against conviction, and the Crown concedes that the circumstances are such that the appeal ought to be allowed and the conviction quashed. 
     
      
    4 Having considered all of the circumstances, I am satisfied that the Crown concession is correctly made. The relevant circumstances may therefore be stated briefly. 
     
      
    5 The charge arose out of events which occurred on 10 March 2005. The appellant was then 50 years of age. The complainant, PT, was 22 years of age and suffered from cerebral palsy. He had both physical and intellectual impairment. 
     
      
    6 The appellant and the complainant became acquainted through their attendance at a Blue Mountains church. According to an agreed statement of facts that was placed before the sentencing judge, and which was finalised following extensive negotiations, the appellant invited the complainant to his home for lunch. Once inside, the appellant locked the door and provided lunch to the complainant. The complainant asked to use the toilet and the appellant led him towards it but diverted the complainant into his bedroom where he unzipped the complainant’s pants and began to fondle his penis and testicles. This, according to the statement of facts, was done despite protests by the complainant. The complainant then left the unit. 
     
      
    7 A few days later he reported the incident to a woman who supervised a “Living Skills Course” which he attended and she, in turn, notified the complainant’s father. The complainant’s father and the complainant went to the police station and reported the incident. 
     
      
    8 The appellant was arrested on 22 April 2005 but declined to respond to questions about the allegations. 
     
      
    9 On 9 September 2007 English DCJ imposed the sentence I have mentioned above. 
     
      
    10 Prior to that date the complainant retracted his allegation against the appellant to the extent that he had asserted that the sexual activity between them was non-consensual. On or about 4 September 2007, he contacted the police officer in charge of the prosecution in order to retract the allegation. The police officer notified the solicitor from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions who was handling the prosecution. A conference was arranged, which was attended by the complainant, and two solicitors from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The complainant confirmed that there had been sexual activity between the two, but now said that it had been consensual. 
     
      
    11 English DCJ was informed but took the view that, since a conviction had already been entered by Knight DCJ, she was powerless to do other than proceed to sentence. 
     
      
    12 Whether that is the correct view of the law or not is of no present consequence. 
     
      
    13 That the appellant entered a plea of guilty is a consideration. However, that plea was entered after negotiations, the appellant having initially been charged with three offences. It is, in my opinion, beyond question that, in these circumstances, the appeal must be allowed and the conviction quashed. I would formally order a new trial, although whether there is to be a further trial is, of course, a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions. 
     
      
    14 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      (1) Appeal allowed; 
       
      
     (2) Conviction and sentence quashed; 
     
      
     (3) There be a new trial. 
     
      
    15 MCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree. 
     
      
    16 PRICE J: I also agree.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Donovan DCJ in the Sydney District Court. The applicant had been committed for sentence following his plea of guilty to a single count of robbery. His Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of two years and a balance term of two years. The commencing date of sentence was specified as 21 February 2006 and the first date of eligibility for parole will be 20 February 2008. 
     
      
    2 There is no challenge to the facts found by his Honour. On the afternoon of Tuesday 21 February 2006 a Ms Wong, the catering manager at the University of Technology was balancing the daily takings. She locked the door to the room and opened the safe. There was approximately $2,300 in the safe and a further amount on the table of $2,500 which she was counting. 
     
      
    3 There was a knock on the door which she ignored. The knocking continued and became more persistent and, believing that it was a member of staff Ms Wong opened the door slightly and was confronted by the applicant who had pulled up a t-shirt to cover the lower part of his face. He pushed into the room and demanded money. Ms Wong reacted by pushing the safe door closed and dropping the handle which had the effect of locking it. In a threatening tone the applicant demanded to know the combination but Ms Wong responded that her boss knew the combination and would need to open it for her. Thereupon the applicant took the money which was on the table and started to leave the room. In fact, security guards had been alerted to the presence of the applicant on the campus and Ms Wong saw them and called to them to detain the applicant. They did so and after a brief struggle placed him on the ground.  
     
      
    4 The applicant was arrested and has been in custody since that date. Currency in various denominations totalling $2,480 was recovered.  
     
      
    5 The applicant is an aboriginal male now aged thirty two years. The learned sentencing judge recounted aspects of turbulence in his early life and his move to his grandmother’s home when aged thirteen. Since 1995 he has been in a stable relationship and the couple have two children aged seven and two. His partner assists in caring for his grandmother.  
     
      
    6 Two grounds of appeal are raised.  
     
      
       
        
        “Ground 1. His Honour erred in regarding his record of previous convictions as an aggravating factor in relation to the offence.” 
        
       
      
    7 The applicant has a not inconsiderable prior record. In his remarks, his Honour summarized relevant ingredients in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “He has a record from the Children’s Court and from 1993 his criminal record in the adult courts commenced including five counts of robbery in 1994, a robbery while armed in 1998 and his most recent period of imprisonment was a sentence of twelve months commencing on 16 April 2004 for tamper with evidence with intent to mislead a judicial tribunal. There are a number of other matters but they are not as serious as the ones that I have mentioned.” 
        
       
      
    8 His Honour further noted that in the past the applicant had failed to complete work required pursuant to community service orders and had been the subject of parole revocation on more than one occasion.  
     
      
    9 The complaint encapsulated by this ground is focussed upon a mention of the applicant’s record of prior convictions in this context: 
     
      
       
        
        “There are some aggravating factors. The offence involved threatened use of violence but I also note that that is within the offence itself. He has a record of previous convictions. There was significant injury and fear caused to the victim, even though no property or money ultimately was lost.” 
        
       
      
    10 There is no indication that the sentence assessed by his Honour was in any way increased by reason of this observation. His Honour did not elaborate beyond what appears to be a simple and accurate remark that the applicant does have a record of previous convictions. It is true that when there is an assertion of error what should primarily be looked at are the remarks of the sentencing judge, rather than exchanges during the course of the sentencing proceedings.  
     
      
    11 In the appeal the Crown sought to draw attention to some of these exchanges and, in further response, counsel for the applicant took us to a number of decisions of this Court. In R v Pham [2005] NSWCCA 94 the then Chief Judge at Common Law, Wood J, said, amongst other things, in reference to such exchanges that ""normally this Court will not find an error of principle from interchanges between the Bench and counsel.""  
     
      
    12 In R v Kain [2004] NSWCCA 143 Levine J said:  
     
      
       
        
        “Whether error was made is determined by considering the evidence and the remarks on sentence. There is little practical utility in considering the to-ing and fro-ing between the Bench and counsel during the course of submissions on sentence"".  
        
       
      
    13 And finally, we were referred to the decision in R v A [2004] NSWCCA 292 where again Wood J said: ""Transparency in sentencing is necessary"" and added: ""It would not be safe to assume that some observations passed by a judge during submissions necessarily represents a considered or final view"". None of these cases, of course, say that such exchanges can never be looked at or never be useful. 14 In this case, in the absence of any elaboration, it is significant to note that there was an express exchange at some length between his Honour and counsel in which he made it clear that he regarded the existence of the record as limiting the leniency which might be extended to the applicant. Approached in that way he breached no principle of sentencing practice: Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465; R v McNaughton [2006] 66 NSWLR 566. 
     
      
    15 This ground of appeal is not made out. 
     
      
    16 Ground 2: His Honour’s determination of the appropriate sentence was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    17 Counsel has drawn attention to statistics collected by the Judicial Commission. It is submitted that they do not represent precedents so much as an assistance as to what might be regarded as a permissible range. Whilst caution should be exercised in the use of these statistics, it is clear that the present sentence is well within the pattern which exists for impositions in respect of this crime.  
     
      
    18 It is submitted that the sentence is beyond the appropriate range if there be taken into account the plea at the earliest opportunity, contrition, the circumstances of the offence and the prospects of rehabilitation.  
     
      
    19 For my part, I would have some difficulty in assessing the circumstances of the offence as providing a matter of mitigation. His Honour observed that the applicant was affected by drugs at the time and he claimed that he had no real memory of what he did. I do not overlook his Honour’s finding that the applicant had prospects of rehabilitation. The finding is not the subject of challenge, although it might be said to have been somewhat generous bearing in mind the observations earlier made by his Honour concerning the applicant’s failure to complete community service and having been more than once the subject of parole revocation. 
     
      
    20 In my view the sentence was well within the range of appropriate imposition and no less severe a sentence was warranted. 
     
      
    21 I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    22 HULME J: I agree with the order proposed and with his Honour’s reasons. 
     
      
    23 SIMPSON J: I also agree. 
     
      
    24 GROVE J: The order of the Court will be as I have proposed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Berman DCJ at Sydney District Court. The applicant pleaded guilty to two counts, the first charging an ongoing supply of prohibited drug and the second charging supply of a prohibited drug. In each case the relevant drug was methylamphetamine. The prescribed maximum penalties for those offences are 20 years and 15 years imprisonment respectively. 
     
      
    2 His Honour sentenced the applicant on count 1 to imprisonment for 12 months commencing on 27 August 2008 and expiring on 26 August 2009 with a balance term of 12 months and on count 2 to a fixed term of 12 months imprisonment commencing on 27 February 2008 and expiring on 26 February 2009. 
     
      
    3 In May 2007 authority was granted for a controlled operation to investigate the supply of drugs by the applicant. On 27 June an undercover officer (UCO) contacted him by telephone. On 28 June they met at the Bayview Hotel at Gladesville. Another person Benjamin McDonald was present. The applicant supplied the UCO with 3.3 grams of drug for $400. Further contacts resulted in supplies by the applicant of 3.1 grams for $450 on 12 July at a McDonalds Restaurant, Ryde and 3.2 grams for $450 on 19 July at the same location. These three supplies constituted the ongoing supply charged in count 1.  
     
      
    4 At this lastmentioned meeting conversation took place between the applicant and the UCO: 
     
      
       
        
        “UCO: What’s the chances of getting an ounce? 
        
       
       
        
        Applicant: Of base? 
        
       
       
        
        UCO: Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Applicant: Yeah, easy. 
        
       
       
        
        UCO: Yeah, easy, how much for that? 
        
       
       
        
        Applicant: Um, about twenty-five. 
        
       
       
        
        UCO: Twenty five. 
        
       
       
        
        Applicant: Twenty five hundred. 
        
       
       
        
        UCO: Mates discount, nuh just jokes. 
        
       
       
        
        Applicant: Um, yeah, about twenty five hundred, let me clarify  
        
       
        
      with him though.” 
       
      
    5 On 25 July further conversation took place between them: 
     
      
       
        
        “UCO: I was still after the one if that is OK. 
        
       
       
        
        Applicant: Shouldn’t be a problem, I will have to make a  
         
          
           
            
            couple of phone calls and get back to you in about an hour. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        UCO: Did you manage to do some number crunching or is it still twenty five? 
        
       
       
        
        Applicant: Yeah it is still the twenty five.” 
         
         
        
       
      
    6 On 27 July the UCO tried unsuccessfully to contact the applicant, however at about 3 pm Benjamin McDonald contacted him and said that he would be able to supply an ounce of amphetamine on behalf of the applicant who had come down with an illness. The next day the UCO and McDonald met at Stanmore where 24 grams were supplied for $2,200. McDonald was thereupon arrested and later police arrested the applicant at his parents’ home where he was residing at the time. 
     
      
    7 The applicant has filed two grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 
       
       
      The Sentencing Judge erred in the way he took into account his finding that the Applicant was partially motivated to supply drugs to assist a friend. 
       
      
    8 The applicant gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings. He claimed that the main reason he became involved in the illicit trafficking was to help his friend McDonald’s financial problems. The other reason was to obtain supplies for his own use, in effect, for nothing. 
     
      
    9 The applicant relied upon a passage which in written submissions had been extracted from his Honour’s remarks on sentence. The passage needs to be understood in its full context and only the final two sentences were quoted in the submission. The full context is: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender is a person who has done much good in the world. He has, as I said, supported his daughter. He has been gainfully employed since leaving school and he apparently is good at his job. On the other hand, he did decide in the middle of last year to become a drug dealer. He said that this motive for offending was twofold. That he would get his drugs to use recreationally for free but also he was going to help Mr McDonald who was going through financial difficulties at the time. There is something of a paradox here, however, Mr McDonald’s financial circumstances were unlikely to be significantly improved by any small scale drug dealing. The offender’s motivation for helping his friend must have included a motivation to sell many more drugs than he actually did. He was really only going to help Mr McDonald if he got involved in drug supply at a much deeper level than that for which he is to be sentenced today. It is for this reason that he was prepared to use his IT sales skills when speaking to the undercover officer in order to sell more drugs. So although the offender seeks to rely on the circumstance that he was trying to help Mr McDonald, the fact that he could only really help Mr McDonald by becoming a serious and larger scale drug dealer is something which actually counts against him. It illustrates the offender’s preparedness to supply drugs at a much more significant level and that in turn illustrates his character, at least in the middle of last year.” 
        
       
      
    10 The Crown submission was that, in full context, his Honour was doing no more than acknowledging the extent of the applicant’s preparedness to act out of character. Obviously the applicant would have to engage in more than a few small deals to alleviate McDonald’s financial problems. The applicant had agreed with this in answer to some questions by his Honour when he gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You say you sold it for $450, it’s not really going to solve Mr McDonald’s financial problems unless there’s a great many more supplies taking place, is there? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No, that’s correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I’m still puzzled as to why you did it then. You weren’t going to solve Mr McDonald’s financial problems, so what was the benefit of doing it to anyone? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Probably the use of the drugs. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So it didn’t really have much to do with Mr McDonald’s financial problems at all, did it? 
        
       
       
        
        A. It was helping somewhat. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well, Mr McDonald was using drugs, wasn’t he? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I believe so, yes, yes, he was. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So was he spending his profit on drugs just the same as you were? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I don’t think – I don’t think so. We were only given it by week to week, covering his bills week to week.” 
        
       
      
    11 His Honour did not err as contended by this ground and I would reject the applicant’s contention. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 
       
       
      The Applicant has a legitimate grievance arising from disparity of sentence with Benjamin McDonald. 
       
      
    12 McDonald had already been sentenced by another judge (English DCJ) when the applicant appeared. Berman DCJ had her Honour’s remarks on sentence and he noted the contradiction in the evidence before him in the sense that the applicant placed blame on McDonald because he intended to help McDonald’s finances and the evidence before English DCJ, during which McDonald effectively blamed the applicant for whom he was doing a favour on account of the applicant’s then current illness. McDonald received the sentence of 17 months imprisonment which was suspended pursuant to s 12 of the sentencing legislation. 
     
      
    13 Irrespective of the contest, it needs to be observed that McDonald was not alleged to be involved in the more serious offence of ongoing supply which carried the longer possible maximum sentence. Importantly, Berman DCJ accepted as a matter of contrast, that McDonald’s offence which was the same offence as charged in count 2 against the applicant, was, as English DCJ had found, a “one-off” offence whereas the applicant had been engaged in ongoing supply.  
     
      
    14 For reasons which he expressed, his Honour gave the applicant a benefit of the doubt regarding his having second thoughts about the conduct which constituted count 2, however, the offence was in fact committed and the applicant by his plea, acknowledged his guilty participation. 
     
      
    15 In broad terms, the applicant was sentenced for a pattern of offending whereas McDonald was sentenced for a single instance of criminality. 
     
      
    16 His Honour gave the applicant full measure of mitigation for the subjective matters advanced in his favour. The applicant has no justifiable grievance arising from the sentences received by him for his offending and that received by McDonald for his single offence. 
     
      
    17 There was no demonstrable error in his Honour’s exercise of his discretion to determine that the sentences on count 1 and 2 be not served fully concurrently. The submission was made orally to the Court that there should have been some further adjustment in order to achieve parity between the 17 months assessed as the sentence (before suspension) received by McDonald and the 12 months fixed term received by the applicant. When analysis is made, in fact additional time to be served which has been visited upon the applicant on count 2 amounts to just 6 months. In my view that sufficiently allows for any concept of parity between the two offenders. There was nothing derived from parity as contended by senior counsel which should cause this Court to intervene. 
     
      
    18 I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    19 CAMPBELL JA: I agree. 
     
      
    20 HOWIE J: I agree. 
     
      
    21 CAMPBELL JA: The orders of the Court will therefore be as proposed by Justice Grove.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: The Court is in a position to give judgment and I will ask Grove J to give the first judgment. 
     
      
    2 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence following conviction of the applicant at trial in Albury District Court on an indictment charging an attempt to possess imported narcotic goods namely a quantity of cocaine. The goods weighed 408.1 grams and had a nett purity of 296.9 grams. She was sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years with a non parole period of 6 years. The ground of appeal is that the sentence is manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    3 The facts were summarized by Nield DCJ in his remarks on sentence. I draw from them for this abbreviated narration. During 2002 the applicant resided in Albury and became acquainted with a man of Nigerian origin who called himself Thomas on an internet chat line. Subsequently Thomas travelled to Albury and from time to time over the next few years they had personal as well as internet contact.  
     
      
    4 Thomas asked the applicant to assist him in receiving packages which she claimed she believed contained materials which would help Africans have a better life in Australia. She claimed to have been assured by Thomas that the packages contained nothing associated with terrorism or drugs. In evidence in the sentencing proceedings the applicant continued to maintain that she had no knowledge that there were drugs in the particular package which was the subject of the indictment, but of course, that assertion was inconsistent with the jury verdict upon which his Honour was required to proceed to sentence.  
     
      
    5 During 2004 and 2005 the applicant was involved in arrangements for the reception of four packages, three of which were delivered to her and one to the home of a neighbour. Thomas arrived to collect two of these packages and the other two were forwarded by the applicant to addresses nominated by him. 
     
      
    6 The applicant established an email address in the name of Kylie Fox. On 3 July 2005 a package addressed to Kylie Fox arrived in Australia from Brazil. It contained the cocaine which I have described. It was intercepted by police. Thereafter the package was the subject of a controlled delivery, an expression which is well understood. 
     
      
    7 For the receipt of this package the applicant had been involved in negotiating a short term rental of a flat in Albury. The parcel delivery service had been directed to this address and on the morning of 13 July 2005 the applicant placed a note on the front door indicating that she had been called away urgently and asking that the package be left. The package was brought to the flat by a police officer disguised as a postman and he did not leave the package. However, contact was made with a mobile phone number which had been endorsed on the note on the door and later in the day the applicant was met at the flat by the police officer and she took possession of the package.  
     
      
    8 She removed the labels from the package using a pair of scissors and left the flat and drove to a shopping centre. There she was arrested by police and found in possession of items including the shipping labels which had been taken from the package.  
     
      
    9 After arrest she was interviewed by police and gave a false explanation of events in accordance with a concoction that she had prepared in consultation with Thomas.  
     
      
    10 Thomas has, so far as the evidence reveals, not been identified nor been arrested. The prosecution included material collected in the course of investigation and in particular the electronic messages which had passed between the applicant and Thomas. It suffices to observe that these revealed a knowing and willing participation by the applicant in the arrangements for the receipt of the package and in the activities designed to inhibit detection by the temporary use of the flat and false identities.  
     
      
    11 His Honour made findings concerning the applicant’s background and subjective circumstances. She had worked for a lengthy period in employment with the Australian Taxation Office but suffered a nervous breakdown when seconded to the Commonwealth Employment Service. She accepted voluntary redundancy in 1997 and was placed on a disability pension in 2001. She had been married but was divorced. Her 21 year old daughter resided independently in Melbourne and her 17 year old son resided with his father in Wodonga across the border from where she resided in Albury.  
     
      
    12 The written submissions on behalf of the applicant read, if I may say so with respect, more like submissions on sentence than submissions in support of a contention that the sentencing judge was in error. The submissions are presented under two headings, the first entitled “The Degree of Culpability” and second, “Comparative Cases”. In the circumstances it is convenient to approach the matter by dealing with the various aspects which have been raised under those headings.  
     
      
    13 It is noted that at first instance there were competing submissions concerning the level of the applicant’s participation in what was obviously an importation which involved more participants than simply Thomas and herself. At the very least there had to be someone involved in the consignment from Brazil from whence the package originated. His Honour dealt with the contest and his remarks on sentence included: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the offender’s role in the importation of the cocaine was greater than that of a courier, whereas the offender’s counsel submitted that, however the offender’s role is described, it was at the bottom of the ladder of the hierarchy of drug importation. I agree with the Crown Prosecutor. I consider, having regard to the content of her email transmissions and to what she did, that the offender was more involved in the importation of the cocaine than a courier, with her involvement being determined by what she did.” 
        
       
      
    14 It was in complete harmony with authority that his Honour focussed on what the applicant did. Insofar as there is an implied challenge to this finding it should be rejected. No error has been demonstrated. 
     
      
    15 Allied to this reference to his Honour’s remarks is a submission founded upon the circumstance that at first instance both counsel referred his Honour to the range identified in R v Wong & anor  (1999) 48 NSWLR 340. The range discussed in that case was between 6 and 9 years imprisonment as head sentence. There was a dispute about a written submission by the Crown that the expression of this range applied to pleas of guilty whereas it had been described as applicable either when there had been pleas of guilty or convictions at trial: R v Karacic [2001] NSWCCA 12.  
     
      
    16 In this Court the Crown does not dispute that the prosecutor had said  
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown is not suggesting that the range should be above or beyond that which is set out in  
        Wong 
        . We’re not suggesting that it should be above that but that it is – the range is set in  
        Wong 
         and  
        Leung 
        , it’s a bottom up range in the sense that it’s a reflection of the sentencing patterns to that time and it wasn’t and it should be regarded in that way by your Honour”.  
        
       
      
    17 Whilst I find some obscurities in that transcription, as I have said the essence is not denied. Nevertheless, it was of course for his Honour to determine the sentence and he was not bound by submissions or concessions by either counsel.  
     
      
    18 It is of importance to note that both Wong and Karacic were decided prior to the repeal of s 16G of the Crimes Act 1914 which repeal took effect on 16 January 2003. The Crown referred his Honour to what I had said about s 16G in R v Tsiaousis [2005] NSWCCA 240 namely: 
     
      
       
        
        “The effect of preponderance of authority (to which might also be added  
        R v Dejeu 
         [2004] NSWCCA 237) is that it would be inappropriate to approach the sentencing exercise upon a broad arithmetical approach applying that to some perceived pre repeal pattern of sentencing. Whilst it is acknowledged that the repeal is likely to result in an increase over what might be discerned by reference to any earlier pattern the proper approach remains for a sentencing judge to meet the requirements set out in s 16A (1) of the  
        Crimes Act 
         1914.” 
        
       
      
    19 As to the likely effective increase following repeal of s 16G I can refer also to R v Rivadavia  (2004) 61 NSWLR 63 and the cases cited therein.  
     
      
    20 There is no error derived from any failure of his Honour to limit his sentence within the range discussed in R v Wong.  
     
      
    21 The applicant submits that, notwithstanding his Honour’s finding the applicant had a relatively low status in the importation exercise. As earlier stated, his Honour’s approach of considering what the evidence showed that the applicant had done rather than seeking to establish a position in the drug importation hierarchy was a correct approach. 
     
      
    22 Complaint is made that his Honour did not state that he had taken the applicant’s prior good character into account. His Honour twice stated in his remarks that the applicant had an unblemished character before the commission of the subject offence and in making those statements he was obviously indicating that he was taking it into account. He was not obliged to engage in some ritual incantation that he had taken it into account.  
     
      
    23 Further complaint is made that his Honour’s observation that he suspected that the applicant’s reward would have been greater than the amounts of money that she received from Thomas is demonstrative of error. The amounts of money received from Thomas were comparatively small and part of it appears to have been used to pay the rent on the flat to which delivery was made. His Honour was doing no more than candidly expressing the suspicion which he held but he had qualified that by expressly finding that the evidence did not allow him to say what the applicant was to receive for her participation. The expression of the suspicion was not a finding and there is no basis for concluding that he weighed that suspicion as an adverse fact in assessing the sentence for the applicant.  
     
      
    24 There were, however, a number of matters which his Honour expressly said that he was taking into account in the applicant’s favour. Although the applicant denied her knowledge concerning the narcotic content of the package, she made considerable admissions as to fact which were incorporated in a lengthy statement of agreed facts which undoubtedly shortened the trial considerably with obvious benefit to the administration of justice. His Honour expressly accepted a submission that for this the applicant was entitled to a discount in penalty. He stated that she was entitled to a further discount by reason of having been subjected to particularly onerous conditions of bail. She was required to report twice daily and his Honour referred to restrictions on her movement and lifestyle, such restrictions included a curfew and, as she testified in the sentencing proceedings, prevention from crossing the border into the town of Wodonga where her 17 year old son was residing with her ex husband. Although her children had resided with her former husband after their divorce, she maintained a good relationship with them.  
     
      
    25 Further, his Honour found that the applicant had learned a salutary lesson from doing what she did and was satisfied that she had excellent prospects for rehabilitation and was unlikely to reoffend. He repeated at this point his reference to her previously unblemished character. 
     
      
    26 Whilst I accept that his Honour did take these matters into account as he stated he would, it is difficult to perceive that these factors received reflection in sentence as ultimately assessed to the level which they merited. 
     
      
    27 Both counsel have taken the Court to a series of cases for the purpose of comparison. For reasons which I have adumbrated earlier I find little assistance to be derived from assessments made prior to the repeal of s 16G of the Crimes Act. What can be observed is that the sentence imposed upon the applicant impresses as markedly higher than the preponderance of the cases assembled for the purpose of comparison. The detail of subjective circumstances in particular of course varies from offender to offender but when it is considered that the applicant was entitled to significant weight for the matters which his Honour found in her favour I am persuaded that what appears by comparison to be, to say the least, upper end range sentence received by the applicant is manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    28 On the potential issue of resentence the Court has the benefit of an affidavit from the applicant showing that she has, whilst in custody, fulfilled the promise that his Honour predicted in relation to progress towards rehabilitation and that circumstance is thereby enhanced in the weight that should be accorded to it.  
     
      
    29 I propose that the application for leave to appeal against sentence be granted and the appeal allowed, and the sentence in the District Court quashed. 
     
      
    30 In lieu thereof the applicant be sentenced to imprisonment for 8 years commencing on 14 October 2006 with a non parole period of 4 years 9 months commencing on that date.  
     
      
    31 The Court is required to ensure that the effect of setting a non parole period is explained to the applicant and I would direct the legal representatives of the applicant to discharge that duty. 
     
      
    32 BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Grove J. 
     
      
    33 HIDDEN J: I agree with Grove J. 
     
      
    34 BEAZLEY JA: The orders of the Court will be those proposed by Grove J.

     Leith Gordon BAGSHAW v REGINA (Cth) 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: We have decided to give judgment. I will ask Justice Simpson to deliver the first judgment. 
     
      
    2 SIMPSON J: In these proceedings the applicant, Mr Leith Bagshaw, seeks leave to appeal, under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, against a decision made in the District Court by Berman DCJ on 28 August 2008. I shall set out, as best I can, what I discern to be the relevant circumstances. 
     
      
    3 Mr Bagshaw is charged with 7 offences against s 269 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth). Essentially, the allegations are of obtaining goods, services or credit in contravention of that section. On 10 April 2008 he entered pleas of guilty to 4 of the charges, and pleas of not guilty to the remaining 3. 
     
      
    4 On 30 July 2008, acting without legal representation, Mr Bagshaw filed in the District Court a notice of motion, expressing the orders there sought as: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “1) See Attachments. Seeking Adjournment. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          2) Seeking to be heard by indep. Judge. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          3) Seek orders to have case struck out because of 4 judges comments. Fair Trial.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    5 On 28 August 2008 the notice of motion came on for hearing before Berman DCJ. Mr Bagshaw appeared unrepresented. The transcript of what then transpired is before this Court. It is evident that Berman DCJ had severe difficulty in persuading Mr Bagshaw to give any rational account of his application, or the basis upon which it was made. In the end his Honour treated the notice of motion as an application for a stay of the prosecution, or, alternatively, for adjournment (although, as his Honour recognised, that was scarcely appropriate since no trial date had then been set). 
     
      
    6 Although Mr Bagshaw did, according to the transcript, place before Berman DCJ some documentary evidence, that evidence appears to have had no relevance to the application. Berman DCJ went to considerable lengths to give Mr Bagshaw the opportunity to explain his application, but these efforts went unrewarded. Mr Bagshaw was unable to identify any evidence relevant to the question of whether the prosecution ought to be stayed, or, as a possible alternative, that Berman DCJ ought to decline to fix a trial date.  
     
      
    7 The transcript reveals that the second page of a two-page affidavit was presented in the District Court. That document is also amongst the papers put before this Court. It is by no means apparent that that affidavit was prepared for filing in the District Court application: rather, it contains a suggestion that it was prepared for the purpose of an application in the Federal Court of Australia for annulment of a bankruptcy, presumably the bankruptcy of Mr Bagshaw upon which the criminal charges are founded. 
     
      
    8 In any event, the only matters it contains of any possible relevance to the District Court application were certain assertions that various (mostly unnamed) judges of the District Court (including the Chief Judge) had made what might be considered ill-advised comments, denoting bias against Mr Bagshaw. As Berman DCJ observed, any such comments ought to be proved by an official transcript or recording of the proceedings in which they are alleged to have been made. The presentation of one page of a two-page affidavit is no way to prove that such comments were in fact made. In any event, even if the comments were made, they provide no grounds for a stay, or even delay, of the prosecution. At most, they provide grounds for the disqualification, on the grounds of bias, of the individual judge or judges by whom they were made. I here emphasise, however, with one exception there is no evidentiary basis for a finding that such remarks were in fact made. 
     
      
    9 The exception is this. On the hearing today Mr Bagshaw presented one page of a transcript of 11 July 2005 in which a remark is attributed to the then presiding judge, who is not identified in the transcript. What was there said is not precisely what was attributed to him by Mr Bagshaw in his written submissions, but it is at least possible to identify the source of the allegations made by Mr Bagshaw. 
     
      
    10 Having given Mr Bagshaw every opportunity to present his case, Berman DCJ declined to make orders of the kind sought, and fixed the trial to commence on 3 November 2008. It is this order that is the subject of the present application for leave to appeal. Again, in this Court Mr Bagshaw appeared unrepresented. 
     
      
    11 I should add here that in the District Court Mr Bagshaw signified his intention of seeking leave to withdraw the pleas of guilty to those charges to which he had entered such pleas, but, as at 28 August, no such application had been made. Such an application, we were told, has since been made and is listed for hearing. 
     
      
    12 In the present proceedings Mr Bagshaw has set out what purport to be 11 separate grounds. I do not propose to set them out in full. Rather, their flavour may be obtained from a sample. They include: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “The judge erred - 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          1. failed to address the false taxation document put up by the DPP barristers and forged signatures. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          2. failed to take action under the criminal act or the taxation law. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          9. failed to address the duty of care and oath of the DPP barrister. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          10. failed to address the non performance of DPP in not providing the original documents in the case. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          …” 
          
         
        
       
      
    13 Mr Bagshaw also provided to this Court submissions in writing. Likewise, I do not intend to address these in full. They include: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “Judges (sic) erred 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          1. Judge failed to address the false taxation document – the taxation file number is false as are the signatures. The documents do not exist at the Taxation Dept. The barrister acting for the DPP failed under a duty of care to the court to clarify the documents. The barrister misled the court. The ATO barristers asked the DPP what they were going to do about it and there was no comment. The ATO told the DPP it was a breach of law. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          2. The ATO has requested me to take action under the National Crimes Act as it is a breach of the ATO Act. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          9. There were no original documents submitted to the court under the High Court Act all documents should be original.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    14 Under paragraph 10, Mr Bagshaw gave more purported detail of the remarks he attributed to various judges of the District Court, and named two additional judges said to have made those remarks. There is nothing in these submissions that casts, or is even capable of casting, any doubt upon the correctness of the ruling made by Berman DCJ. Mr Bagshaw’s case did not in any way improve on the presentation of his oral submissions.  
     
      
    15 He provided an affidavit sworn on 7 October. In that, and in oral submissions he made repeated assertions of misconduct on the part of various authorities, including the Director of Public Prosecutions (Commonwealth) or his representatives, in the prosecution of the charges. He challenged the admissibility of documentary evidence intended to be presented in the trial. He sought to rely on aspects of other proceedings, in the Federal Court of Australia, and in the Equity Division of this Court. He made assertions about missing documents unsupported by evidence either in this Court or in the District Court.  
     
      
    16 As was pointed out to Mr Bagshaw, the admissibility of evidence, documentary or otherwise, is a matter for the trial judge. Regrettably, Mr Bagshaw’s presentation of his case betrayed a lack of understanding of the principles applicable to applications under s 5F. He was unable to address the essential issues. 
     
      
    17 Mr Bagshaw at the very conclusion of his submissions advanced one matter which may, if based upon proper evidence, have been seen as a discretionary circumstance relevant to the application in the District Court. However, that was not put to the District Court judge as a reason why the trial should not proceed, was not dealt with by him, and while it can give rise to some sympathy in the Court, it cannot be seen as a reason why Berman DCJ was wrong in the decision that he made. 
     
      
    18 In my opinion there is no basis for interfering with the ruling against which leave to appeal is sought. I would refuse leave to appeal.

      JUDGMENT [No 2] – on application to discharge jury; see p466 of transcript 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Michael Rex Clark has been charged with the murder of Ernest Richard Clark. The murder is said to have been carried out as a result of an agreement between Michael Rex Clark and his son Ben whereby Ben shot the deceased on 29 April 2005 causing injuries which led to his death the following day.  
     
      
    2 The matter has a long history. Michael Clark, the present accused, and his son, Ben, were jointly indicted before Patten AJ in 2007, at which time Ben Clark pleaded guilty to murder. He was later sentenced to 20 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 14 years.  
     
      
    3 The trial then proceeded before Patten AJ and a jury in respect of the indictment concerning Michael Clark, he being charged with murder. Ultimately, the jury was discharged when it was unable to agree.  
     
      
    4 The matter was listed before me on 11 February 2008 for a retrial. It proceeded for 17 days before it became necessary to discharge the jury. A further jury panel was summoned on 10 March 2008 and the present trial began. 
     
      
    5 That trial is now in its tenth day and most of the oral evidence has been called. There remains a significant number of listening device taped material and telephone intercept material before the completion of the Crown case, together with a handful of witnesses. That being the context, the trial was adjourned on Thursday 20 March 2008 for the Easter break. Because of the commitments of counsel, the trial was to resume on Thursday 27 March 2008.  
     
      
    6 Yesterday, that is 26 March 2008, I received a memorandum from the Senior Deputy Registrar of the Supreme Court setting out a conversation which she had had the previous Saturday evening with a person who identified himself as a juror in this trial. That memorandum has been marked for identification 16 and is in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Memorandum 
         
         
        I refer to the trial that is currently before His Honour Justice Kirby. 
         
         
        At a private function on Saturday evening, a person known to me indicated that he is a juror in the above trial. I write to inform you that he disclosed to me that he has been given information that the defendant has been tried on a previous occasion. 
         
         
        As best as I recall, a conversation took place with words to the following effect: 
         
         
        He said: Where are you working now? 
         
         
        I said: I'm working at the Supreme Court. 
         
         
        He said: Is that at Darlinghurst? 
         
         
        I said: No, it's at Queens Square, near St James. 
         
         
        He said: Oh - I'm on the jury in a trial up at Darlinghurst. Before Justice Kirby. 
         
         
        I said: So that would be a trial for murder? 
         
         
        He said: Yes it's a murder trial. 
         
         
        I said: That would be interesting. 
         
         
        He said: Yes it is. 
         
        (Some discussion ensued about him never having been on a jury before, and how long the trial is meant to be going for) 
         
        He's actually been tried before. 
         
         
        I said: What, they told the jury that? 
         
         
        He said: No, some people from church accidentally told me. 
         
         
        I said: Did you tell anyone that you had found that out? (I meant - had he informed the Court) 
         
         
        He said: No. 
         
         
        I said: Well don't tell me any more. 
         
         
        If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. 
         
         
        Joanne Gray 
         
        Senior Deputy Registrar.""  
        
       
      
    7 Upon the trial resuming this morning that memorandum was provided to counsel and the opportunity given to obtain instructions. Instructions having been obtained, the juror with whom the Senior Deputy Registrar had the conversation was then called to give evidence. I should add that I spoke briefly with the Senior Deputy Registrar simply to identify the juror so that he could be segregated from the other jurors and, ultimately, examined if that was appropriate. The instruction to segregate that juror was given to the Sheriff's officer and that was done. He was ultimately called to give evidence and that evidence appears at page 468 and 469 of the transcript. 
     
      
    8 Counsel was again given the opportunity of obtaining instructions and then made submissions.  
     
      
    9 It is Mr Thangaraj's application that the jury should be discharged. He says in the alternative that the particular juror should be discharged and further submits that the separate discretion which would then arise, as to whether the trial should proceed, should be exercised by then discharging the reduced panel of only ten jurors. 
     
      
    10 The basis upon which Mr Thangaraj makes his application for the discharge of the panel or, alternatively, the discharge of the juror and the consequential discharge of the panel, is that the juror was not forthcoming when giving evidence. He, therefore, has no confidence that the juror has been frank as to what he knows. He surmises that he may well know prejudicial material which he is not disclosing and nothing by way of further questioning is likely to elicit such material.  
     
      
    11 The Crown says, on the other hand, that there is no basis for discharging the juror. He acknowledges that to some degree, perhaps to a large degree, he was not forthcoming when originally examined, such that specific questions had to be asked of him before the material that appears in the transcript became available. Nonetheless, he points out that the juror had the stress and the embarrassment of having been segregated from his fellow jurors, together with the knowledge that he had, to some degree, departed from the warnings that had been repeatedly given to him and other jurors that they were not to discuss the trial or the evidence. 
     
      
    12 Dealing with these submissions, when I first read the memorandum my concern was the same concern that had led me to discharge the previous jury, namely, the possibility that highly prejudicial material relating to the accused's criminal record may have come to the notice of the juror. However, it is clear that the accused's past was not an aspect of the conversation between the juror and the officer from the Supreme Court. Nonetheless, there was allusion to a further conversation at Church where something had been said.  
     
      
    13 I am quite satisfied, however, that my early misgivings in this respect were unfounded and that the entire conversation related to the history of this trial.  
     
      
    14 Two issues arise: The first is whether the hunch of counsel for the accused that this witness is concealing prejudicial material from the Court is well founded. The second is, I suppose, the alternative possibility whether one can be reasonably confident that, at the end of the day, this juror has disclosed what he knew, that is, that he is not holding something back. 
     
      
    15 Now, it has to be said that the juror was not forthcoming when initially asked about his discussions with others concerning this trial. I accept, however, that he was embarrassed because he plainly had departed from the warnings that he had repeatedly been given. Although it did require direct questioning, I nonetheless believe that ultimately he provided the Court with such knowledge as he had.  
     
      
    16 It is perhaps instructive to ask: What could he possibly have known that he may have withheld? The answer is, of course, pure speculation. It is possible, I suppose, that it came to his notice from these discussions that the previous jury in the trial before Patten AJ was a hung jury. If that were so, then that would be a matter favourable to the accused, which Mr Thangaraj for the accused, acknowledged.  
     
      
    17 One must, indeed, speculate much further before prejudice could arise that the conversation included jury numbers and the possible view of the particular person who was said to have been on the previous jury. 
     
      
    18 A number things will be noticed about the conversation at Church as related by the juror. First, nothing in the conversation with the Supreme Court officer was prejudicial to the accused. There was a reference to the fact that he knew that there had been a previous trial but that was a matter disclosed to this jury at the very outset of the trial. The only source of possible prejudice must concern the conversation at Church. It appears that one of the Church members was a previous jury member. However, the conversation as related by the witness was a conversation not with that person but his wife, and the juror's wife. I accept the juror's account as ultimately given that when he recognised, having come to the conversation late, that it concerned the same trial, he put an end to the conversation. 
     
      
    19 The juror was asked whether he had spoken to other jury members about his Church conversation. His answer was in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “No, nobody knows about that, no. Hang on; hang on. I'm sorry, I can't remember that. I don't think so but I could have said something; just that I was, that I stopped."" 
        
       
      
    20 The impression I got from that evidence was that he may well have mentioned the coincidence, which is remarkable, that someone from his Church group had been on a previous jury, and that he had put an end to the conversation once that came to his notice.  
     
      
    21 It seems to me, taking all these matters into account, that there is no basis upon which the jury should be discharged; that I should decline to discharge the particular juror and that the third question (as to the discharge of the reduced panel), therefore, does not arise.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SIMPSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed upon him in the District Court on 10 August 2007 by Puckeridge DCJ, following his pleas of guilty to a series of charges on an indictment. The applicant entered pleas of guilty to 3 counts of receiving stolen property, 1 count of disposing of stolen property and 1 of possession of property stolen outside NSW. In addition, he asked, pursuant to Pt 3 Div 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Sentencing Procedure Act”) that an additional 3 counts of the same kind be taken into account, together with an offence of aid and abet having custody of a false instrument (a driver’s licence). 
     
      
    2 On the first count Puckeridge DCJ imposed a fixed term of imprisonment of 1 year and 9 months, commencing on 10 May 2007 and expiring on 9 February 2009. On each of the second, third and fourth counts his Honour imposed sentences of 2 years and 6 months, made up of a non-parole period of 1 year and 4 months, commencing on 10 August 2007 and expiring on 9 December 2008, with a balance of term of 1 year and 2 months, expiring on 9 February 2010. On the fifth count he imposed an identical sentence, but with a commencing date of 10 October 2007; the non-parole period in respect of that sentence therefore expires on 9 February 2009 and the balance of term on 9 April 2010. 
     
      
    3 The overall term of imprisonment to be served by the applicant is a head sentence of 2 years and 11 months, made up of a non-parole period of 1 year and 9 months with a balance of term of 1 year and 2 months. 
     
      
    4 In sentencing as he did his Honour found special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act and varied the ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    5 Since the ground on which the application for leave to appeal is based is extremely narrow, it is not necessary to go into extensive detail about the facts of each offence. The facts disclose that the applicant was the principal of a criminal enterprise which dealt in stolen property. The stolen property included jewellery and other items the proceeds of burglaries and thefts from retail stores. A co-accused was found to be in possession of a false driver’s licence. The enterprise was centred upon a coffee shop of which the applicant was the proprietor. 
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    6 The applicant did not give evidence in the sentencing proceedings. There was before Puckeridge DCJ a pre-sentence report. This showed that the applicant was born in Serbia in March 1962 and migrated to Australia in 1992. He has taken out Australian citizenship. He had some criminal record including, relevantly, offences of dishonesty such as having unlawfully obtained goods in custody and larceny. He has two children aged 19 and 16 from a first marriage, and three step children with his current wife, who lives in Serbia. He has been trying to arrange for their migration to Australia. 
     
      
    7 The applicant was arrested on 4 July 2005. He was released on bail on 18 October 2005. He therefore spent 3 months and 14 days in custody. This was entirely referable to the present offences. 
     
      
    8 It was therefore put to his Honour that the sentences should be backdated to take account of the whole of that period. 
     
      
    9 The sole ground of the application is that the sentencing judge erred in failing to give proper allowance for the applicant’s pre-sentence custody. 
     
      
    10 In fact, it appears that his Honour accepted the submission in principle. However, what he said was that the applicant had been in custody “for some 3 months or thereabouts before bail was granted”. He therefore backdated the earliest of the sentences to commence on 10 May 2007. It is now put that the applicant was entitled to an additional 14 days’ credit to take account of the entire period of pre-sentence custody. 
     
      
    11 The Crown did not accept that the applicant is entitled to any further backdating of the sentences. On behalf of the Crown it was argued that the sentences imposed are, in any event, unduly lenient, and reflected error in the application of the principles stated in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610. 
     
      
    12 It also argued that the applicant had not shown that lesser sentences are warranted in law and should have been imposed: see s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912; R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704. 
     
      
    13 On the other hand, the applicant cited the decision of this Court in McCabe v R [2006] NSWCCA 220; 164 A Crim R 344. That decision, while not laying down any binding principle, did accept, for that case, the proposition that the applicant was entitled to credit for the whole of the period of pre-sentence custody. 
     
      
    14 I can see no reason not to follow the course taken in that case. 
     
      
    15 I propose that the application be granted, and the appeal allowed, to the extent that the commencement date of the sentences imposed in respect of counts 1 to 4 be adjusted by commencing on 26 April 2007. 
     
      
    16 I therefore propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) leave to appeal granted; 
       
       
      (2) appeal allowed, sentences quashed and in lieu thereof the following sentences be imposed: 
       
       
        
        count 1:  
        imprisonment for a fixed term of 1 year and 9 months, commencing on 26 April 2007 and expiring on 25 January 2009; 
        
       
       
        
        counts 2, 3 & 4:  
        imprisonment made up of a non-parole period of 1 year and 4 months, commencing 26 July 2007 and expiring on 25 November 2008 with a balance of term of 1 year and 2 months expiring on 25 January 2010; 
        
       
       
        
        count 5:  
        imprisonment made up of a non-parole period of 1 year and 4 months, commencing on 26 September 2007 and expiring on 25 January 2009 with a balance of term of 1 year and 2 months expiring 25 March 2010. 
        
       
      
    17 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Simpson J. 
     
      
    18 McCALLUM J: I agree with Simpson J.

     Judgment 
    1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Solomon DCJ in Sydney District Court. The applicant had been committed for sentence from the Local Court on a charge of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon, an offence which carries a prescribed maximum penalty of imprisonment for twenty years. The applicant adhered to his plea and asked his Honour to take into account five other offences, being three charges of obtaining a valuable thing by deception, one charge of driving a conveyance without the consent of the owner and one charge of driving a stolen motor vehicle. 
     
      
    2 His Honour imposed a sentence consisting of imprisonment for a non-parole period of three years and six months commencing on 24 January 2007, together with a balance term also of three years and six months commencing on 24 July 2010. 
     
      
    3 The applicant has appeared for himself in this application and I shall in due course turn to the matters which he has sought to raise. 
     
      
    4 The proceedings in the District Court included the tender of an agreed statement of facts which had been reduced to writing and signed by the applicant and the solicitor representing the prosecution. I extract there-from that about 1.30pm on Sunday 13 August 2006, Mr Aldo Capaldi was walking along a street in Newtown on his way to work. He was wearing a backpack. The applicant approached him in a motor vehicle which had been stolen. A woman named Amanda Barnes was in the passenger seat. The applicant alighted from the vehicle and accused Mr Capaldi of “messing” with his girlfriend. Mr Capaldi had never met either the applicant or Ms Barnes. The applicant produced a knife, asked for cash and threatened to stab Mr Capaldi.  
     
      
    5 In response, Mr Capaldi yielded possession of his backpack which contained a number of items including his driver’s licence, credit cards and some cash. The applicant left the scene and went to a shopping centre where he used Mr Capaldi’s credit card for the purpose of obtaining goods. In the meanwhile, Mr Capaldi had reported what had happened to police and as well contacted the issuers of his credit cards. Prompt reaction by them and by the police led to the arrest of the applicant and Ms Barnes at the shopping centre.  
     
      
    6 The three charges of obtaining goods by deception related to the use of the stolen credit cards, the respective purchases by the applicant being cigarettes for $155.50, jewellery for $1200 and a gaming console for $638 
     
      
    7 The first offence relating to a motor vehicle concerned that being driven by the applicant on the day of the robbery. The second offence concerning a vehicle related to a theft at Mosman on 22 February 2006. The vehicle was recovered by police on 9 July 2006 and the applicant’s DNA was identified on the steering wheel. 
     
      
    8 The evidence before Solomon DCJ was that Ms Barnes had pleaded guilty to concealing a serious indictable offence and she had been dealt with prior to the appearance of the applicant.  
     
      
    9 The applicant was born on 17 July 1973 and is therefore now aged 35 years. He has a significant record commencing with appearances in the Children’s Court from 1989. As an adult in 1992 he was sentenced to a minimum term of two years and six months with an additional term of two years and six months for a number of offences, including two counts of armed robbery. In 1995, he was sentenced in the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court to imprisonment for three years for an offence described as robbery using force on a person. At Parramatta District Court in 1998, he was sentenced to a minimum term of three years with an additional term of three years for robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon. 
     
      
    10 I do not list all of the other convictions which the applicant has, but in May 2004 he received sentences at Parramatta District Court for taking and driving a conveyance and a number of driving offences. He was on parole at the time of committing the current offence.  
     
      
    11 After his arrest on 13 August 2006, he was ordered to serve the balance of the 2004 sentences consequent upon his parole being revoked and that balance was due to expire on 31 March 2007. I should also note that on 25 January 2008, the applicant was sentenced at Central Local Court to a term of six months imprisonment commencing on 25 January 2008 for being carried in a stolen conveyance. That sentence would be served entirely within the non-parole period imposed by Solomon DCJ.  
     
      
    12 Grounds of appeal have been filed and the applicant stated: 
     
      
       
        
        1. I would like to appeal please on the judge error by not seeing the good things that I was doing and to take it into account. 
        
       
       2. That I am registered under the Mental Health Act. 
       
       3. That I was misrepresented by my solicitor, Mr Galloways. 
       
       4. I never got my full backdate spending time in custody. 
       
        
        5. I pleaded guilty then my charge got changed into another charge. 
        
       
      
    13 In support of these grounds, the applicant has filed a written submission in which he states that he had no intention to do this “unlawful crime”, that he was coerced by his co-offender and that he has a mentality of a 15-year-old kid and does not think “straight away.” The applicant also states that he was working when he was arrested, going to TAFE and trying to assist himself. He gave evidence at the sentencing proceedings and stated that it was at Ms Barnes’ instigation that he committed the offence, that he had been attending TAFE and he had been working as an electrician’s assistant.  
     
      
    14 In his remarks on sentence, his Honour made no express reference to these matters but it is clear in his observations concerning the progress towards rehabilitation that he had those matters in mind. Although the applicant observed that he has lived on the streets from a very young age, his Honour noted that he now had the support of his family and that his parents had indicated a willingness for him to reside with them after his release. 
     
      
    15 There was no evidence that the applicant was “registered under the Mental Health Act” and a psychiatric report expressed the opinion that the applicant did not present with either history or symptoms consistent with major mental illness. 
     
      
    16 His Honour had a discretion to exercise in relation to setting the commencement date of sentence. From the day after the applicant’s arrest until 31 March 2007, the applicant would be held in custody in any event pursuant to the revocation of his parole order. His Honour ordered a commencement date of 24 January 2007, thus according the applicant a benefit of concurrency of a little over two months. The applicant had no entitlement for the sentence to be backdated to the date of his arrest. 
     
      
    17 I have already observed that during the currency of this sentence he has been required to serve no additional time in respect of the conviction in January this year. It is obvious from the specification of the non-parole period as a proportion of total sentence that his Honour accorded to the applicant a considerable opportunity to pursue efforts at rehabilitation.  
     
      
    18 There is no error demonstrated in his Honour’s approach to sentence, nor in his assessment. Given the circumstances of the offence and the applicant’s prior record, the imposition manifests some significant leniency being accorded to the applicant. 
     
      
    19 In oral submissions today the applicant referred to a continuing desire to have some assistance, particularly with rehabilitation by the entry into a drug program. This is of course a court of error and whilst it is to be hoped that the applicant can pursue his hopes for rehabilitation, that is not a basis upon which the intervention of this court can be attracted. He has also expressed sorrow for what he has done and for my part I would be prepared to accept the sincerity of what he has said, but again that is not a basis upon which this appellate court can intervene and re-sentence. 
     
      
    20 I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    21 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Grove J. 
     
      
    22 HOWIE J: I also agree. 
     
      
    23 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: Accordingly, the orders of the court are as proposed by Grove J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: On 3 March 2008 the applicant was indicted with his brother Dror Salah on a charge of murder. They were charged that each did jointly murder the deceased, Hernan Guelman on 5 August 2006 at Bondi Beach. On 10 March 2008 Dror Salah pleaded guilty to manslaughter and the applicant pleaded guilty to accessory after the fact to manslaughter. The Crown accepted each plea in satisfaction of the indictment. The basis of the plea by Dror Salah was of excessive self-defence. The penalty for the offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty is imprisonment for five years. 
     
      
    2 It is apparent from these circumstances that the applicant was sentenced after some days of the trial. However, we are informed that the expectation was that the trial still had approximately 5 weeks to run. The Crown proposed to call many further witnesses in establishing the Crown case. 
     
      
    3 The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for three years with a non-parole period of one year and eleven months with both periods to date from 8 August 2006. His Honour directed the release of the applicant on completion of his non-parole period on 7 July 2008. That date, of course, is a little more than a month from today. In these circumstances, the court believes it is appropriate to make its decision today and provide the necessary reasons. 
     
      
    4 The applicant supported his appeal by defining 12 grounds of appeal. However, on the hearing of the matter counsel confined the appeal to three matters. These were that the discount, which was 10 per cent, provided by his Honour for the plea of guilty was excessively low and amendable to correction by this Court. It was further submitted that his Honour was in error in giving significance to the fact that the applicant was present when the deceased was killed. Finally, it is submitted that the sentence in all the circumstances was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    5 The question of the appropriate discount in the circumstances of this case is attended with complexity. Although it was undoubtedly the case that the applicant could have offered to plead to the offence for which he was subsequently convicted at any time after he had been charged with the offence of murder, it could be thought that to impose this obligation would be somewhat artificial when the applicant was not aware of the fate of any charge in relation to the primary offender. The penalty for the offence of accessory after the fact to manslaughter carried a maximum sentence of five years compared with a far greater penalty in relation to the offence of accessory after the fact to murder. Consideration of the appropriate discount for a plea in these circumstances may require careful consideration by this Court on some occasion. 
     
      
    6 The applicant in pursuing this application has not asked the court to review the head sentence but presses only for the court to now confine the non-parole period to a period which would expire today. Given the limited nature of the application, the complexities of the relevant or appropriate discount, in my opinion, need not be further considered. I am of the same view in relation to the question of the presence of the applicant at the scene when the deceased was killed. 
     
      
    7 In my opinion, it is only necessary to consider the circumstances relating to the practical assistance provided by the applicant as against the circumstances in which the offence was committed to reach the conclusion that in this case the sentence was excessive. It is also unnecessary, having regard to the limited argument on appeal to consider further the extent to which the sentence may have been excessive beyond expressing a view in relation to the non-parole period. 
     
      
    8 The court has been assisted by access to the limited statistics available from the Judicial Commission both in relation to the offence of accessory after the fact to manslaughter and also accessory after the fact to murder. Those statistics are limited by reason of the number of offenders for which sentences have been collected, but indicate, in my view, that at least the non-parole period which his Honour imposed in the present circumstances was excessive. 
     
      
    9 As I have indicated, it is unnecessary for the court to describe the non-parole period which would have been appropriate beyond expressing the view that a period which expires today would not be lenient in all the circumstances. In coming to this view I am mindful of the fact that the applicant provided relatively confined assistance to the principal offender over a short period of time. There was also a family relationship between them which was relevant to the sentence which should be imposed. 
     
      
    10 Having regard to these matters, I am of the view that this Court should intervene to the extent of quashing the non-parole period provided by his Honour and imposing a non-parole period of one year, nine months and twenty-five days, that period expiring today. 
     
      
    11 It would follow that this Court would make an order directing the release of the applicant at the completion of his non-parole period which would expire at midnight today. 
     
      
    12 HULME J: I agree.13 HIDDEN J: I also agree.14 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The order of the court will be as I have indicated.

     Judgment 
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The court is in a position to deliver judgment. I will ask Nettle AJA to deliver the first judgment. 
     
      
    2 NETTLE AJA: On 15 August 2006, the applicant pleaded guilty to one count of aiding, abetting, counselling and procuring the importation of a commercial quantity of a prohibited import (namely, 34.8065 kilograms of methylamphetamine) contrary to s 11.2(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (C’th) and s 233B(1)(a)(ii) of the Customs Act 1901 (C’th) and on 5 May 2006 he pleaded guilty to one count of supplying an indictable quantity of a prohibited drug (namely, 3.64 grams of MDMA) contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). In each case the plea was entered at the first available opportunity. 
     
      
    3 After hearing a plea in mitigation of penalty, on 5 October 2007, Judge Freeman sentenced the applicant:  
     
      
       
      (a) On the Commonwealth offence to 16½ years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of 10 years to commence on 15 February 2007, with the applicant thus to be eligible for parole on 14 February 2017; and  
       
      (b) On the State offence to two years and three months’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of 20 months to date from 15 February 2006 (being the date on which the applicant was arrested). 
       
       
      The Facts 
       
      
    4 The facts of the State offence, as they appear in the judge's sentencing remarks, were as follows. On 3 September 2005, the applicant was standing outside the Homebush State Sports Centre in an admissions line awaiting admission when he attracted the attention of a drug detection dog. He was asked by the officer attending the dog whether he had any prohibited substances and he replied, ‘Yeah, I've got three or four’. He was then handed over to police and repeated that answer to their questions. He was thus taken to a designated search area where he reached into his underwear and removed a number of small violet coloured tablets and a piece of rolled up tissue. There were twelve violet coloured tablets which upon analysis were found to contain MDMA. Other tablets in the rolled up tissue also contained MDMA and another couple of them contained methylamphetamine. The total weight of the MDMA was 3.64 grams. The applicant also had in his possession the sum of $780 which was not explicable by reference to his known financial circumstances – he being unemployed – and his explanation that he had received the money for work at the fish market was rejected as demonstrably false. After being charged, he was released on bail.  
     
      
    5 The Commonwealth offence was committed while he was released on bail. The applicant was acquainted with a person known as ‘Uncle’ who had lived adjacent to him in Vietnam where he was born. Following his release on bail the applicant travelled to Vietnam and met Uncle. Uncle proposed that the applicant assist him in obtaining delivery of a boat, which according to Uncle had already arrived in Australia, although in fact it did not arrive until 12 October 2005. The applicant understood that the boat was a means of bringing a prohibited substance into Australia. There was a series of plastic bags secreted in its hull which contained a total of 34.8 kilograms of pure methylamphetamine with a gross weight of 46 kilograms, of which the minimum wholesale value was $5 million.  
     
      
    6 Uncle gave the applicant the documents necessary to clear the boat through Customs. Fearing, however, that his English was not up to the task, the applicant engaged the assistance of a co-offender who thereafter took an active role in dealing with Customs agents for the Customs clearance of the boat and recruiting other persons to take physical possession of the boat. There was a deal of communication between the applicant and To and Uncle in Vietnam, and ultimately the consignee of the boat, who it was said was a person with a Vietnamese name in a Catholic Girls College in the Australian Capital Territory, signed over such interest as they may have had in the boat to To who thus became entitled to take delivery. Sums of money totalling more than $60,000, of which more than $45,000 was identified as coming from Uncle, were then paid into the account of the Customs agents. The applicant was active in checking on To's progress and making decisions as to how the boat was ultimately to be delivered in a shipping container and in recruiting persons whose homes were to be used to house the container after its arrival.  
     
      
    7 In the result, the judge characterised the applicant as a principal in Australia in recruiting To, supervising To, making other arrangements and being a very high level player in the importation. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 – Two stage sentencing process 
       
      
    8 In the course of his sentencing remarks, the judge observed in relation to the Commonwealth offence:  
     
      
       
        
        “Now, there is a certain tension, at least in my mind, between the concept of intuitive sentencing and the requirement that some mathematical calculations be revealed as to how this intuition has been played out. For that reason, I indicate that I would have started with a sentence of twenty-seven and a half years. I apply a 40 per cent discount, that being the combination of the discount applicable in respect of his plea and his assistance.” 
        
       
      
    9 Under cover of ground 1, the applicant contends that the judge thereby erred in law by taking a mathematical or two stage approach to the sentencing process rather than the intuitive synthesis approach mandated by the High Court in Markarian v R (2005) 228 CLR 357. In particular, counsel submitted that the judge was bound in relation to the Commonwealth offence to have regard to such of the factors set out in s 16 A of the Crimes Act 1914 (C’th) as were relevant to the applicant, and to weigh them all together, whereas what the judge appeared to have done in fact was to separate out the discount for the plea of guilty and cooperation and deal with it discretely. In effect, in counsel's submission, the same was also true of the State offence: the decision in Markarian bound the judge to synthesise all of the relevant sentencing considerations together rather than separating out the discount for plea and cooperation and dealing with it individually. 
     
      
    10 In my view that submission is not persuasive. There is no question of the judge failing to take into account any of the relevant sentencing considerations. It is plain from his Honour's thorough and carefully constructed sentencing remarks that he had regard to all relevant considerations. The only thing which might be said to be a problem is that his Honour quantified the amount of the discount; and in the circumstances of this case, I do not consider that Markarian prevented him from adopting that course.  
     
      
    11 Markarian laid down as a matter of general principal that:  
     
      
       
        
        “So long as the sentencing judge must or may take account of all of the circumstances of the offence and the offender, to single out some of those considerations and attribute specific numerical or proportionate value to some features distorts the already difficult balancing exercise which the judge must perform.” 
        
       
      
    12 Such a statement of principle does not sit easily with the encouragement offered to sentencing judges in R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 to quantify the guilty plea discount. Hence, as Barr J put it in R v Mo (2007) 169 A Crim R 60 at 64, such encouragement should not be seen as amounting to a requirement.  
     
      
    13 But that said, as the High Court itself noted in Markarian, there are cases in which some indulgence in what they called the arithmetical process will better serve the ends of accessible reasoning; and I do not consider that the judge was wrong to approach this case on the basis that it was one of them. 
     
      
    14 Relatively speaking, the combined discount for the applicant's plea of guilty and assistance to the authorities was the single most important mitigative consideration in his Honour's sentencing process and therefore something in which the victims, the parties, this Court and the public would be likely to have considerable interest. Further, although the case as such might not be described as simple, the identification and quantification of the discount was in this case just that. And nothing which I have heard in the course of argument suggests that there was anything artificial in ascribing a value to it. (Compare R v Gallagher, (1991) 23 NSWLR 220 at 226 to 230). 
     
      
    15 Accordingly, I would reject ground 1. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 
       
      
    16 Under ground 2, counsel for the applicant argued that the judge erred in the formulation of the discount of 40 per cent by ascribing 25 per cent to the plea of guilty and thus only 15 per cent to the applicant's assistance and undertaking to give evidence. Especially was that so, it was submitted, given that the judge found that the applicant's assistance to the police was ‘very significant’.  
     
      
    17 What his Honour said about the level of discount, and whether he ascribed a figure of 25 per cent to the plea of guilty for the purposes of the Commonwealth offence, is debatable. But assuming that his Honour did do what is alleged, in my view there was no error. For accepting that his Honour attributed 25 per cent to the discount for the plea of guilty and 15 per cent to the cooperation with the authorities, to my way of thinking the discount of 40 per cent allowed in this case belies the notion that he did not give full credit for the ‘very significant’ value of the assistance given to the police in relation to the Commonwealth offence. Granted that there is no fixed tariff for assistance to the authorities – it reflects a number of considerations that impact upon the sentence to be imposed – current sentencing practices suggests a range of somewhere between 20 per cent and 50 per cent for the combined discount for plea of guilty and assistance to the police and that a discount of more than 40 per cent should only very exceptionally be granted, and ordinarily only then where there is evidence that the offender will serve his or her sentence, or a substantial part of it, in more onerous conditions than the general prison population. In this case there is no evidence of that kind and, on that basis, a discount of 40 per cent was, in my view, about as much as the applicant could have hoped to achieve.  
     
      
    18 To that may be added that where, as in this case, the judge does give a specific discount, the question on appeal is not so much one of numeric value ascribed to the discount, as whether, after all the relevant matters have been taken into account, the sentence is appropriate. For the reasons which follow I consider that it is. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 – Manifest excessiveness, State offence 
       
      
    19 Under the heading of ‘Manifest Excessiveness’, counsel for the applicant argued that the sentence of two years and three months’ imprisonment imposed on the State count of supplying an indictable quantity of MDMA was beyond the range, given that the quantity was only 3.64 grams in the form of only 18 ecstasy tablets and that the applicant had no prior criminal history concerning illicit drugs. In counsel's submission, if the applicant had stood for sentence on that offence alone he would have been unlikely to receive a full-time custodial sentence, let alone a full-time sentence of two years and three months. It was more likely, it was said, that he would have received a wholly or partially suspended sentence or a sentence to be served by way of periodic detention. Additionally, it was contended, the judge had not taken into consideration s 23 of the Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act 1999 (NSW) which warranted a lesser penalty having regard to the high degree to which the applicant had assisted the law enforcement authorities and undertook to assist them in the future.  
     
      
    20 I accept those submissions up to a point. Given the relatively modest quantity of the drug involved and the applicant's antecedents, the sentence may appear to be stern. As the judge disclosed in his sentencing remarks, the starting point was a sentence of three years, from which he then deducted the 25 per cent discount allowed for the applicant's plea of guilty. Other things being equal, a sentence of three years for the kind of offence in question could be viewed as being towards the upper end of the range. But that said, I am certainly not persuaded that the sentence of two years and three months was beyond the range. For despite the relatively small quantity of the drug involved, it was enough in combination with the cash found on the applicant to put the offence into a category which Parliament regards as so serious as to warrant a maximum penalty of 25 years’ imprisonment. And contrary to the tenor of the submissions put on behalf of the applicant, the offence could not be regarded as isolated in light of the subsequent Commonwealth offence. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4 – Manifest excessiveness, Commonwealth offence 
       
      
    21 Finally, counsel for the applicant argued that the starting point of 27½ years adopted in relation to the sentence of 16½ years imposed in relation to the Commonwealth offence was manifestly excessive and informed by an error on the part of the judge in attributing too much weight to the sentence of 25 years’ imprisonment imposed on the applicant's co-offender, To. It was submitted that, given the applicant's level of objective criminality, early plea of guilty and the high value of his assistance to law enforcement authorities, compared to the level of To's objective criminality, his defence of the charge and his lack of assistance to authorities, the applicant's sentence should have been very much less than To's. 
     
      
    22 That submission should be rejected. As it appears from the judge's sentencing remarks, the sentence imposed on To was rightly regarded by both defence counsel and the Crown as the single most important indication of the sentence to be imposed. As the judge put it:  
     
      
       
        
        “I do not regard the fixing of the twenty-five years as being an ironclad direction to this court but I do regard it as the single most important indicator, since it is common ground between counsel for the prisoner and the Crown that it would be difficult to distinguish in any meaningful way between the criminal culpability demonstrated by To, on the one hand, and by this prisoner, on the other. Their roles may have been somewhat different. It might be thought that this prisoner Bui was somewhat higher up the chain but, on the other hand, To was the more completely involved in facilitating the handling of the importation, and so on in any event. Parity is a powerful argument in favour of me approaching the sentence of this prisoner conformably with the sentence imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in relation to To.” 
        
       
      
    23 But as the judge went on to observe, the fact that the applicant had offended while an bail aggravated the offence significantly and led as his Honour put it to a starting point somewhat higher than the sentence imposed on To:  
     
      
       
        
        “Certainly this was not the most aggravating factor one could imagine but it is nonetheless, in my view, a significant aggravating factor because it involves the supply of drugs, on the one hand, and the attempted importation obviously for the ultimate purpose of supply of drugs, on the other.” 
        
       
      
    24 With respect, I consider that his Honour's approach was correct. This was a serious example of a particularly serious offence in which the applicant was properly characterised by the judge as playing a principal role more or less comparable in terms of objective criminality of that played by To. The gravity of the offending was then aggravated by the fact that it was committed while on bail, and it is recognised that offences committed while on bail require severely deterrent sentences. (See R v Pham (1991) 55 A Crim R 128 at 134.) Thus, as the judge rightly observed, this offence deserved condign punishment.  
     
      
    25 Given all that, and the substantial discount of 40 percent allowed for the applicant's plea of guilty and cooperation with the authorities, I am unable to perceive any lack of parity with respect to To or any other sentencing considerations sufficient to put the sentence beyond the acceptable range. 
     
      
    26 In the result I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him in the District Court on 18 August 2006 following his conviction after trial on three counts of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of ten years. The child in question was the applicant’s own daughter aged eight (Count 1) and nine (Counts 3 and 4). On the findings of the sentencing judge the offences were, respectively, committed in February 2004, August 2004 and September 2004. The victim turned nine between February and August. 
     
      
    2 The offences for which the applicant stood to be sentenced were offences committed in contravention of s 66A of the Crimes Act 1900, which provides for a statutory maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years. In addition, pursuant to the provisions of Div 1A of Pt 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Act”), offences in contravention of s 66A of the Crimes Act attract a standard non-parole period of imprisonment for 15 years. 
     
      
    3 The sentencing judge found that both Counts 1 and 4, which involved penile penetration, were offences which fell within the middle range of objective seriousness. His Honour determined, however, that there were reasons for setting a non-parole period shorter than the standard non-parole period of 15 years. His Honour found that Count 3 (digital penetration) whilst serious, was not an offence falling within the middle range of objective seriousness. 
     
      
    4 With respect to Count 1 his Honour set a non-parole period of 13 years with a balance of term of 4 years and 4 months. The non-parole period was ordered to commence on 18 August 2006. With respect to Count 4 his Honour set a non-parole period of 13 years with a balance of term of 5 years. The non-parole period was ordered to commence on 18 August 2009. With respect to Count 3 his Honour set a non-parole period of 7 years with a balance of term of 2 years and 4 months. The non-parole period was ordered to commence on 18 August 2013. The overall effective non-parole period is 16 years with a balance of term of 5 years. 
     
      
    5 There is no dispute with respect to the findings of fact by the sentencing judge. Paragraphs [9]-[22] should be taken to be set out herein. I will refer to the facts relevant to a particular ground of appeal when I deal with it. 
     
      
    6 The first ground of appeal is: 
     
      
       
        
        “The sentencing judge erred in finding that the offences committed by the applicant were aggravated on the basis that the victim was vulnerable because she was very young.” 
        
       
      
    7 His Honour made a finding that two of the three offences were in the middle range of seriousness and, said that, in accordance with s 54B of the Act, he could only impose a sentence that varied from the prescribed standard non-parole period for the reasons set out in s 21A of the Act. One of the matters identified as an aggravating factor by s 21A(2)(l) is:  
     
      
       
        
        “The victim was vulnerable, for example, because the victim was very young or very old or had a disability, or because of the victim’s occupation (such as taxi driver, bus driver or other public transport worker, bank teller or service station attendant)”. 
        
       
      
    8 In his remarks on sentence Finnane DCJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        ‘”[26] Of the matters mentioned in section 21A, I am of the opinion that there are some aggravating factors, namely that the offender abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim, and that the victim was vulnerable because she was very young.” 
        
       
      
    9 Counsel for the applicant emphasised that the offences found to have been committed were against s 66A of the Crimes Act, which applied to acts of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of ten years. As noted above, the maximum penalty for such an offence is 25 years by comparison to s 66C, where the maximum sentence for an equivalent offence against a child aged between ten and fourteen years is 16 years. 
     
      
    10 Section 21A(2) of the Act provides expressly: 
     
      
       
        
        “The court is not to have additional regard to any such aggravating factor in sentencing if it is an element of the offence.” 
        
       
      
    11 This section is reinforced by s 21A(4) which provides that the court is not to have regard to an aggravating factor if it would be contrary to any Act or rule of law to do so.  
     
      
    12 It is well established that with respect to a matter such as age, which is an element of the relevant offence, that a sentencing court must avoid the possibility of double counting when determining the existence of, and degree of, an aggravating factor. (See eg R v Tadrosse [2005] NSWCCA 145; (2005) 65 NSWLR 740; JAH v R [2006] NSWCCA 250 at [25]-[26].) 
     
      
    13 As quoted above, s 21A(2)(l) refers to the fact that “the victim was very young”. His Honour adopted that very terminology in [26] of his remarks on sentence. There is work for this part of s 21A(2)(l) to do even in the context of an offence which contains the age of the victim as part of the offence. The younger the victim the more serious the offence.  
     
      
    14 As Howie J said in Shannon v R [2006] NSWCCA 39: 
     
      
       
        
        “[28] … The age of the child is clearly a relevant consideration and the younger the child, the more serious the offence. It was an element of each of the offences in the present case that the child was between the ages of 10 and 16 at the time of the sexual intercourse, but that does not mean that a judge cannot take into account the age of the child falling within that range. 
        
       
       
        
        [29] Further, although the section is, as the judge recognised, concerned to protect the vulnerable, it does not follow that a judge cannot take into account the particular vulnerability of the child by reason of the child’s young age or other circumstances other than the child’s age …” 
        
       
      
    15 In written submissions counsel for the applicant referred to the trial judge’s finding of vulnerability and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “He did not explain this finding. Bearing in mind that the offence only occurs if the victim is 9 years or younger at the time, and the fact that the victim was 9 years old in respect of counts 3 and 5, and 8 years old in respect of count 1, it is difficult to discern the basis on which the sentencing judge made this finding.” 
        
       
      
    16 The issue is whether the trial judge ought not have found that the victim in the present case could be categorised as “very young” for the purposes of an offence that required the victim to be under the age of ten years. 
     
      
    17 The Crown responded to the submission by invoking a passage in the course of the sentencing hearing which occurred on 9 June 2006, over two months before the sentence was handed down on 18 August 2006. As the Crown submitted, this passage indicated quite clearly that his Honour recognised the dangers of double counting in this very respect: 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: He had a relationship with her on the evidence that continued over a period and he has been convicted of three offences occurring at different periods during the course of this relationship if one could call it that. I have to take into account her age, her relationship to him. 
        
       
       
        
        JAUNCEY: The relationship to him is an aggravating feature of 21A because he’s obviously a person in authority, the question of age is not an aggravating feature. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: No it’s not an aggravating factor because I take into account her age, the charge requires me to because she’s under the age of ten but it doesn’t aggravate, you don’t get an extra aggravation because the offence itself. 
        
       
       
        
        JAUNCEY: No, but it is something that your Honour quite right takes into account, the question as to whether this specific offence is more serious for example the younger the child.” 
        
       
      
    18 As this passage makes clear, Mr Jauncey, who appeared for the applicant at the sentence hearing, acknowledged that his Honour was entitled to take into account age on the basis that the younger the child the greater the degree of vulnerability, even for an offence which requires the victim to be under a specified age. Nevertheless, the clarity of his Honour’s statement that there was no additional aggravation by reason of being under the age of ten suggests that it is unlikely that his Honour would determine the sentence contrary to this basis. 
     
      
    19 This is a case in which it is appropriate to have regard to his Honour’s remarks during submissions in order to assess his remarks on sentence, even though the latter were not delivered ex tempore. (See Daniels v R [2007] NSWCCA 372 at [13]-[14]; Hughes v R [2008] NSWCCA 48 at [33]-[35].) 
     
      
    20 There is some difficulty, as counsel for the applicant submitted, in determining the precise basis on which his Honour made the finding expressed at [26] of his remarks on sentence. There is less difficulty with respect to the offence committed at the age of eight. However, his Honour did not distinguish between the two periods of offending. 
     
      
    21 It is the express reference to vulnerability because of age with respect to the two later offences that leads me to conclude that his Honour did overlook the matter at the time of sentence, being a matter about which he had earlier indicated a clear understanding. It may have been open to make some adjustment for the additional vulnerability of an eight year old. I do not see how that can be said for a nine year old. 
     
      
    22 This ground of appeal has been made out. 
     
      
    23 The second ground of appeal is: 
     
      
       
        
        “The sentencing judge erred in determining that counts 1 and 4 were in the middle of the range of seriousness.” 
        
       
      
    24 Counts 1 and 4 involved acts of penile penetration whereas the other count, which his Honour held was below the mid-range of seriousness, involved digital penetration. 
     
      
    25 The applicant submits that the judgment formulated by the sentencing judge in this regard miscarried, in part on the basis that he had assessed the vulnerability of the victim in an impermissible way, being the subject of the first ground of appeal. 
     
      
    26 The way his Honour approached the matter was to first express the conclusion that these two offences were in the middle range of seriousness and then to turn to s 21A. He did so expressly by reason of the requirement under s 54B(3), that he was not entitled to depart from the prescribed standard non-parole period save on the basis of, inter alia, s 21A(2)(l).  
     
      
    27 His Honour, nevertheless, did appear to take into account the aggravating factor here identified when he went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “[29] I have come to the conclusion that the two offences of penile penetration,  
        having regard to the aggravating factors 
         and the context of their having been committed against the victim, along with 20 or 30 other similar offences, means that each of them is at least, a middle range offence. Whilst I consider, for reasons which I have already given that the first such offence was worse than the other, I am unable to conclude that this means that the offence is greater than a middle range offence. These offences are middle range offences, because they are committed by a father, against his daughter. The wilful invasion for sexual purposes of the body of a child, who is less than 10 years old, is one of the most appalling crimes that could be committed. In my opinion it is much worse when it is committed by a father.” [Emphasis added] 
        
       
      
    28 The first sentence of this paragraph expressly refers to his having had regard to the aggravating factors. Although, there is no reference of that character in the last three sentences of this passage. Nevertheless, his Honour’s express statement in the first sentence does suggest that the above finding on Ground 1 does affect Ground 2. 
     
      
    29 The applicant also submits that with respect to Counts 1 and 4 there was no penetration of the hymen or vagina of the victim. The penetration was of the genitalia, by the applicant rubbing his penis against her labia. Counsel for the applicant submitted that his Honour’s failure to make reference to this distinction was of significance particularly in a context where there were no threats or coercion involved.  
     
      
    30 A judgment of this character involves the exercise of a broad discretion with which this Court is reluctant to interfere. The nature and extent of penile penetration is a relevant consideration in determining the objective seriousness of the offence. However, I am not satisfied that his Honour failed to take the matter into account. His Honour was clearly aware of the evidence which identified the precise nature of the act of penetration. In describing Count 1 he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[11] … He then placed his penis between her legs from the back into her vulval opening.” 
        
       
      
    31 Although there was no express reference of this character with respect to Count 4 his Honour was clearly attentive to the nature of the penetration. It was open to his Honour to regard penetration of the character identified in the evidence as being in the mid-range of seriousness. 
     
      
    32 With respect to the issue of vulnerability by reason of age, Kirby J said in MLP v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 271; (2006) 164 A Crim R 93: 
     
      
       
        
        “[22] Unquestionably, the age of the victim is an important consideration in determining the objective seriousness of the crime and whether it falls within the mid range. But it does not follow that, because age is relevant and because the section contemplates a range of ages, an offence against a child approaching the age of 10 cannot be regarded, or should not be regarded, as being within the mid range. The section is concerned with the protection of the vulnerable from sexual exploitation and violation. No doubt, as a generalisation, the younger the child the more defenceless and vulnerable. However, the entire class of children under the age of 10 years is vulnerable. Whilst the age of the victim was a matter for his Honour to consider (which he obviously did) his remarks do not betray error.” 
        
       
      
    33 This analysis is equally applicable to the issue of extent of penetration. A limited degree of penetration is not necessarily indicative of a lower level of objective seriousness. 
     
      
    34 Accordingly, in my opinion, this ground is made out only on the basis upon which I would uphold Ground 1, by reason of the fact that his Honour, perhaps unnecessarily, expressly linked the two. 
     
      
    35 Ground 3 in the appeal is: 
     
      
       
        
        “The sentencing judge erred in failing to sentence the applicant on the basis that he was unlikely to re-offend.” 
        
       
      
    36 This matter is expressly identified as a possible mitigating factor in s 21A(3)(g) of the Act. Counsel for the applicant submitted that in view of his Honour’s finding that it was unlikely that he could re-offend against his daughter and that there was no evidence to suggest that the applicant had a general interest in abusing young girls, his Honour ought to have found that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend. 
     
      
    37 There were references of this character in his Honour’s reasons particularly in the context of assessing an expert report on the issue of rehabilitation by Dr Lennings a psychologist. His Honour dealt with this matter in some detail and the factual findings to which the applicant refers were made in the context of this overall assessment.  
     
      
    38 The following passages of his Honour’s remarks about this evidence are pertinent: 
     
      
       
        
        “[4] He maintains his innocence and thus I must regard him as showing no contrition and no remorse. Notwithstanding the report of Dr Lennings, I am unable to form any view that he is likely to rehabilitate himself. This is because he continues to maintain his innocence, he has given no evidence before me at any time and I simply lack any evidentiary basis for coming to the conclusion that he is likely to rehabilitate himself. 
        
       
       
        
        [5] Dr Lennings has expressed the opinion that there was a low likelihood of a risk of re-offending. His opinion is based on his application of a test known as ‘STATIC 99’. 
        
       
       
        
        [6] I have no confidence in the accuracy of this test, and I am unable to accept that Dr Lennings’ expertise as a psychologist enables him properly to express an expert opinion about re-offending. In my opinion it is not possible to determine whether the offender is likely to offend again. Certainly it is unlikely that he would ever be able to offend against his daughter. She lives in another State and she will be an adult before he is released from gaol. There is no evidence to suggest that he has any general interest in abusing young girls or that he has ever previously done so. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        [23] Dr Lennings is of the opinion that there is little risk of his offending again. As I have said before, I am not prepared to come to the same conclusion because he has given no evidence and the test, which Dr Lennings applied, obviously involved the assessment of a number of subjective factors. I do not have the same confidence in him as is expressed by Dr Lennings. In his report Dr Lennings asserts that ‘it is probably the case that Mr A’s situation is a product of a heightened opportunity to offend and in the main, such opportunity can be addressed by appropriate supervision strategies.’ I am unable to accept that this is a valid assessment of the situation at all. The offender chose the bed in which his children slept and he chose deliberately to sleep in that bed and to sexually abuse his daughter. A normally protective parent would not have engaged in conduct of this type.” 
        
       
      
    39 These findings were open to his Honour. The absence of evidence that the applicant had a general interest in abusing young girls is not of itself such as to require a finding that the offender is unlikely to reoffend. His Honour gave cogent reasons for refusing to draw the inference. The mitigating factor had not been established.  
     
      
    40 This ground should be rejected. 
     
      
    41 Ground 4 is: 
     
      
       
        
        “The sentencing judge erred in increasing the overall sentence in respect of count 4 in order to achieve an appropriate ratio between non-parole period and head sentence.” 
        
       
      
    42 This ground of appeal is based on the fact that his Honour found the first act of penile penetration (Count 1) was “worse than the other act of penile penetration” (Count 4). However, he actually imposed a head sentence for Count 4 of 18 years which was longer than the head sentence for Count 1 of 17 years and four months. Furthermore, the non-parole period was the same for each. 
     
      
    43 Counsel submitted that his Honour did not explain the distinction, but it appears that he reduced the ratio in respect of Count 1 from 75 percent to 72.2 percent in order to produce an overall effective ratio of about 75 percent. Mr S J Odgers SC submitted that it was reasonable to infer that the sentencing judge actually increased the term in respect of count 4 to overcome the impact of partial accumulation on the overall sentencing ratio. 
     
      
    44 Ms D M L Woodburne, who appeared for the Crown, submitted that what his Honour had said with respect to the seriousness of Count 1 was that the act of penile penetration was more serious by reason of the fact that ejaculation occurred on the first but not on the subsequent occasion. The Crown submitted that it could be that his Honour considered that Count 1 was the first in time whereas Count 4 occurred after a long period of abuse and, accordingly, “could not be regarded as spontaneous and opportunistic”. 
     
      
    45 The sentences imposed by his Honour on the respective counts were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1 – 13 years non-parole period commencing on 18 August 2006 until 17 August 2019 and a balance of term of 4.4 years ending on 17 December 2023. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 3 – 7 years non-parole period commencing on 18 August 2013 concluding on 17 August 2020 with a balance of term of 2.4 years concluding on 17 December 2022. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 4 – 13 years non-parole period commencing on 18 August 2009 and concluding on 17 August 2022 and a balance of term of 5 years concluding on 17 August 2027. 
        
       
      
    46 The critical question is the interrelationship between the sentences imposed on Count 1 and Count 4. The sentence for Count 3 overlaps with each, and to a certain degree both, of the other offences and the balance of term for Count 3 overlaps for all but 4 months with the non-parole period for Count 4 and otherwise overlaps with the balance of term for Counts 1 and 4. 
     
      
    47 The non-parole period for Count 1 is effectively for a period of 3 years, before overlapping with the non-parole period for Count 4. The non-parole period for Count 4 continues after the end of the non-parole period for Count 1 for a period of 3 years of which one year overlaps with the non-parole period for Count 3. The head sentence for Count 4 continues for 3 years and 8 months beyond the expiry of the head sentence for Count 1 of which 4 months overlaps with the parole period for Count 3. 
     
      
    48 The Crown’s submission is speculative. To a similar extent so is that of the applicant. Nevertheless, in view of the clear, and justifiable, finding of fact as to the greater objective seriousness of Ground 1, it appears that something has gone wrong. The applicant’s submission is, perhaps, the more likely explanation. This reflects the difficulty which sentencing judges now frequently encounter when seeking to comply with the technicalities of sentencing legislation which attempts to micro regulate a broad discretion in the context of the sentencing principle identified in R v Pearce [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610. 
     
      
    49 This ground of appeal has also been made out. 
     
      
    50 In my opinion, the element that his Honour referred to as an aggravating factor identified in terms of vulnerability because of age was, in accordance with his Honour’s analysis, of comparatively little significance in the determination of the overall sentence.  
     
      
    51 Nevertheless, by reason of the grounds of appeal that have been upheld it falls to this Court to redetermine the sentence. 
     
      
    52 I would reach the same conclusion as his Honour reached with respect to identifying each of Counts 1 and 4 as being in the middle level of seriousness. The abuse of position of trust by a father, in the overall circumstances of each offence, is entitled to significant weight. The helplessness of a young girl in such a family situation is apparent. The circumstances of the two offences are such that each of the two offences should be found to fall within the middle level of seriousness for purposes of applying the standard non-parole period. In this regard I agree with the substantial emphasis his Honour gave to the fact that these were offences committed by a father against a daughter, in a context where the appellant could not fall to be sentenced on the basis of committing an isolated offence. (See R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434; (2004) 150 A Crim A 575 esp at [20] and [25] and JAH v R supra at [31].) 
     
      
    53 His Honour identified reasons for imposing a non-parole period less than the 15 year standard non-parole period because, as he put it at [31]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender has never previously committed any serious offence, and…he was in many respects a good father and a good citizen”. 
        
       
       
      I accept this analysis. 
       
      
    54 I would also add that in my view there is a low probability of re-offending in this regard. Although, as I have indicated above, I do not find that his Honour erred in refusing to draw that conclusion, in my own view significant weight should be given to the fact that it is simply not conceivable, as Mr Odgers submitted, that the applicant will ever be able to sexually assault his daughter again. It was the element of the father/daughter relationship that was of particular significance in determining the objective seriousness of the offence. The absence of that element is also entitled to be taken into account when determining to impose a non-parole period less than the standard. 
     
      
    55 His Honour expressly took into account s 21A(3)(e) and (f) which identify as mitigating factors the absence of a record and being a person of good character. However, in my opinion, this Court should also take into account s 21A(3)(g) namely that the offender is unlikely to re-offend. I say that with respect particularly to the inconceivability of any ability to offend against his daughter. 
     
      
    56 I am also of the opinion that his Honour erred in imposing the same non-parole period for each of Counts 1 and 4 and a longer balance of term for Count 4. His Honour’s finding that Count 1 was a more serious offence was correct.  
     
      
    57 This Court should vary the non-parole period for Count 1 by reducing it to 12 years and the non-parole period for Count 4 by reducing it to 10 years, in each case reducing it from the standard non-parole period. In order to retain the balance between the respective counts I would also reduce the non-parole period for Count 3 to 6 years.  
     
      
    58 The orders I propose are as follows: 
     
      
       
      1 The sentences are quashed. 
       
       
      2 The following sentences are imposed: 
       
       
        
        Count 1 – Imprisonment for a non-parole period of 12 years to commence on 18 August 2006 and expire on 17 August 2018 with a balance of term of 4 years to commence on 18 August 2018 and to expire on 17 August 2022.  
        
       
       
        
        Count 3 – Imprisonment for a non-parole period of 6 years to commence on 18 August 2012 and expire on 17 August 2018 and a balance of term of 2 years to expire on 17 August 2020. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 4 – Imprisonment for a non-parole period of 10 years to commence on 18 August 2009 and conclude on 17 August 2019 and a balance of term of 4 years to commence on 18 August 2019 and conclude on 17 August 2023.  
        
       
      
    59 PRICE J: I agree with the Chief Justice and the orders proposed. 
     
      
    60 McCALLUM J: I agree with the Chief Justice and the orders proposed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him in the District Court on 14 August 2008. On 8 May 2008 the applicant pleaded guilty to a charge of robbery in company. The offence is contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 and carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.  
     
      
    2 The applicant was sentenced to a period of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of two years with a balance of term of one year and nine months. He seeks leave to raise the following grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
      1. The honourable trial judge’s sentencing discretion miscarried because he failed to properly or adequately account for the applicant’s subjective features. 
       
       
      2. The honourable trial judge’s sentencing discretion miscarried because he failed properly or adequately to account for the assistance the applicant provided (and was prepared to provide) to authorities in that he only allowed the applicant a discount of 15%. 
       
       
      3. The honourable trail judge imposed a sentence which was, in all the circumstances, manifestly excessive. 
       
       
      Facts 
       
      
    3 There was an agreed statement of facts from which the sentencing judge made the following findings: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender caught a train at Penrith on the evening of 18 January 2007. The co-offender, William Charles Kemp, a young person, CD and the victim Manion Hogan all boarded the train at Penrith. At a point near Mt Victoria railway station the offender, Kemp and CD went and sat near Mr Hogan. The offender asked Mr Hogan for a cigarette and he was given one. CD asked him for some money and when he said he did not have any the offender patted him down, searching for money. 
        
       
       
        
        Kemp started to pull a backpack off Mr Hogan but he resisted, saying that it contained nothing but his mobile. Kemp demanded the phone but Mr Hogan took it out and threw it against the wall of the carriage in order to damage it to prevent it being used. Kemp then kicked Mr Hogan in the head and the offender joined in the kicking and punching. This caused Mr Hogan to fall to the floor of the carriage but the offender and Kemp continued kicking and punching him to the head and upper body. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Hogan somehow managed to trip over one of the attackers and then attempted to get to his feet. At this stage CD jumped on his back and caused him to fall again. The offender and Kemp continued kicking and punching Mr Hogan on the ground. He crept head first under the seat to protect his head. 
        
       
       
        
        By this stage the train was approaching Lithgow. The offender and Kemp took Mr Hogan to a water tap on the train and used Mr Hogan’s t-shirt that had been inside his backpack to throw water and clean up the blood on his face. The offender then threatened Mr Hogan, saying ‘Keep walking. If you go to the cops we’re going to kill you.’ The offender and Mr Kemp sent him to a carriage at the rear of the train. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender, Kemp, CD and the offender’s partner left the train at Lithgow. So did Mr Hogan, a short time later. Mr Hogan did not immediately complain to the police or seek medical attention because he was fearful of the threat that the offender had made. His statement indicates that he went to hospital around midday on 19 January 2007 and went to the police station after that. 
        
       
       
        
        The backpack was found at the offender’s home when police executed a search warrant on 1 March 2007. He participated in a police interview in which he denied participation in the robbery but admitted participation in the assault. He made a statement on 7 May 2008 in which he said that some of the answers he had given in the interview were not truthful and that he was entering a plea of guilty to the charge after receiving legal advice. In his statement the offender made partial admissions to participating in the robbery and he said he was prepared to give evidence for the crown against the co-offender. 
        
       
       
        
        The statement of the treating doctor includes that Mr Hogan had facial bruising and lacerations and multiple abrasions to his upper limbs and chest. He complained of posterior headache, pain to his ribs in the left axillary region and pain to his right renal angle. Photographs taken at the police station on 19 January 2007 provide a good indication of the extent of his injuries.” 
        
       
      
    4 The sentencing judge gave careful consideration to the circumstances of the offence and of the applicant’s involvement in the crime. The applicant pleaded guilty. He did not offer his plea until a week before the date listed for trial. His Honour determined that the sentence should reflect the utilitarian benefit of that plea.  
     
      
    5 At the time of offering his plea the applicant also provided a statement to the police and offered to give evidence against his co-offender. His Honour considered the content of the applicant’s statement and compared it with the statement of agreed facts. He concluded that the applicant’s statement was vague on matters of detail and its value was confined to the fact that it was consistent with the version of events offered by the victim and identified his co-offender. Because the victim was unable to identify his attackers the sentencing judge concluded that the applicant’s evidence would have been of considerable assistance in the prosecution of the co-offender if he had maintained his plea of not guilty. The co-offender apparently changed his plea to guilty when he was informed that the applicant was prepared to give evidence against him.  
     
      
    6 The sentencing judge considered the objective seriousness of the offence having regard to the elements identified by this Court in R v Henry (1999) NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. He concluded that because the violence was sustained by both offenders for quite a time the offence was more serious than a typical case. His Honour emphasised that the offence involved kicking the victim while he was on the ground. 
     
      
    7 With respect to the subjective circumstances of the applicant his Honour identified the fact that he had a criminal history comprising convictions for entering inclosed lands, shoplifting, goods in custody, damaging property and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. There were also traffic matters and a subsequent conviction for assault occasioning actual bodily harm for which he received a two year good behaviour bond. His Honour concluded that although these matters were not as serious as the instant offence the applicant was not entitled to the leniency that might be extended to a first offender. 
     
      
    8 The applicant was aged 22 at the time of the offence. He has little contact with his parents. He is in a domestic relationship with three children and is described as being a positive and supportive father. He left school at 15 and although he has been employed in the past, he has been without employment for a number of years. At the time of the offence he was working as a casual labourer. He has completed a Pathways to Employment Education and Training program. 
     
      
    9 The applicant has a history of abusing alcohol as well as cannabis and amphetamines. He has previously been under the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service which apparently had a positive impact upon his use of these substances. He has also undertaken an Alternative to Violence program and has since reported to a Probation and Parole Officer that as a result he had learned new skills in assisting and controlling anger. 
     
      
    10 His Honour had careful regard to these various matters and expressed the conclusion that the applicant has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation primarily through the counselling and courses he has completed under supervision for the previous assault offence. 
     
      
    11 The applicant did not give evidence before the sentencing judge and his Honour initially found that he could not be satisfied that his expression of remorse should be accepted. When delivering his remarks on sentence his Honour was provided with a letter from the applicant in which he said he was remorseful. However, his Honour remained sceptical of this statement and in particular emphasised the fact that although the offence was committed on 18 January 2007 it took the offender until May of 2008 to enter his plea of guilty. 
     
      
    12 His Honour found special circumstances being the fact that the applicant was to be imprisoned for the first time and a need for assistance in finding employment and re-establishing his life upon release. 
     
      
    13 The applicant submitted that the discount which his Honour provided for the plea of guilty and assistance was erroneously low. That submission must be rejected. The plea of guilty was entered during the week that the matter had been listed for trial. Although his Honour did not identify a precise discount for the plea a discount of 10% was not inappropriate. With respect to the assistance given to authorities his Honour determined that this should have been at the lower end of the range of 15 - 25%. It would seem that his Honour allowed 15% for assistance. His Honour provided a total discount of 25%. 
     
      
    14 This Court considered in detail the appropriate approach to any discount for assistance to authorities in R v Sukkar (2006) 172 A Crim R 151. The leading judgment was that of Howie J with which I concurred. In that judgment Howie J said at [5]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It seems to me that the courts should now acknowledge the reality of the situation and reduce the range of discount to reflect the fact that one of the bases of the discount is no longer generally applicable. In my opinion discounts for a plea and assistance of more than 40 per cent should be very exceptionally, if at all, granted in a case where there is no evidence that the offender will spend the sentence, or a substantial part of it, in more onerous conditions than the general prison population. It should now be accepted that an offender who has provided assistance will not necessarily be disadvantaged in the prison system and, if the offender wishes to assert otherwise, he or she should lead evidence of that fact.” 
        
       
      
    15 In Sukkar Latham J observed that a combined discount of 50% for a plea of guilty and assistance to authorities would only be appropriate where the assistance was of high order. In SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19; 168 A Crim R 249 Howie J stated that a combined discount for a plea of guilty and for assistance should not normally exceed 50%. 
     
      
    16 In my opinion having regard to the features identified by the sentencing judge a discount for assistance in the order of 15% was within the appropriate range in the circumstances of this case. In the absence of any evidence of risk to the applicant or any other detriment to him, in particular difficulties within the prison system, a greater discount would have been difficult to justify. 
     
      
    17 With respect to the applicant’s subjective features it was submitted by his counsel that although the sentencing judge identified various subjective matters he did not state how and in what way those matters were to be reflected in the sentence. It was submitted that the severity of the sentence imposed indicated that his Honour failed to attribute sufficient regard to the applicant’s subjective case, in particular his prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    18 To my mind this submission must be rejected. His honour identified with clarity the relevant features of the applicant’s subjective case. He determined that by reason of his previous offending he was not entitled to leniency but that because of his response in the past to counselling and education programs he had reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. Although his Honour was not satisfied that he was remorseful his Honour nevertheless recognised the fact that the applicant had provided assistance to the authorities which his Honour said was the most significant aspect of the applicant’s case. 
     
      
    19 Before this Court in oral submission, the applicant’s counsel, in support of the submission that his Honour had failed to properly or adequately consider the applicant’s subjective features, drew attention to the sentence which was imposed upon the applicant’s co-offender, although an argument in support of a submission that the applicant was entitled to a justifiable sense of grievance in relation to his co-offender’s sentence, was not put forward. It was submitted that error in sentencing the applicant could be demonstrated by the fact that his Honour identified that the co-offender was entitled to a lesser sentence by reason of his particular subjective circumstances, in particular his intellectual disability, the circumstances of his custody and his lack of record of significant previous convictions, his remorse, and goods prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    20 Having identified those matters, his Honour said of the present applicant that in relation to his subjective circumstances, the most significant aspect was the assistance which he had given to the authorities. This Court has been provided with his Honour’s remarks on sentence in relation to the co-offender and it would seem that the findings which his Honour made when passing sentence on the applicant, were appropriate. To my mind, no error is revealed by reason of a comparison of the circumstances of the applicant with those of his co-offender.  
     
      
    21 When considering the appropriate sentence for the applicant his Honour was mindful of the guideline judgment of this Court in Henry. The guideline provided in that case incorporated a discount of about 10% for a late plea of guilty. The sentencing judge assessed the present matter as being more serious than the typical case in Henry because of the sustained level of violence perpetrated by the applicant and his co-offender. Despite this assessment it is apparent that his Honour commenced consideration of the appropriate sentence at five years which is in the middle range suggested in the Henry guidelines. The applicant committed the offence while he was subjected to a bond. Although his Honour recognised this fact he made no reference to it as an aggravating factor. I am satisfied that having regard to both the objective criminality and the applicant’s personal circumstances the sentence which his Honour imposed was well within the appropriate range. When consideration is given to the fact that the applicant was, at the relevant time on a bond a more severe sentence would not have been unreasonable. 
     
      
    22 Although I would grant leave to appeal the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    23 HIDDEN J: I agree. 
     
      
    24 McCALLUM J: I also agree. 
     
      
    25 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The orders of the court are accordingly as I have proposed.

    CRIMINAL PROCEDURE – Summary proceedings – Withdrawal of charge by prosecutor – Resulting dismissal of charge – No right in accused to Certificate of Dismissal which would bar later proceedings on the same charge 
     
     HEADNOTE 
    In 2004 the appellant was charged in the Children’s Court with a sexual offence which was triable summarily. He was then charged with the malicious infliction of actual bodily harm which could not be tried in the Children’s Court. In 2005 following his committal for trial on the latter charge the prosecutor withdrew the summary charge. Section 208 of the Criminal Procedure Act prior to its amendment in 2007 provided that a charge withdrawn by the prosecutor “is taken to be dismissed”. The appellant applied for and was granted a certificate of dismissal which, if valid, would operate under s 206 to bar further proceedings for the relevant offence. Adams J ordered that the Certificate be quashed for lack of jurisdiction. On appeal by the accused HELD: (1) The decision to quash the certificate was correct; (2) An entitlement to an order of dismissal and a certificate of dismissal only arose following a decision of the Court to dismiss the charge; (3) There had been no such decision in this case; (4) A dismissal under s 208 consequent on withdrawal of the charge by the prosecutor did not create any right to an order of dismissal or to a certificate of dismissal under s 205(1).

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HANDLEY AJA: This is an appeal as of right by an accused person from the judgment of Adams J who ordered that a Certificate of Dismissal signed by the Registrar of the Children’s Court be quashed for want of jurisdiction. The appeal as of right is sought to be supported under s 101(1)(a) of the Supreme Court Act but this is expressed to be subject to the Act. Section 101(2), which is the dominant provision, denies appeals as of right in cases within para (r) where the appeal does not involve an amount of $100,000 or more. 2 This is such a case and the appellant did not have an appeal as of right. However the proposed appeal raises a significant question and in my opinion the court should grant leave to appeal and this is not opposed by counsel for the respondent.3 The proceedings arise out of a charge of sexual intercourse with a female under the age of sixteen without her consent brought against the appellant in the Children’s Court in September 2004. This was followed in October that year by a charge of malicious infliction of actual bodily harm on the same victim on the same occasion. The first charge could be tried summarily in the Children’s Court but the second could not. The Children’s Court heard the committal proceedings on the second charge on 12 April 2005 and the appellant was committed for trial. The magistrate then dealt with the first charge and the transcript records the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: Yes, what do you want me to do with sequence 1? 
        
       
       
        
        STEEDMAN: We’re withdrawing sequence 1, the … (not transcribable) … 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Sorry? 
        
       
       
        
        STEEDMAN: I seek to withdraw sequence 1. 
        
       
       
        
        WALSH: Yes, no objection to that your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Okay, well I WILL WITHDRAW THAT AND DISCHARGE THE DEFENDANT.” 
        
       
      
    4 The Director of Public Prosecutions elected not to proceed on the charge of maliciously inflicting actual bodily harm and filed an ex officio indictment on the original charge. This provoked a challenge to the jurisdiction of the District Court which was ultimately resolved by the High Court in PM v The Queen [2007] HCA 49; 82 ALJR 57. Meanwhile on 30 January 2007 the Registrar of the Children’s Court signed a Certificate of Dismissal of the first charge purporting to exercise the power conferred by s 205 of the Criminal Procedure Act. This was the certificate quashed by Adams J.5 The certificate states that on 12 April 2005 the first charge  
     
      
       
        
         “was considered by John Ormonde CRAWFORD, one of her Majesty’s Magistrates in and for the said State, and was dismissed”. 
        
       
      
      
    6 The relevant provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act prior to the Criminal Legislation Amendment Act (No 57 of 2007) were ss 202, 205, 206 and 208. Sections 205 and 208 were significantly amended by the 2007 Act. Unfortunately Adams J referred to these sections in their amended form but cl 16 of sch 1 of the 2007 Act expressly provided that the amendments to those sections “apply only to the dismissal of a matter on or after the commencement of the amendments”. Sections 205 and 208 in their unamended form provided:  
     
      
       
        
        “205 
         
        (1) A Court may make an order of dismissal and give the accused person a certificate certifying that a matter has been dismissed if it decides to dismiss the matter. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) A Court must make an order of dismissal and give the accused person a certificate certifying that a matter has been dismissed if requested to do so by an accused person against whom a matter has been dismissed or by the prosecutor. 
        
       
       
        
        208 
         
        If a matter is withdrawn by the prosecutor, the matter is taken to be dismissed and the accused person is taken to be discharged in relation to the offences concerned.” 
        
       
      
     Section 206 deals with the effect of a certificate and provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “A certificate certifying that a matter has been dismissed, if produced and without any further proofs being required, prevents any later proceedings in any court for the same matter against the same person.” 
        
       
      
    7 The transcript for 12 April 2005 makes it absolutely clear that the first charge was withdrawn by the prosecutor without any adjudication by the magistrate. The transcript records the magistrate saying “Okay, well I will withdraw that and discharge the defendant”. The magistrate could not withdraw the charge. He could only note that it was withdrawn by the prosecutor. In the context the magistrate could only have said or meant to say that the withdrawal by the prosecutor was noted. He either made a slip of the tongue or the transcript was incorrect, but in either case it does not matter, the prosecutor withdrew the charge, no-one else.8 Section 208 as in force in 2005 dealt with the withdrawal by the prosecutor and provided in that event that “the matter is taken to be dismissed”. Section 205, as then in force, entitled an accused person to a certificate if the court made “an order of dismissal”.9 Section 202(1) and (2) deal with the functions of the court in summary proceedings as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “(1) The court must determine summary proceedings after hearing the accused person, prosecutor, witnesses and evidence in accordance with this Act. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The court may determine the matter by convicting the accused person or making an order as to the accused person, or by dismissing the matter.” 
        
       
      
    10 This indicates the nature of the order of dismissal referred to in s 205(1). In the present case the Children’s Court did not make “an order of dismissal” and did not “decide to dismiss the matter”. There was no trial, no evidence and no adjudication.11 A dismissal under s 208 does not flow from any order or decision of the court. It takes effect automatically on the withdrawal of the case by the prosecutor. This was ultimately accepted by Mr Walsh who appeared for the appellant. His submission, relevantly, was that after a dismissal under s 208, the accused could ask the court for an order of dismissal. Section 205(2) required the court to make that order which would create a right to a certificate. 
     
      
    12 This submission does not reflect the true construction and operation of these sections. Section 205(2) refers to an order of dismissal of the kind provided for in s 202(2) and 205(1), that is an order of dismissal consequent upon an adjudication by the court. In my judgment an accused person who has been the beneficiary of a dismissal under s 208 has no right to a certificate under s 205(2).13 An automatic dismissal following withdrawal by the prosecutor was not an actual or deemed decision which attracts an entitlement to a certificate under s 205. The court was referred to a dictum of Basten JA in Director of Public Prosecutions v PM [2006] NSWCCA 297 67 NSWLR 46, paras [15-16] which appears to support the submissions of the appellant. However the majority judgment was that of Latham J in which Whealy J concurred, and she did not comment on the present point.14 The court has been informed by Mr Walsh, who appeared with a leader in the Court of Criminal Appeal, that the point was not argued there or in the High Court.15 Having had the benefit of the reasons of Adams J, and the written and oral submissions in this Court, I have reached a different conclusion and respectfully disagree with this dictum.  
     
      
    16 There is no need to invoke the common law defence of autrefois acquit considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Gilham v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 323 or the statutory antecedents of the provisions now in question because the sections are clear and speak for themselves.  
     
      
    17 The appellant, in my judgment, was not entitled to a certificate and, despite his reference to ss 205 and 208 in their amended form, the decision of Adams J to quash the certificate was correct. I would therefore propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Leave to appeal granted with effect from 3 March 2008 when the notice of appeal was filed without leave. 
         
        2. Dispense with further compliance with the Rules. 
         
        3 Appeal dismissed. No order as to costs. 
         
        
       
      
    18 GILES JA: I agree with Justice Handley’s reasons and with the orders his Honour proposes.19 CAMPBELL JA: I agree with both the reasons and the proposed orders of Justice Handley.

     Adam Graham Carney v Regina 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: The appellant stood trial on 19 September 2007 at Dubbo District Court on an indictment containing six sexual assault charges. The jury returned verdicts of not guilty on three out of six counts. He appeals from the convictions on the other three counts being one count of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900 and two counts of indecent assault contrary to s 61L of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
    2 On the Crown case there were two occasions on each of which the Crown alleged three sexual assaults took place. The appellant was then aged 23 and the complainant was then aged 16. 
     
      
    3 The complainant was visiting a rural property on 3 January 2006. On the Crown case, during the evening the appellant masturbated the complainant’s penis, the first count, digitally penetrated the complainant’s anus, the second count, and forced him to masturbate the appellant, the third count. The jury found the appellant not guilty on counts one and two and guilty on count three. 
     
      
    4 The second occasion was between 9 January and 16 January 2006 when the complainant was again visiting the rural property. On the Crown case the appellant masturbated the complainant, count four, inserted his finger into the anus of the complainant, count five, and forced the complainant to masturbate him, count six. The jury found the appellant not guilty on count four and guilty on counts five and six.5 The appellant did not give evidence but relied on his interview with the police. In that interview he denied the digital penetration alleged in count two but admitted the remaining sexual activity. He said that the complainant consented, indeed, that he had instigated the sexual contact. 
     
      
    6 There are two grounds of appeal. They were treated together in the submissions before the court. The grounds are: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ground 1 The convictions were unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence, as in the particular and relevant circumstances those verdicts are inconsistent with the verdicts returned in relation to the remaining three counts on the indictment. There is no reasonable basis for the inconsistency. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        Ground 2 There was a miscarriage of justice, as the jury’s failure to extend the doubt on three of the six counts to the remaining three counts, in the particular and relevant circumstances of this trial, is indicative of such compromise or error of approach as to justify the intervention of the Court and the quashing of the convictions.” 
        
       
      
    7 The relevant legal principles were not in issue. With respect to inconsistency, the court must bear in mind the primary responsibility of the jury to decide guilt or innocence. The approach is, and I quote from MacKenzie v The Queen (1996) 190 CLR 348 at 367: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … if there is a proper way by which the appellate court may reconcile the verdicts, allowing it to conclude that the jury performed their functions as required, that conclusion will generally be accepted.” 
        
       
      
    8 As frequently occurs, this is a word against word case. However, the fact that the jury does not convict on the basis of some part of the complainant’s evidence does not of itself establish a relevant inconsistency. The whole of the circumstances of the case must be considered. 
     
      
    9 As the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ said in MFA v The Queen (2002) 213 CLR 606 at [34]: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the case of sexual offences, of which there may be no objective evidence, some, or all, of the members of a jury may require some supporting evidence before they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the word of a complainant. This may not be unreasonable. It does not necessarily involve a rejection of the complainant’s evidence. A juror might consider it more probable than not that a complainant is telling the truth but require something additional before reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt. The criminal trial procedure is designed to reinforce, in jurors, a sense of the seriousness of their task, and of the heavy burden of proof undertaken by the prosecution. A verdict of not guilty does not necessarily imply that a complainant has been disbelieved, or a want of confidence in the complainant. It may simply reflect a cautious approach to the discharge of a heavy responsibility. In addition to want of supporting evidence, other factors that might cause a jury to draw back from reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt in relation to some aspects of a complainant’s evidence might be that the complainant has shown some uncertainty as to matters of detail, or has been shown to have a faulty recollection of some matters, or has been shown otherwise to be more reliable about some parts of his or her evidence than about others.” 
        
       
      
      
    10 The appellant submitted that in this case the inconsistent verdicts were: “an affront to logic and commonsense”, adopting the formulation in MacKenzie at 368 and referred to with approval in the joint judgment of McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ in MFA at [86].11 With respect to count two, there was a clear denial by the appellant unlike each other sexual contact which he admitted but said was consensual. The acquittal with respect to that count is clearly based on a difference in the evidence of a direct and material character. 
     
      
    12 With respect to the remaining five counts, the only issue was consent. The question for this court is whether there is a relevant inconsistency between the acquittal on the two remaining counts and the three counts upon which a conviction was entered. 
     
      
    13 The Crown in its submissions sought to reconcile the verdicts and in doing so did not seek to invoke the last of the three matters referred to by Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ in MFA at [34] being a matter which may interact with the other considerations to which their Honours referred, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … it may appear to a jury, that, although a number of offences have been alleged, justice is met by convicting an accused of some only”. 
        
       
      
    14 This case does not raise the application of that aspect of the judgment. 
     
      
    15 The Crown emphasised a number of directions which the trial judge had given to the jury in the course of his summing-up, particularly, the jury had to assess the evidence relating to each charge separately and to reach separate verdicts on each count in a context in which: 
     
      
       
        
        “The evidence in relation to different charges is somewhat peculiar to each charge” 
        
       
      
    and: 
     
      
       
        
        “There are some facets of the evidence which relate solely to a particular count.” 
        
       
      
    Then if the jury did: 
     
      
       
        
        “Hold a reasonable doubt in relation to a particular count where you find a particular count not proved, then these are matters that you will take into consideration when considering the next count.” 
        
       
      
    Then his Honour said it was “essential” that the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “carefully scrutinise the complainant’s evidence.” 
        
       
      
    16 Finally, with respect to each count the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the sexual intercourse occurred without the consent of the complainant and that the accused knew that there was no such consent. 
     
      
    17 As I have indicated above, the acquittal on count two is in a separate category. There was a clear basis for differentiating it from the counts on which the appellant was convicted. 
     
      
    18 The Crown submissions with respect to the acquittals on counts one and four drew attention to certain common features between these two counts which distinguished both from the three counts on which the jury convicted the appellant. 
     
      
    19 Each of count one and count four involved the appellant masturbating the complainant to the point of ejaculation. These circumstances were quite distinct from, most relevantly, counts three and six upon which the jury convicted. Each of those counts alleged a forced masturbation of the appellant by the complainant. 
     
      
    20 The Crown draws attention to the fact with respect to count one the complainant did not initially make any mention of the events when he first gave his evidence-in-chief. He was drawn back to it by the Crown Prosecutor. 
     
      
    21 After recounting the relevant events in chronological sequence being the matters involved in counts two and three, the following questions and answers occurred in evidence-in-chief: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Are they the only two types of activity you and Adam did together that night on the mattress? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I sort of can’t remember it all. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Okay. Is there anything that you remember that you haven’t told the court about?  
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What’s that? 
        
       
       
        
        A. That he was trying to kiss me and he put lips with mine.” 
        
       
      
    22 Accordingly, on a second occasion, the complainant failed to give the relevant evidence. 
     
      
    23 Subsequently, after giving the evidence with respect to the second occasion, namely the occasion involving counts four, five and six about the same kind of activity, that is the appellant masturbating him, that is count four, the following occurred in the course of the trial: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You’ve given evidence about him touching your penis on the second occasion. Did he touch your penis on the first occasion or can’t you remember? That other trip? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I think he did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When did that occur? Before or after he touched your bottom? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Before. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How long did he touch your penis on that first occasion? 
        
       
       
        
        A. About ten, fifteen minutes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you ejaculate on that occasion? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes.” 
        
       
      
    24 The Crown submitted that there was a similar hesitation in the evidence with respect to count four. Again the evidence was adduced chronologically but the reference to touching the complainant’s penis was not given until after the evidence about counts five and six. 
     
      
    25 Immediately after the evidence of the act of masturbation by the complainant of the appellant, the following evidence was given: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. What about your penis? Did anyone touch that? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes, Adam. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When did that happen? On this night? Did he touch your penis on the night we’re talking about? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes, he did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did that happen before or after he put his fingers into your bottom? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I think that was before he was putting his fingers in my bottom.” 
        
       
      
    He went on to give evidence that on this occasion also he ejaculated. 
     
      
    26 Significantly, with respect to the issue of knowledge of absence of consent is the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. How long did he touch your penis for? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Five, ten minutes as I was trying to move away from him to stop doing it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What were you doing to stop him doing it? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Sort of pushing away from him, tried to push away from him. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did anyone say anything while this activity took place? Did you say anything, or Adam? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No, not that I can remember.” 
        
       
      
    27 It is noted above, the evidence about count one was given out of sequence after this evidence. With respect to knowledge of absence of consent, the complainant’s evidence was this: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did you say anything at the time to him on that first occasion? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I just said, ‘Stop it, let me go. I want to get up.’ He wouldn’t let me up. 
        
       
      
    28 This is clear evidence on the issue of knowledge but as noted, this evidence was given out of sequence and with apparent hesitation. Although there was no issue that the events occurred, this quality of the evidence may have been permissibly regarded as relevant by the jury on the issue of communication of a lack of consent. 
     
      
    29 The Crown also referred to the fact that in the initial complaint to police, the complainant had made no reference to the events constituting counts one and four being the two occasions on which the appellant masturbated him to ejaculation. The Crown submits that he was clearly embarrassed by these events and ashamed about these incidents, both in his initial complaint to the police and also in the course of giving evidence at the trial. 
     
      
    30 I agree that the jury was entitled to proceed on the basis that whilst accepting the complainant generally as a witness of truth, the evidence on counts one and four did not satisfy them beyond a reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    31 These two occasions raise a distinctive issue as to the knowledge that was required on the part of the appellant, namely knowledge that the complainant was not consenting. Each of the two counts involved masturbation by the appellant of the complaint for a considerable period up to and including ejaculation. It was in my opinion open to the jury to conclude that in these two incidents the appellant may not have had the requisite knowledge. Whatever indications of absence of consent had been given by the complainant, the jury could reasonably conclude that they were not persisted with in this respect. 
     
      
    32 Count five involved digital penetration of the anus which the appellant did not deny but said was consensual. By its nature it was open to the jury in my opinion to find that the appellant knew that the complainant did not consent, unlike the counts of masturbation leading to ejaculation by the complainant. 
     
      
    33 The evidence of this count was given without hesitation. On the issue of knowledge, the complainant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. What were you doing while he was doing this? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I was trying to push myself away. He had his hand like that over this side of me and pulling me back in towards him.” 
        
       
      
    34 In my opinion, there was no relevant inconsistency in the verdicts which would justify this court interfering with a jury verdict. At least with respect to the obligation upon the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew that the complainant was not consenting, the three counts on which he was acquitted were relevantly different to those on which he was convicted.  
     
      
    35 The evidence as to the communication of lack of consent on count four was equivocal and with respect to count one could be regarded as insufficiently reliable. With respect to count two where there was a denial, the matters set out in the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ in MFA which I have quoted above are directly applicable. 
     
      
    36 However, I place particular weight on the fact that the masturbation continued until ejaculation with respect to both counts one and four. A jury could well conclude that the Crown had not established beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant realised that the complainant was not consenting to those acts. 
     
      
    37 In my opinion, there is no relevant inconsistency. With respect to the assertion of unreasonableness, the test in M v The Queen (1997) 181 CLR 487 at 493 is not satisfied. 
     
      
    38 The appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    39 HIDDEN J: I agree. 
     
      
    40 LATHAM J: I also agree. 
     
      
    41 SPIGELMAN CJ: The order of the Court is as I have indicated.

     HEADNOTE 
    The appellant injured his hand on razor sharp metal protruding from stainless steel panels on the door of his refrigerator. The refrigerator had been imported but the panels had been fitted by the respondent in Australia. The appellant sued the respondent for damages under s 75AD of the Trade Practices Act which makes a manufacturer who supplies defective goods liable to any person injured by the goods. It was common grounds that the respondent was the manufacturer but the trial judge held that it had not supplied the goods. On appeal HELD: The respondent had not supplied the refrigerator. It had worked on the goods as a licensee in the premises of another but had never had possession of them and had not delivered them to anyone.

     Judgment 
    1 BELL JA: I will ask Handley AJA to give the first judgment. 
     
      
    2 HANDLEY AJA: This is an appeal by the plaintiff from a judgment for the defendant, entered by Balla DCJ, in an action for personal injuries under s 75AD of the Trade Practices Act. The plaintiff was cleaning the stainless steel panels on the front of his new Maytag refrigerator when a finger of his right hand was cut on a razor-like burr on the bottom of one of the panels.3 The trial judge is to be congratulated for her clear and concise findings of fact, which have not been challenged on the appeal. The only issue, one of mixed fact and law, is whether the defendant supplied the refrigerator within the meaning of s 75AD. Her Honour held that it had not done so and the section did not apply to the defendant.4 The two-door refrigerator was manufactured in the United States and imported by the first cross-defendant Maytag Australia Pty Limited. It was delivered to a warehouse, operated by an organisation described as M3 Logistics, which was not otherwise identified. The arrangements under which Maytag Australia could store refrigerators and stainless steel panels on those premises, and arrange for work to be carried out on them, were not proved.5 The refrigerators were black and, to improve their marketability in Australia the doors were covered in stainless steel cladding. The panels were sold by the second cross-defendant to Maytag Australia and delivered to the warehouse. The defendant was engaged by Maytag Australia to fix the panels to the refrigerators which were then delivered to retailers. The plaintiff purchased his refrigerator from Harvey Norman in 2003.6 The defendant fixed the panels to the refrigerator in the warehouse. The panels were available to the defendant from pallets. The defendant did not acquire title to the refrigerators or the panels. Its contract was for work and labour as is evidenced by the purchase order and its invoice.7 The defendant’s work was carried out on the premises of another. While it had access to the refrigerators and the panels to enable it to carry out the work, and could move the goods within those premises for the purpose of working on them, in my judgment it never had possession of those goods. They remained at all relevant times on premises belonging to a third party, on which the defendant's employees entered and remained as mere licensees. The defendant was not entitled to remove the refrigerators or the panels from those premises, and did not have dominion over them.8 In my judgment, the defendant never became a bailee of the refrigerator because it did not have possession. It never had a lien on the refrigerator for its charges.9 Mr Rayment QC, who appeared for the appellant, referred to the discussion in Palmer on Bailment at p 501 and following dealing with bailment for hire of work and labour. Such a bailment occurs when a chattel is delivered by the bailor to the bailee for the purpose of having work done on it. However, as Palmer points out, there can be no bailment in such a case unless possession of the chattel is given to the party bound to do the work.10 The point may be tested by considering the position of a subcontractor called in to do work on goods in the factory of the general manufacturer. In my judgment such a subcontractor would not have possession of the goods while he was working on them even if no-one else was working on them at the same time. 11 The issue is whether, in the circumstances outlined, the defendant supplied the refrigerator within the meaning of s 75AD which provides:  
     
      
       
        
        “If: 
         
        (a) a corporation, in trade or commerce, supplies goods manufactured by it; and 
         
        (b) they have a defect; and 
        
        
        (c) because of the defect, an individual suffers injuries;  
         
        then: 
         
        (d) the corporation is liable to compensate the individual for the amount of the individual’s loss suffered as a result of the injuries; and 
         
        (e) the individual may recover that amount by action against the corporation; …” 
        
       
      
    12 Manufactured as defined in s 75AA includes ""assembled"". The judge found that the defendant was a manufacturer because it had assembled the refrigerator in its final form by fixing the panels to it. The defendant has not challenged this finding. Section 4(1) defines supply as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        supply 
        , when used as a verb, includes: 
         
          
          (a) in relation to goods – supply (including re-supply) by way of sale, exchange, lease, hire or hire-purchase; … 
           
          and, when used as a noun, has a corresponding meaning, and  
          supplied 
           and  
          supplier  
          have corresponding meanings.”  
          
         
        
       
      
    13 Section 4C provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears: 
         
         … 
         
        (c) a reference to the supply of goods includes a reference to the supply of goods together with other property or services, or both; 
         
        …  
         
        (e) a reference to the re-supply of goods acquired from a person includes a reference to: 
         
          
          (i) a supply of the goods to another person in an altered form or condition; and 
           
          (ii) a supply to another person of goods in which the first-mentioned goods have been incorporated; …” 
           
            
          
         
        
       
      
    14 Section 75AD does not require the manufacturer to supply the goods directly to the plaintiff. Supply to any person in the contractual chain will suffice, but the section does not apply to every manufacturer. It only applies to a manufacturer who supplied the goods. The defendant supplied services under its contract for work and labour, but there appears to be no section corresponding to s 75AD dealing with the supply of services, and in any event the defendant was only sued under s 75AD. 15 The definition of supply is inclusive, and its normal meaning is available to the appellant. Its normal meaning was considered in Symes v Stewart (1920) 28 CLR 386 and held to include delivery by a bailee to his bailor. In Commonwealth of Australia v Sterling Nicholas Duty Free Pty Ltd (1971), 126 CLR 297 its normal meaning was held to include delivery by a seller to the buyer after the property had passed. In Ex parteTurner re Hardy (1947) 48 SR 133,135 Jordan CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Supplied … has, I think, the meaning which it has in common parlance, namely, provided by or on behalf of a person to whom the thing belongs to someone to whom it does not or did not belong.” 
        
       
      
    16 We have also been referred to other authorities dealing with the ordinary meaning of the word including Cook v Pasminco Ltd (2000) 99 FCR 548, 552, a case under s 75AD, where Lindgren J, after referring to the statutory definition of supply, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is true, as counsel for the applicants points out, that the definition is an inclusory one but it seems to me that an essential element of supply is that it is a bilateral and consensual process: … The definitions of ‘supply’ and ‘acquire’ are symmetrical: a supply of goods must occur as part of a bilateral ‘transaction’ or dealing under which the other party acquires them.”  
         
        
       
      
    17 While the defendant's contract with Maytag Australia was a bilateral business transaction in trade and commerce, it was not by way of sale, exchange, lease, hire or hire purchase or any analogous transaction within the definition of supply in s 4 (1) and Maytag Australia did not acquire the goods from the defendant.18 Although there was a supply of services by the defendant to Maytag Australia in my judgment there was no supply of goods. The refrigerator was never in the defendant’s possession and when the defendant finished its work it did not deliver or re-deliver the refrigerator to Maytag Australia. As Mr Al-Masri said in his evidence the defendant's employees walked away leaving the refrigerator where it was. It may have been moved in the course of carrying out the work, but there was nothing in the nature of a re-delivery. The refrigerator was simply left where it was.19 When the defendant completed its work and its employees left the premises of M3 Logistics it did not supply the refrigerator to Maytag Australia or anyone else.20 Section 75AD does not apply to persons, such as the defendant, who work on goods under contract without ever acquiring title to, or possession of the goods. In my judgment the trial judge was correct for substantially the reasons she gave and the appeal must be dismissed. 21 BELL JA: I agree with the orders proposed by Justice Handley for the reasons that his Honour has given.22 BARR J: I also agree.23 BELL JA: The orders of the Court will be appeal dismissed. The appellant is to pay the first respondent's costs of the appeal, and the second and third respondents have liberty to apply.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an appeal by the Crown asserting the manifest inadequacy of sentences imposed by Solomon DCJ in Sydney District Court. Between 12 and 19 August 2008 the respondent stood trial on an indictment charging dishonestly damaging property by fire and two counts of making a false statement with intent to obtain a financial advantage. The prescribed maximum penalties for those offences are 14 years and 5 years imprisonment respectively. 
     
      
    2 As he was entitled, the respondent did not give evidence at trial but, after conviction, he gave evidence and agreed that he now accepted that he “participated in the offence” of which he had been found guilty by the jury. On 14 October 2008 his solicitors had arranged for him to be examined by a psychologist Dr Rowe, who prepared a report which was tendered in evidence. The respondent had read the report and testified that it provoked an insight and a realization to him of why he committed the offences. 
     
      
    3 On 17 October 2008 his Honour imposed sentences of 12 months, 6 months and 3 months imprisonment in respect of the sequence of offences, all of which he suspended pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    4 In about August 2005 the respondent had negotiated the purchase of a business, which operated as a convenience store in Parramatta. He entered a lease with the owner of the premises (who was not the vendor of the business) and became obligated in respect of rent. On 2 November 2005 the respondent made a proposal to Australian Unity General Insurance for a business insurance policy which was accepted and a policy issued. The policy provided for a burglary cover of $30,000 and a fire cover of $55,000. Pursuant to the policy however, the latter was split into ingredients amounting to cover of $5,000 for stock, $20,000 for tobacco products and $30,000 for other store contents. 
     
      
    5 The business was not successful and the respondent fell into immediate arrears of rent and he renegotiated with the landlord.  
     
      
    6 The respondent was a user of the prohibited drug heroin. About one week prior to 27 December 2005 he spoke to David Burrell-Jones, a heroin addict from whom he occasionally obtained the drug. He asked him about “doing an insurance job” on the convenience store. The respondent agreed to pay him $10,000 to set fire to the store. Burrell-Jones enlisted George Lyras, another heroin addict, to assist him in return for a half share in the promised fee, which was to be sourced from an anticipated insurance payout. 
     
      
    7 The respondent obviously became aware of the intended participation of Lyras, and on the night of 26-27 December he drove both of them to a service station where Burrell-Jones purchased a can of petrol. The group then proceeded to the store at Parramatta. The respondent remained in the vehicle and the other two entered the store. 
     
      
    8 Burrell-Jones spread the petrol about the premises. Lyras proceeded to gather some cigarettes which he intended to take. There was a misunderstanding between them and Burrell-Jones ignited the petrol and Lyras became trapped in the resultant fire. His clothes became inflamed and naked and badly burned, he made an escape from the building. Burrell-Jones drove him to Westmead Hospital and loaned him a pair of shorts so that he could walk into the accident and emergency centre. Once Lyras had done this the other two left. The respondent was at the time riding in the passenger seat. Lyras was admitted to hospital and later transferred to Concord Hospital Burns Unit.  
     
      
    9 Burrell-Jones drove to Warwick Farm where he alighted from the vehicle and the respondent took over and drove himself home. 
     
      
    10 Burrell-Jones and Lyras were arrested and charged with dishonestly damaging property by a fire with a view to financial gain. They each pleaded guilty. Burrell-Jones appeared before Ellis DCJ at Parramatta District Court on 30 July 2007 and he was released upon entering a bond pursuant to s 9 of the sentencing legislation to be of good behaviour for 2 years. Lyras was dealt with in the Drug Court and on 28 February 2008 he was sentenced for this offence to a total term of 9 months with a non-parole period of 3 months.  
     
      
    11 It is important to note that, although the unintended injuries suffered by Lyras may have been available to him as a factor in mitigation: Alameddine v R [2006] NSWCCA 317, the suffering of those injuries by Lyras was no element of any offence for which the respondent stood for sentence, nor was it any element of the charges against him that human life was endangered. 
     
      
    12 The facts in relation to the false statement charges were similar in that in claim forms which the respondent was asked to complete by the insurance assessor he indicated in the negative to inquiry as to whether he knew who caused the loss. 
     
      
    13 These were far from being the respondent’s first offences. Inter alia, in 1988 he was sentenced to 2 years 6 months imprisonment at Liverpool District Court for robbery. In March 2003 he was sentenced for offences of attempting to possess trafficable quantities of ecstasy and cocaine, to concurrent imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 5 March 2002 with a balance term of 1 year commencing on 5 March 2004. It can be observed that the current offences occurred within one year of expiry of those sentences. 
     
      
    14 In the proceedings after conviction his Honour referred to some of the content of Dr Rowe’s report and expressed an anticipation that it might be submitted that the respondent’s participation in the offences were as a result of the existence, in Dr Rowe’s psychological opinion, of psychiatric conditions labelled as attention deficit disorder and a bi-polar condition or both of them. Following an exchange about this with counsel, and an adjournment, his Honour was informed that counsel had been instructed that “the offender admits his participation in the crime”. The respondent then gave evidence and confirmed that he had given those instructions. 
     
      
    15 The respondent claimed that Dr Rowe’s opinion was a revelation to him provoking, as I have remarked, an insight into his offending. It might also be observed that he had been interviewed by a probation and parole officer shortly before he saw Dr Rowe. That officer reported: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Houri attempted to minimise his role in the offences, stating that he was not guilty of lighting the fire, and attempting to implicate others as the main offenders. He showed little insight into the causes of, nor effect of his offending behaviour on himself or his family.” 
        
       
      
    16 It is, of course, literally accurate that the respondent did not light the fire, but in the circumstances that was scarcely a matter which mitigated the respondent’s culpability. His Honour found that the applicant planned the fire and co-opted Burrell-Jones to light it. Although his Honour found that these were serious offences and noted the prescribed maximum penalties, after reciting some extracts from Dr Rowe’s report he stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “On considering the evidence pertinent to count 1 and considering the mental condition of the offender I regard the offence to be at the low end of the scale of objective seriousness for the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        I now look to the objective seriousness of the offences contained in counts 2 and 3 of the indictment. I am not going to repeat the findings of Dr Rowe nor am I going to repeat what I said in relation to the evidence given by the offender. It is clear that the offender was not thinking rationally or clearly due to his mental conditions at the time of his completing the insurance claim forms. I regard the offences to be at the low end of the scale of objective seriousness for the offences.” 
        
       
      
    17 With respect to those expressed views, any mental condition of an offender is subjective to that person and does not provide a factor of the objective seriousness of an offence. The offence was objectively serious. In any event, Dr Rowe had stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is, in my opinion, important to emphasis (sic) that the precise nature of these mental illnesses has remained undiagnosed and untreated. I can only conclude that if Mr Houri’s BD, ADD and substance abuse had been adequately treated using the regime which I have described above, he would not have committed the offences.” 
        
       
      
    18 There is an apparency of a gap in logic in concluding that conditions of an undiagnosed nature would have in fact inhibited the commission of voluntary acts of criminality. The assertion, upon analysis, is in essence no more than a guess. 
     
      
    19 Ignoring the lenience which emerged upon the suspension of sentences the assessment of 12 months, 6 months and 3 months imprisonment failed by a considerable margin to reflect the objective seriousness of these offences. 
     
      
    20 It was argued, as had been canvassed at trial, that the $5,000 limit on insurance recovery for stock pursuant to the policy (after exclusion of tobacco and other store contents), when the loss of stock had been estimated at $30,000 showed a defect in reasoning which was at least supportive of Dr Rowe’s views. As noted, the respondent himself did not give evidence at trial and in the post conviction proceedings when he did testify he did not reveal that he had any appreciation of the division in available recovery of the $55,000 for fire damage specified in the policy. 
     
      
    21 The respondent drew attention to the sentences received by the co-offenders. Lyras was dealt with in the Drug Court. The statutory framework for the operation of that Court distinguishes any imposition by it from any useful comparison with an offender dealt with according to the general law. Lyras would also have been entitled to have taken into account the burns injuries which he sustained unintentionally during the commission of the offence. The remarks of the presiding judge on final sentence in the Drug Court focussed essentially upon rehabilitation and the respondent can acquire no advantage by reference to the sentence received by Lyras. 
     
      
    22 Nor is the respondent’s position relevantly comparable to that of Burrell-Jones. He agreed to, and in fact gave evidence at the respondent’s trial. The respondent was the planner and the intended beneficiary of the so-called “insurance job”. Burrell-Jones was, although criminally involved, at the level of hired help. The discrimination in their respective roles reveals a significantly greater culpability borne by the respondent.  
     
      
    23 His Honour found that full time imprisonment would cause extreme hardship to the family of the respondent. He described the situation of the respondent’s severely handicapped 14 year old daughter as the relevant factor giving rise to this finding. By reason of his offending the respondent has previously been unavailable to assist with the care of his daughter. Although he received a non full time custodial sentence being 2 years periodic detention, for robbery in company in 1998 he was later required to serve full time custody for the drug offences which I have already mentioned. It is difficult to perceive how a repeat of a similar situation can be assessed as extreme. 
     
      
    24 The subjective matters upon which the respondent could draw fall far short of justifying the lenience in the sentences assessed in the District Court and the Crown contention that they were manifestly inadequate is made out and this Court should proceed to resentence.  
     
      
    25 Given, as his Honour had himself found, the absence of entitlement to leniency by reason of the respondent’s prior record and giving such weight as is available for mitigation by reason of the subjective factors discussed, I would assess a sentence of 2 years imprisonment for the offence of damaging property by fire. That assessment is less than should have been imposed at first instance but reflects the restraint which is applicable when an offender is resentenced after a successful Crown appeal. On each of the offences of making a false statement, I would assess a term of 12 months imprisonment. It offers some insight into the self centred nature of the respondent’s criminal conduct that, in the circumstances of injuries suffered by Lyras, he nevertheless continued to seek to pursue obtaining the financial benefit intended by the fraud. 
     
      
    26 I am unpersuaded that special circumstances provoke departure from the proportion between non-parole period and total sentence specified in the statute. The continued pursuit of the respondent’s aims which constituted counts 2 and 3 would justify some cumulation of sentence although, in a sense, all three offences were part of the attempted execution of the one plan. I have concluded that it will meet the situation if the sentences on counts 2 and 3 are served concurrently with each other and with the first 12 months of custody being served in respect of count 1. The sentences on counts 2 and 3 will be fully served within the non-parole period set for count 1 and for that reason I set fixed terms in respect of them. 
     
      
    27 After conviction, the respondent was in custody from 19 August to 17 October 2008, that is 59 days. The sentences should commence on 18 October 2008 to take this previous custody into account.  
     
      
    28 I propose the following: 
     
      
       
      1. Crown appeal against sentence allowed. 
       
      2. Sentences imposed in the District Court quashed. 
       
      3. In lieu thereof the respondent sentenced: 
       
       
       On count 1 (dishonestly damage property by fire) – to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 18 months commencing on 18 October 2008 and expiring on 17 April 2010, with a balance term of 6 months commencing on 18 April 2010. 
       
       On each of counts 2 and 3 (false statement with intent to obtain financial advantage) – to imprisonment for a fixed term of 12 months to be served concurrently with each other commencing on 18 October 2008 and expiring on 17 October 2009.  
       
      4. The respondent be ordered released to parole on 17 April 2010. 
       
      
    29 CAMPBELL JA: I agree. 
     
      
    30 HOWIE J: I also agree. 
     
      
    31 CAMPBELL JA: The orders of the Court will be those proposed by Grove J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Hulme DCJ at Port Macquarie District Court. The applicant had pleaded guilty to a single count of aggravated breaking and entering and committing a serious indictable offence. The offence was stealing and the circumstance of aggravation was his knowledge that there was a person inside the house at the time. His Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of two years and nine months commencing on 31 August 2007 and expiring on 30 May 2010 with a balance term of one year.  
     
      
    2 The facts were that at about 8.30pm on Monday 18 June 2007 Mr Graham Thomas aged fifty seven years was at his home in Kempsey. Mr Thomas is wheelchair bound as a result of amputation of one of his legs and he was at the time operating a computer. He heard a knock on the door and opened it to find an aboriginal male who spoke to him somewhat incoherently but Mr Thomas understood him to say “cigarettes, beer”. Mr Thomas told him that he neither drank nor smoked and the caller left. The caller was the applicant.  
     
      
    3 A little while later the complainant heard some noises in the kitchen but he initially saw nothing untoward and eventually retired to bed. Later during the night he noticed that some beer was missing from the refrigerator and his back door was open. He locked the door. On the following day he noticed that a flyscreen had been cut and a window which was normally closed and locked had been opened. Further investigation showed that other items were missing. The total value of missing items was about $200. 
     
      
    4 In the meantime at about 9 pm on the previous night, that is to say about half an hour after the applicant called at the house he was seen by police, who were patrolling the area, to be walking along the railway track. He was stopped and found to be in possession of a number of items which were later able to be identified as property coming from Mr Thomas’ house. At the time, of course, police were unaware as to what had occurred at the house. The applicant gave his name to the constables who noticed that he smelt of alcohol, was slurring his speech and seemed to be agitated. He was permitted to go on his way.  
     
      
    5 A few days later as a result of observations on a computer system one of the constables recognized items that he had seen in the possession of the applicant as those which were reported missing by Mr Thomas as a result of the apparent entry into his home.  
     
      
    6 Police were unable to locate the applicant for a time, however on 31 August 2007 they became aware that he was in custody in Sydney.  
     
      
    7 On 22 November 2007 the applicant entered a plea of guilty to the offence abovementioned before Taree Local Court and he was committed for sentence to the Port Macquarie District Court. 
     
      
    8 As the learned sentencing judge observed, the applicant has a criminal history commencing with charges when he was aged only fourteen years. The variety of offences includes some twelve matters of dishonesty as well as offences of sexual assault, assaulting police, and damaging property. At the time of this offence the applicant was on a bond to be of good behaviour in respect of two offences of assaulting police. The conditions of the recognizance included an acceptance by the applicant of supervision by Probation and Parole officers, accepting the guidance of a psychiatrist or psychologist, taking medication as prescribed and attending for rehabilitation, counselling and educational development in accordance with medical advice.  
     
      
    9 Two grounds of appeal have been presented although they both agitate the same complaint. They are expressed as follows: 
     
      
       
      “ 
      Ground 1 
       
      The learned sentencing judge erred by misdirecting himself as to the correct standard non parole period for the subject offence. 
       
       
      Ground 2 
       
      In consequence of the error asserted in Ground 1 hereof, the learned sentencing judge erred in using a period of seven years rather than five years as a benchmark in arriving at an appropriate sentence.” 
       
      
    10 The transcript of proceedings shows that the Crown Prosecutor had stated to his Honour: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whilst this is a plea of guilty and the Crown concedes that it is at the first available opportunity and he should receive the full benefit for that(,) a standard non-parole period of seven years does apply and although not strictly relevant to the plea of guilty it certainly is a guide post in sentencing him today.” 
        
       
      
    11 His Honour acted on that information and at the outset of his remarks on sentence referred to a prescribed maximum penalty of imprisonment for twenty years and standard non-parole period of seven years. Later, in his remarks he indicated his application of the latter in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whilst not imposing the standard non-parole period I must bear it in mind as a benchmark, just as I do the maximum penalty, as to the appropriate sentence to be imposed.” 
        
       
      
    12 It is correctly conceded that his Honour was misinformed and the standard non-parole period is five years rather than seven years.  
     
      
    13 The Crown submits that despite the erroneous use of the inflated standard non-parole period no lesser sentence is warranted and seeks the dismissal of the appeal.  
     
      
    14 It can scarcely be doubted that the applicant’s judgment on the occasion of the offence must have been seriously affected by his over consumption of intoxicating liquor. His incoherence when he called at the house and the observations by police officers when he was stopped make this obvious. That provides some explanation for the applicant’s offending but it offers little weight to mitigation. His prior record would operate against attracting leniency and it was a serious matter of aggravation that he was on a recognizance to be of good behaviour conditioned as above set out when he offended.  
     
      
    15 Nevertheless, it is plain that his Honour had reference to a benchmark which was higher than that prescribed by statute. Although it cannot be determined that some arithmetical proportion of his assessment is reflected by his use of the inflated incorrect standard non-parole period it should be concluded that, had the lesser correct figure been used for reference, the assessment would have been less to some extent. The applicant has succeeded in demonstrating a material error and there should be some downward adjustment of sentence. 
     
      
    16 There has been tendered for the purpose of resentence a report by a psychologist, Ms Michelle Player. That report is long and detailed, but in particular it sets out some information about the personal background of the applicant which was not before the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    17 In addition to the psychologist there is a statement by the applicant of remorse which also was absent before the sentencing judge. A considerable part of the recommendations in the report by the psychologist refers to her conclusion that it would be desirable for the applicant, when released to parole, to be admitted to a residential rehabilitation programme. It is beyond the power of this Court to enforce such a recommendation but it is a matter that for my part I would have brought to the attention of the Parole Authority when they come to the date upon which the applicant will be released to parole. 
     
      
    18 The question of special circumstances needs to be considered upon resentence. Having regard in particulars to the matters set out in the psychological report and to the prospect of the applicant being granted the benefit of some rehabilitation, I am of the view that the statutory proportion between non-parole period and total sentence should be varied in favour of the applicant. 
     
      
    19 I therefore propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) Application for leave to appeal against sentence granted and appeal allowed. 
       
      (2) Sentence imposed in the District Court quashed. 
       
      (3) In lieu thereof the applicant be sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of two years commencing on 31 August 2007 and expiring on 30 August 2009 together with a balance term of one year commencing on 31 August 2009.  
       
      (4) The applicant be ordered released to parole on 30 August 2009. 
       
      
    20 BLANCH J: I agree. 
     
      
    21 KIRBY J: I also agree. 
     
      
    22 GROVE J: The orders of the court therefore will be as I have proposed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant pleaded guilty to one count of supply a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. The amount of the drug involved was 1.9 kilograms. A large commercial quantity is 1 kilogram. The maximum penalty for the offence is life imprisonment (s 33(3)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act). The applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 10 years imprisonment with an additional term of 4 years. The offence carries a standard non-parole period of 15 years.  
     
      
    2 Although the applicant entered a plea of guilty it was not entered at the first available opportunity. Before entering a plea to the charge on which he was convicted he had offered to plead to a different charge. It was only after the matter had been set down for trial that he entered his plea to the present charge. The sentencing judge provided a reduction in sentence for the utilitarian value of the plea of 10%.  
     
      
    3 The sentencing judge found special circumstances based on “the offender serving a significant sentence (and) his prospects of rehabilitation and reintegration into the community (being) best served by an extended period of supervision.” The standard non-parole period which his Honour imposed is 71% of the total term. 
     
      
    4 The relevant facts were agreed and incorporated into a written document. They are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “On 26 August 2006 police received information Efstathiadis was to attend Crystal Car Wash in Rose Bay to meet a male known as ‘Hellal Ramadan’ who police believed to be a major drug supplier. The police conducted surveillance at the meeting from 2.20 pm and saw that a third male, whom I shall refer to as ‘D’ was also at the meeting. 
        
       
       
        
        Prior to the meeting there had been a number of phone calls between Efstathiadis and D organising to meet in Sydney. As D got closer to the car wash Efstathiadis gave him directions on how to get there over the phone  
        
       
       
        
        At about 2.50 pm Ramadan left the location driving a gold coloured Mercedes Kompressor. A short time later D left the location driving a white Mazda 323 registration number YKK 465 followed by Efstathiadis driving his vehicle, a black WRX registration number 5TRAPT. 
        
       
       
        
        Efstathiadis and D were then followed to the Westfield shopping complex carpark at Bondi Junction where they arrived at 3.25 pm. At about 4.42 pm D and Efstathiadis returned to the white Mazda registration YKK 465 with Efstathiadis carrying shopping bags which he placed in the vehicle. D walked to the 5TRAPT and got into the driver’s seat. About two minutes later Efstathiadis walked to the vehicle 5TRAPT and got into the front passenger seat. A short time later Efstathiadis walked back to the Mazda YKK 465. 
        
       
       
        
        At this time police have lawfully intercepted two further calls between Ramadan and Efstathiadis where they have arranged to meet at another location in the carpark. 
        
       
       
        
        At around the time of the phone calls Ramadan can be seen on CCTV footage walking into Fitness First at Westfield and making a phone call. At the time he is carrying a Rusty brand backpack. CCTV footage captured Efstathiadis and Ramadan meeting in the parking payment office before walking out of the office and being picked up by the Subaru 5TRAPT that was being driven by D. At this time Ramadan was still I possession of the Rusty brand backpack. 
        
       
       
        
        The vehicle then became mobile in the carpark and CCTV footage shows a person believed to be Efstathiadis placing an object into the passenger’s side airbag compartment. The vehicle completed a lap of the carpark before dropping of Efstathiadis and Ramadan. Ramadan returned to his vehicle no longer carrying the backpack. A short time later Efstathiadis drove Mazda YKK 465 out of the carpark followed by D in Subaru 5TRAPT. A Rusty brand backpack was later located in the Mazda YKK 465. 
        
       
       
        
        About 6 pm the Subaru WRX 5 TRAPT was the subject of a vehicle stop on Princes Highway at Waterfall. At this time the Mazda YKK 465 being driven by the offender was travelling immediately in front with both vehicles appearing to be travelling together. The driver of 5TRAPT, D, was spoken to and LEPRA safeguards applied. The police drug dog attended the location and assisted in the search of the vehicle. Police drug dog Emma indicated in the area under the dash in the vicinity of the glove box and also at the driver’s door. 
        
       
       
        
        The vehicle was seized and transported to Wollongong Police Station where a further search was conducted. At Wollongong Police Station a search of the vehicle was conducted and it was recorded on video tape. In the passenger side airbag compartment police located a plastic bag wrapped in a black T-shirt. The plastic bag contained a crystal substance which, on analysis, was determined to be methylamphetamine weighing 1,980 grams. Also located in the vehicle were person papers and a driver’s licence in the name of Ilia Efstathiadis, the owner of the vehicle. 
        
       
       
        
        At 6.30 pm white Mazda 323 registration number YKK 465 was stopped near the intersection of Campbell and Flinders Street, Wollongong. The driver, Efstathiadis was spoken to and placed under arrest for drug supply.” 
        
       
      
    5 The applicant supplied 1,980 grams of methylamphetamine which is nearly twice the minimum amount constituting a large commercial quantity. The purity of the drug was 59.5%. As the sentencing judge found the amount of drug and its purity indicate that a vast quantity of the drug could be supplied to “many, many street users” as a result of this transaction. 
     
      
       
      Subjective matters 
       
      
    6 The applicant was 27 years of age at the time of the offence. The sentencing judge found that the applicant had participated in a supply network with his “eyes wide open”. He had been previously convicted in December 2000 for the on-going supply of a prohibited drug contrary to s 25A(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act when two further matters were taken into account on the Form 1. For that offence he was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of 2 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 4 months. As a consequence the sentencing judge found that the applicant’s prior record did not entitle him to any leniency. 
     
      
    7 The applicant had a happy childhood and completed Year 12 at school. Since leaving school he has completed courses in accounting, business and computer studies. The sentencing judge was satisfied that the applicant has made positive efforts towards his rehabilitation and there are good prospects that he will be rehabilitated upon his release from prison.  
     
      
    8 The sentencing judge received reports from a probation officer and a psychologist. Those reports did not disclose evidence of regret by the applicant for his part in attempting to supply the large quantity of drugs. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of appeal 
       
      
    9 There are three grounds of appeal advanced by the applicant being: 
     
      
       
      1. The sentence is excessive in the circumstances of the case; 
       
      2. The sentence imposed is outside the proper exercise of sentencing discretion available to a sentencing judge; 
       
      3. The sentence offends the principle of proportionality. 
       
      
    10 It is appropriate to deal with these grounds together. The applicant’s submissions were framed generally and raise four matters which require discussion. 
     
      
    11 The applicant did not advance a submission that the discount of 10% for the plea of guilty was an error. However, the written submissions set out in detail the history of the plea and it was submitted that by reason of the plea a lesser sentence could have been imposed. I am not persuaded that this submission can be sustained. 
     
      
    12 This Court has said on many occasions that the appropriate discount for a plea of guilty is a matter within the sentencing judge’s discretion. There is no one correct answer. In the present case the plea was only offered after the matter had been listed on several occasions and a date had been set for trial. Accordingly, the applicant was only entitled to a discount at the lower end of the available range. As the sentencing judge emphasised, the applicant could have been under no illusion that he had committed the offence with which he was charged. If, as appears, probable, he was engaged in a negotiation from which he sought to gain an advantage on sentence his expectation was not realised. However, having taken that course he is not entitled to complain about the extent of the discount which the sentencing judge provided. 
     
      
    13 The offence was committed with the assistance of a co-offender D who was sentenced by the judge who sentenced the applicant. D was charged pursuant to s 27 of the Act with aiding and abetting the supply of a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. That offence also attracts a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. D was interviewed by the police and made statements contrary to the applicant’s interests. He was ultimately sentenced on the basis that his conduct fell towards the lower end of the scale of objective seriousness. A sentence of 2 years, which was suspended, was imposed.  
     
      
    14 Although it would seem that his Honour was not reminded of the decision of this Court which indicates that the standard non-parole period was applicable to the aiding and abetting offence, the applicant submitted to the Court that the fact that the co-offender received a non-custodial sentence made plain the excessive severity of the sentence which he had himself received. In his remarks the sentencing judge did not deal at any length with the position of D when sentencing the applicant although he indicated that it was the applicant who “orchestrated the involvement of co-offender D to drive the Subaru to the Illawarra area, thus separating himself from the drugs while he drove D’s car.”  
     
      
    15 I am satisfied that there was a “real difference” in the position of the applicant and D, particularly in relation to the offence with which each was charged. When sentencing D the judge found that the applicant and D had different roles in the offending. His Honour found that D’s role was unplanned. No arrangement had been made with him to drive the applicant’s vehicle prior to the applicant requesting this in the car park at Bondi Junction knowing that D admired his car and would not pass up the opportunity to drive it. D did not realise that he was being asked to transport drugs until he saw the parcel being placed in the airbag compartment and even then he was not aware of the type or quantity. D did not participate in any actual supply and there was no arrangement for him to receive any payment or reward for driving the applicant’s car. 
     
      
    16 D had a favourable subjective case. Apart from a conviction for malicious damage in 2003 for which he was fined $500 he was a person of good character, a highly respected member of his local community who frequently gave of his time to help others. He was dedicated to his family and his work, was the primary carer of both his parents. He expressed remorse and had discontinued his recreational drug use. His Honour emphasised his assistance to the authorities which he assessed to be “at the upper end of the scale” which in combination with his early plea attracted a global discount of about 60%. 
     
      
    17 The respondent submitted that the sentencing judge was correct to pay little regard to the circumstances of D when sentencing the applicant. In my judgment this submission should be accepted. The role D played in the offence and his subjective circumstances are not comparable to the applicant. 
     
      
    18 The applicant complained that in setting a non-parole period of 10 years his Honour placed the offence “at the very highest order of severity of sentences imposed”. The non-parole period which his Honour imposed was five years below that set for this offence by the Parliament. His Honour found that the applicant’s criminality was “only very slightly below” the mid range of seriousness for an offence of this nature. The applicant did not submit that this finding was an error. His Honour used the standard non-parole period as a guide post as he was required to do (see R v Way (2004) NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 at [122]). 
     
      
    19 The applicant’s submissions are not entirely clear. The written submissions are not entirely clear and it may be that there is confusion between the non-parole period and the total term. A submission was made that the starting point for the overall sentence which, having regard to the discount for the plea, must have been 15 years and 6 months, is greater than the standard non-parole period of 15 years. His Honour actually set a non-parole period of 10 years which is 66% of the standard period. Having regard to his Honour’s finding as to the objective seriousness of the offence, the time of the guilty plea and the lack of positive matters in the applicant’s subjective circumstances, the non-parole period which his Honour imposed was within the available range. 
     
      
    20 The applicant submitted that the sentence was excessive and does not “reflect the principle of proportionality and revealed a miscarriage of sentencing discretion.” In support of this submission the applicant referred to the Judicial Commission statistics for the period February 2003 to June 2008 which include a total of 15 offences contrary to s 25(2) of the Act where the drug involved was methylamphetamine. The applicant referred to six of these cases to support an argument that the sentence imposed on the applicant was beyond the available range. However, four of the decisions to which the applicant refers were not cases to which the standard non-parole period applied, being offences committed prior to 1 February 2003. As this Court pointed out in Way it was to be expected that when courts commenced sentencing with regard to the non-parole period provided by the amendment to the Act sentences would increase.  
     
      
    21 This Court has often remarked on the care with which statistics must be utilised when sentencing. The need for caution is greater when the statistical pool includes sentences imposed before the sentencing regime was changed. 
     
      
    22 The two cases which the applicant identified where a sentence has been imposed after the legislative amendment were Hamieh (2007) NSWCCA 277 and Ly (2008) NSWCCA 262. In Hamieh this Court considered an appeal in relation to sentence and by reason of the applicant’s strong subjective circumstances, lack of maturity, clinical depression and prospects of rehabilitation together with issues of parity with a co-offender and reduced the sentence. Although the offence was committed after the amendment which provided standard non-parole periods, no reference was made in the decision to the standard period. This Court imposed a total term of 7 years and 11 months with a non-parole period of 5 years and 2 months. The decision does not provide assistance in the present case. 
     
      
    23 In Ly the appellant was sentenced to a total term of 12 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 years. The discount for the plea of guilty was 25% and accordingly, the starting point for the sentence was greater than the starting point in the present case. The amount of drugs involved was 1.10 kilograms and Ly was a user/supplier. The sentencing judge found that Ly’s offending was “only very slightly below the mid range. 
     
      
    24 When consideration is given to Ly’s circumstances and the penalty which he received the sentence imposed on the present applicant does not reveal any error. 
     
      
    25 In my judgment leave to appeal should be granted but the appeal dismissed.

    3 R A HULME J: The applicant pleaded guilty in the District Court to a charge that on 8 March 2007 he did attempt to supply a prohibited drug, namely 56 grams of cocaine (the State offence). The offence is contrary to s 25(1) of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 which prescribes a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 15 years and/or a fine of $220,000.4 The applicant appeared before her Honour Judge Morgan on 20 February 2009. He adhered to his plea of guilty and asked her Honour to take into account his guilt in respect of an offence of supplying another prohibited drug, namely cannabis. On that occasion he also adhered to a plea of guilty that had been earlier entered in respect of a charge that between 19 April and 22 May 2007 he had aided and abetted the importation of a border controlled drug, namely cocaine (the Commonwealth offence).5 It is relevant to a procedural aspect that will be discussed later to note that the proceedings before her Honour involved charges on two separate indictments and that the State and Commonwealth Directors of Public Prosecutions were separately represented.6 The Commonwealth offence was the dominant matter in the proceedings. Although the applicant had adhered to his plea of guilty there was a dispute as to the facts upon which her Honour should proceed to sentence in respect of that offence. It was also a significantly more serious offence. The sentence hearing took place over a number of days until ultimately sentence was imposed in respect of both matters on 21 December 2009. Very little time in the proceedings was devoted to the State offence and relatively little was said about it.7 The sentence imposed for the State offence was one of imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 years with effect from 21 May 2007 (the State sentence). For the Commonwealth offence there was a sentence of 5 years 10 months, with a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months, with effect from 21 May 2008 (the Commonwealth sentence). Accordingly, the overall sentence was one of 6 years 10 months and the mandatory period of imprisonment was 4 years 6 months, one year of which was attributable to the State offence.8 The applicant desires leave to appeal but only in respect of the State sentence. It is conceded that the sentence imposed for the Commonwealth offence was an appropriate one.Facts9 There was a statement of agreed facts tendered to her Honour in respect of the State offence. It related that police were conducting an investigation into the activities of one George Agoulian. On the evening of 8 March 2007, Agoulian was contacted by an undercover police officer who indicated that he wanted to purchase cocaine from him. Agoulian then called the applicant and communicated to him the intention of obtaining cocaine from him in order to supply to the undercover officer. During the course of the conversation, the applicant said, “I had to go to Leichhardt … I’m telling you I can’t … actually I will find out for you …”. 10 An hour later the applicant spoke again on the phone to Agoulian and gave him directions to the applicant’s home at Artarmon. Approximately 15 to 20 minutes later, Agoulian was seen walking to another, but nearby, location in Artarmon where he met with the undercover officer and supplied him with 56 grams of cocaine in exchange for $23,800.11 The agreed statement of facts includes a concession by the Crown that “although the offender had intended the transaction eventually conducted by Agoulian, the Crown cannot prove beyond reasonable doubt that the offender did more than attempt to facilitate a supply of cocaine to Agoulian”.12 There were also agreed facts in relation to the offence taken into account. About a fortnight after the primary offence the applicant assisted in financing the purchase by another person of about 10 kilograms of cannabis leaf. He received almost half a kilogram of what was purchased.Subjective circumstances13 The applicant was aged 45 at the time of the offences. He had no previous criminal convictions. Testimonials were tendered which confirmed that he was of otherwise good character. 14 The applicant was born in Lebanon and came to Australia with his family in about 1975. His upbringing was unremarkable. A Pre Sentence Report records that he experienced on-going grief and guilt in relation to a decision he made some 10 years earlier to terminate his father’s life support after he had been seriously injured in a motor vehicle collision. 15 The applicant was married and had three children. The marriage became strained in 2003 and he subsequently entered into a relationship with another woman. His wife did not know of this relationship until after the applicant’s arrest in May 2007. She ceased contact with him and instituted proceedings in the Family Court. 16 The applicant gave evidence before her Honour. It included how he had established a successful panel beating business which at one point had an annual turnover of $4.5 million and 26 staff. The business did a lot of insurance work and it suffered irreparable damage when a major insurance company went into liquidation. The applicant’s business itself went into liquidation in about 2003. Eventually his brother bought the business and employed the applicant as manager. The applicant had also operated a property investment and development business since about 1996. 17 Alcohol and drug use emerged as a significant feature of the applicant’s life in the period leading up to his arrest. He told the author of the Pre Sentence Report that he was drinking up to half a bottle of spirits and smoking a gram of cocaine per day. His consumption of cannabis, something in which he had engaged throughout his adult years, had also increased. He cited stress associated with his extra-marital relationship as the cause. He said that it had also precipitated his offending behaviour. There was evidence from other sources to the effect that there was a notable deterioration in the applicant’s general mood and behaviour in the year or so preceding the offences.18 A report by Dr Stephen Allnutt, forensic psychiatrist, included that the applicant spoke of various matters which were causing him stress in the period leading up to the offences such as the extramarital relationship, paranoia associated with drug use and general difficulties arising from his work. Aside from substance abuse and some symptoms of depression and anxiety, Dr Allnutt did not detect any sign of mental illness or personality disorder.19 The judge recorded that she took into account the absence of previous convictions, prior good character, good prospects of rehabilitation and remorse. I take it that her Honour must have put to one side the evidence that the applicant had been a user of illicit drugs for all of his adult life in making the finding as to his character. Although the plea of guilty in respect of the State offence was entered 10 months after the applicant had been committed for trial, and after he had been arraigned, pleaded not guilty and the matter listed for trial, the judge nonetheless allowed a discount of 20 per cent for its utilitarian value. In R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; 195 A Crim R 1 it was said that a discount of more than 15 per cent would not usually be allowed for a plea entered on arraignment. With respect, it is hard to understand how a reduction of more than 10 per cent was appropriate.20 Her Honour noted a submission that the State sentence should be concurrent with the Commonwealth sentence. In that context she referred to Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 and the principle of totality before stating: 
     
      
       
        
        The State offences are totally separate to the Commonwealth matters and to reflect the criminality I consider it is appropriate that there should be a partial accumulation of the sentences. 
        
       
      
    The application21 There is a sole ground of appeal asserting that the State sentence “was too severe in all the circumstances”. Four reasons are advanced for that proposition: that the fixed term was excessive in the light of the low level of objective criminality involved; the absence of any criminal history and prior good character; a failure to take into account the applicant’s drug addiction at the time of the offence; and that the sentence did not reflect that the applicant had given assistance to authorities.A preliminary matter22 The applicant’s case is, in effect, that there should be no requirement for him to serve any additional period in custody referrable to the State offence. His complaint is twofold. First, that the sentence for the State offence is excessive. Secondly, that the two sentences should be served concurrently (despite what has been said on the subject in cases such as Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41). Alternatively, it was put that the degree of partial accumulation should be less.23 However, the partial accumulation of the sentences was no part of the sentencing order in respect of the State offence. It was a result of the commencement date specified in respect of the Commonwealth sentence. There is no appeal before this Court in relation to the Commonwealth sentence. We have not heard from the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions.24 I take the applicant to be relying upon the provisions of s 59 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which empowers a court when quashing or varying a sentence to vary the date of commencement of any other sentence that has been imposed upon the person by that or any other court. This is in addition to powers of the Court under s 7(1A) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Both of those provisions, however, are only activated upon the quashing or varying of a sentence. If this Court was of the view that it should not interfere with the State sentence, there is no power to vary the commencement date of the Commonwealth sentence.25 The application was first listed for hearing before a differently constituted bench of this Court on 5 November 2010. The matter I have just alluded to was the subject of some discussion. It culminated in Mr Stratton QC successfully persuading the Court to adjourn the proceedings so as to enable an application for leave to appeal in respect of the Commonwealth sentence to be filed. It was accepted that for practical reasons the hearing would have to commence afresh before a differently constituted bench. Despite the reason given in support of the adjournment application, the foreshadowed further application for leave to appeal has not been filed.Merits of the application26 It may be accepted that the applicant’s role in attempting to facilitate a supply of cocaine to Mr Agoulian represented criminality of a low order in the scale of offences against s 25(1) Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act. However, the amount of cocaine involved, 56 grams, was not insignificant, being almost 20 times the prescribed traffickable quantity. Moreover, it was necessary for her Honour to also take into account the applicant’s guilt in respect of an entirely separate and distinct offence which involved him financing the purchase by another person of 10 kilograms of cannabis leaf. That is 33 times the traffickable quantity and 40 per cent of the commercial quantity prescribed in respect of that drug.27 Sentencing statistics were relied upon to support the proposition that the sentence imposed was excessive. They show that 52 per cent of all offenders sentenced for supplying less than the commercial quantity of cocaine from July 2002 to June 2009 received a full-time custodial sentence. In respect of those who did receive such a sentence, 28 per cent received a sentence of 2 years or less. 28 Other matters, however, emerge from the statistics. Where an offence listed on a Form 1 document is taken into account the rate of full-time imprisonment increases to 59 per cent. They also disclose that 91 per cent of all offenders received a term of imprisonment of some form. In the applicant’s case, of course, there was no cause for her Honour to consider ordering that the term be served other than by way of full-time imprisonment. Senior counsel for the applicant, who also appeared in the court below, did not submit to her Honour that some sentence other than full-time imprisonment should be imposed. His submission was that there should be concurrent sentences. In those circumstances, any comparison with statistics should be with sentences of full-time imprisonment that have been imposed.29 The statistics indicate that the vast majority of offenders pleaded guilty but they do not show the extent by which the sentences were reduced on account of that fact. They do not show the quantity of the drug involved (which can be anything above 0 grams up to 250 grams) or the role played by the offender. Where there are additional offences listed on a Form 1 document taken into account, the statistics do not reveal what those offences were. In the present case it was a further drug supply offence which would not be expected to be a common occurrence. For all these reasons I find the statistics to be of little assistance.30 It was submitted that the judge should somehow have taken into account that the applicant was addicted to both cocaine and cannabis. It is not clear from the evidence that the applicant was addicted, but I accept that drug use brought him into contact with others involved in drug supply activity. There was no claim by the applicant that there was any causal connection between his drug use and his involvement in the offences. It was not suggested, for example, that he was supplying in order to feed an addiction and that the objective gravity of the offence was reduced on that account: Regina v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 at [86]. The judge referred to the applicant’s drug use. She referred to the report by Dr Allnutt, noting his recommendation that the applicant should attend a drug and alcohol rehabilitation program. I am not persuaded that there was any failure by her Honour to take the applicant’s drug abuse into account in an appropriate way.31 A submission was made that the judge erred in not taking into account the applicant’s assistance to authorities in respect of the State offence. Her Honour did take this matter into account but only in relation to the Commonwealth offence. She allowed a reduction of 35 per cent for a combination of the applicant’s plea of guilty and his assistance. Given that the Commonwealth sentence was the major consideration in the sentence proceedings I cannot detect error in the judge’s approach. Whether to discount one or both sentences was entirely discretionary: R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220 at 230F and 234D. In any event, the starting point for the State sentence was 2 years 6 months prior to reduction by 20 per cent for the plea of guilty. If it had been reduced as well for assistance, it would have been a sentence of 1 year 7.5 months. Given that only the first year of the State sentence was to be served before the commencement of the Commonwealth sentence, there was no practical utility in her Honour discounting the State sentence for assistance as well. 32 In my view the sentence imposed by her Honour for the State offence was within the range of her sentencing discretion. All matters that were favourable to the applicant were taken into account but, in the end, it was necessary that a sentence be imposed that was consistent with the objective seriousness of the offence and reflected an appropriate degree of general deterrence, an important factor in sentencing for drug supply offences. There was also the need to take into account the additional drug supply offence on the Form 1. No specific error by the judge has been established and I am not persuaded that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357.33 There is a further matter to note. The day after the applicant was sentenced in the District Court he appeared in a Local Court and was sentenced to terms of imprisonment of 12 months for the possession of an unauthorised prohibited firearm and 18 months for the possession of two unauthorised pistols. 34 The Crown tendered to this Court the facts upon which the applicant was sentenced for those matters. They disclose that the applicant’s home was searched when he was arrested on 21 May 2007. Police found a loaded .25 Colt self-loading pistol, a loaded .380 Browning self-loading pistol, and a .22 Stirling single shot bolt action rifle which was not loaded but had a silencer attached. 35 The magistrate ordered that the sentences for these offences commence on 21 May 2007, the same commencement date as the sentence for the State drug supply offence. They would have warranted a separate and discrete custodial imposition but the magistrate had limited jurisdiction to achieve that end. Section 58 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that a Local Court may not impose a sentence partially or wholly accumulative upon an existing sentence if it would extend the length of the total sentence beyond five years. The magistrate could have extended the mandatory period of incarceration of the applicant by six months but exercised his discretion not to do so. Imposing such a sentence would have reduced the potential period for parole considered appropriate by her Honour.36 Accordingly, even if this Court did intervene and reduce the term of the sentence for the State offence, there is, at least in my mind, considerable doubt as to whether it would be appropriate to bring forward the commencement date of the Commonwealth sentence so as to perpetuate the subsuming of sentences for separate and serious firearms offences.OrderI propose that leave to appeal be refused.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Philip Leung is charged with the murder of Mario Guzzetti on Easter Saturday, 7 April 2007. Mr Leung and the deceased were partners, who lived together in a terrace house in Alexandria. 
     
      
    2 Mr Terracini SC, who, with Mr Trevallion, appears for Mr Leung, applies to the Court for a directed verdict of acquittal on the basis that the Crown, having closed its case, has no basis in evidence for the charge, nor for the alternative of manslaughter. His submission is, as it must be to succeed, that there is no evidence upon which a jury, directed in accordance with law, could properly convict.  
     
      
    The Principles on Directed Verdict 
     
      
    3 The principles upon which such a direction may be given are strict and confined, but the test, once satisfied, is not discretionary. It is a trial judge’s duty to direct a verdict of acquittal, if the evidence could not sustain a guilty verdict, or, as more commonly expressed, if there be no evidence upon which a jury, properly directed, could convict: Doney v R [1990] HCA 51; (1990) 171 CLR 207 at 212.6.  
     
      
    4 In determining whether there is no evidence that can sustain a guilty verdict, the court is required to ignore contradictory evidence unfavourable to the Crown case and to take the Crown case at its highest, including any inferences that may arise from the evidence adduced. It is for the jury, not the judge, to resolve conflicting evidence: R v R (1989) 18 NSWLR 74 per Gleeson CJ at 81.  
     
      
    5 While the test has been described as a question of law, it necessarily involves an assessment of the facts that are proved by the evidence adduced. Two issues are clear. First, it is not for the trial judge to determine the issue on the basis that a jury verdict would be unreasonable or, as it was once described, unsafe and unsound (Doney, supra). If there be evidence (even tenuous, inherently weak or vague evidence) which the jury is able to take into account and which, if accepted by the jury, would support a verdict of guilty, the matter must be left to the jury. It is not a matter for the trial judge to pre-empt a potentially unreasonable verdict by a jury, but a matter for the Court of Criminal Appeal, if the verdict ultimately reached be found to be unreasonable.  
     
      
    6 Second, it is insufficient, in determining whether to direct a verdict, for a trial judge to come to the conclusion that a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence can be formulated: JMR (1991) 57 A Crim R 39. If an inference is available from the evidence adduced that is consistent with guilt, it is a matter for the jury, properly instructed, not for the trial judge.  
     
      
    Evidence 
     
      
    7 The Crown case against Mr Leung is circumstantial. The primary facts, leaving aside for the time being cause of death, are, with one exception, uncontroversial and uncontroverted. The one exception relates to an express intention by the deceased to end his relationship with Mr Leung and that he, the deceased, was scared. I will assume, for the current exercise, that Mr Di Francesca’s evidence of Mr Guzzetti’s desire to end the relationship, the desire to sell the house and that the deceased was scared is proved and accepted, notwithstanding some issues as to its probability.  
     
      
    8 Otherwise the facts, taking the Crown case at its highest, are these (not in any order of priority, nor in chronological order): 
     
      
       
      (a) Mr Leung and the deceased were joint owners of their home worth about $600,000; 
       
       
      (b) They lived together since 2004, the property having been purchased from the assets of the deceased; 
       
       
      (c) Each of Mr Leung and the deceased had partners prior to each other; 
       
       
      (d) On Good Friday, 6 April 2007, Mr Leung and the deceased had an argument, the subject matter of which is, according to the Crown, irrelevant, but concerned “a guy doing tiles”, after which Mr Leung stormed off;  
       
       
      (e) At some time on Saturday morning, 7 April 2007, the couple engaged in consensual sexual intercourse; 
       
       
      (f) During the course of the morning, Mr Leung made carrot juice for the deceased and/or himself; 
       
       
      (g) While Mr Leung was making the carrot juice, the deceased “kept at him”, they had a fight; 
       
       
      (h) Between 8.15am and 8.30am on 7 April 2007, there was a sound from the house, heard by the neighbour, like a shelf falling, pots clanging and lids rolling around the floor; 
       
       
      (i) The neighbour then heard the deceased singing (but I will assume, notwithstanding the evidence, a scream), there was then silence (said to be for about 10 minutes) and then the sound of Mr Leung wailing; 
       
       
      (j) At 9.00am a witness rang the home and Mr Leung was hysterical; 
       
       
      (k) When the first persons arrived at the scene, at about 9.15am, Mr Leung was seen wailing or crying hysterically, cradling the deceased’s head, rocking back and forward, his arms extremely tightly bound around the deceased’s neck and head. Mr Leung was in a state of total distress and was, as stated, totally hysterical; 
       
       
      (l) The deceased’s heart had stopped by the time ambulance officers arrived. Resuscitation was unsuccessfully attempted.  
       
      
    9 I return to the timing on Saturday morning, the day Mr Guzzetti died. The neighbour estimates the time of the “shelf crashing” as 8.15am. The time is fixed by her husband’s driving lesson, which commenced at 7.45am and concluded at 8.45am. Her husband arrived home at or about the time that the wailing was first heard. There is an understandable inconsistency between the estimated time of 8.15am, on the one hand, and the estimated 10 minutes of silence and arrival of her husband, on the other. The foregoing is in no way a criticism of the witness, but has implications. Taking the evidence as it best fits the Crown case, there was a gap of 57 minutes (from 8.15am to 9.12am) between the crash and the call to emergency services.  
     
      
    10 There was a smudge of blood on the balustrade of the stairs, between the ground floor and the first landing, blood splatters on the architraves next to the stairs and on the wall adjacent to the stairs and next to the kitchen. There was also a part of the juice extractor on the floor next to the deceased, which juice extractor had DNA from the deceased on it and Mr Leung’s fingerprint from his index finger. The deceased was found at the foot of the stairs, as earlier stated, being cradled by the accused with a pillow under his head. 
     
      
    11 Thereafter, the accused continued to behave hysterically and, at one stage, was required to be restrained, for his own safety, and that of others, and not for reasons of misconduct.  
     
      
    12 The house was, with one exception, in no disarray. Upstairs the beds had not been made, but otherwise the house was clean and tidy. Upstairs was in a state inconsistent with the occurrence of a physical altercation. Downstairs was in a like state, with one exception: the juice extractor component was on the floor adjacent to the stairs and the deceased, and something, the Crown submits the juice extractor component, had hit the wall in the kitchen above the doorway (and below the clock about 2.5 metres high). There were plaster and brick chips on the floor as a consequence. The component, as already stated, had on it the DNA of the deceased, not Mr Leung. The DNA was found on the spout, which the Crown suggests, in the scenario that this was the murder weapon, could be used as a handle. The single fingerprint was not in a position that would allow an inference to be drawn that it was used by Mr Leung as a weapon. Nor was it, of itself, consistent with a component being held by Mr Leung, as distinct from having been pushed or touched.  
     
      
    13 There were relatively fragile pieces of furniture and sculptures in the house, some near the stairs, that were intact and undamaged. Whatever occurred, it occurred on or near the staircase and to some extent in the kitchen (the room next to the staircase toward the rear of the house).  
     
      
    14 Lastly (except for the medical evidence to which I will shortly turn), both Mr Leung and the deceased were dressed in pyjama pants and a top. The deceased had slippers on his feet, being Italian leather slip-on shoes with no back. There was another slipper (of similar kind) in the hall on the other side of the stairwell than where the kitchen was situated (i.e. toward the lounge and dining areas and the front of the house). Presumably this other slipper belonged to Mr Leung.  
     
      
    Medical and Scientific Evidence 
     
      
    15 The medical evidence is at best ambivalent. The Crown called Dr Rodriguez, a neuropathologist, and Dr Botterill, a forensic pathologist, who, at the time, was a Senior Staff Specialist at the Department of Forensic Medicine and who performed the autopsy on the deceased. Further, the accused called Professor Hilton, forensic pathologist, interposed just prior to the close of the Crown case, because he was otherwise unavailable.  
     
      
    16 Dr Rodriguez testified to brain injuries suffered by the deceased, caused by blunt force injury, being a knock to the head either by the application of force to the head by a blunt object or the head hitting a hard object, e.g. a stair or a wall, etc.  
     
      
    17 Dr Rodriguez accepted that the brain injuries, of themselves, would not necessarily cause death and “there is some doubt as to exactly why this person died at the time he did”, but considers there is a direct link to the blunt force injuries [Transcript page 271, lines 10-13]. If, he says, the injuries were to have caused severe diffuse axonal injury (DAI), then the deceased could not have cried out or sung. Further, Dr Rodriguez agrees “that the exact cause and mechanism of Mr Guzzetti’s death cannot be stated beyond reasonable medical doubt”. Dr Rodriguez was unable to say whether the deceased died from brain injuries.  
     
      
    18 The blunt force injuries to the head could, Dr Rodriguez says, be caused by falling down some stairs. Dr Rodriguez deferred to Dr Botterill as to cause of death because he, Dr Rodriguez, was looking only at the brain and no other part of the body, and he may, in some cases, in determining cause of death, by a process of eliminating other causes, arrive at a conclusion that a seemingly minor, otherwise non-fatal injury, was the cause [Transcript page 217, line 15; and page 276, line 40]. 
     
      
    19 I turn then to the evidence of Dr Botterill. He prepared a 13-page report which incorporated Dr Rodriguez’s findings. Dr Botterill concluded that the “direct cause of injury was blunt force head and neck injury”. He could not be certain whether it was a combination of the two or one or the other. “There was blunt force head injury and blunt force neck injury, both of which have the potential to result in death … [but he] … can’t say the relative contribution of both [sic: read each] but … [believed] … that it’s most likely that both together have resulted in the death” [Transcript page 334, lines 22-28]. According to Dr Botterill’s report, the deceased was 71 years of age with no past medical history.  
     
      
    20 Subsequently, Dr Botterill discovered (and the Court accepts) that the deceased had blood pressure problems for which he had been prescribed medication, traces of which were found on analysis. The deceased’s brother, Mr Enzo Guzzetti, who came from Italy to give evidence, also testified that the deceased had osteoporosis in the knees.  
     
      
    21 The injuries included: tears over the skin of the right side of the chin; brazes [sic] and bruises over the skin of the right side of the floor of the mouth; multiple skin tears and bruises over the front of the neck and the upper front of the chest; bruising beneath the skin at the back of both sides of the head; a tear in the lining of the inside of the mouth near the right lower lip; and other findings, including those of Dr Rodriguez, namely, blood over the surface of the brain, and also bruises under the skin of the right arm, left forearm, the right wrist and the knuckles of both hands. There were also bruises to the left back and hip region. The deceased also had excess fluid in the lungs, enlargement of the heart and scarring of the kidneys. He had a 50 percent occlusion of one branch of the coronary artery system.  
     
      
    22 Dr Botterill concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “Although any one of the individual injuries might be associated with a simple fall, the extent of distribution of the injuries is more in keeping with multiple blunt force injuries. It is possible that the neck bruising and chest injuries are related to application of force to the neck but discrete ligature marks or eyeball haemorrhages were not identified.” [Transcript page 336, line 46.] 
        
       
      
    23 An explanation of the foregoing was given by Dr Botterill. A simple fall was explained as a fall in which the head was hit once. A complex fall (i.e. when the head was hit more than once) would include a fall down stairs. Strangulation usually causes burst blood vessels in the eyelids and eyeballs, which were not present. It is possible to have strangulation without them. Likewise, there was no fracture of the hyoid bone (which sits above the langio cartilages). Nor was there damage to the langio cartilages, to which damage occurs even more often in a strangulation.  
     
      
    24 The head injuries are not inconsistent with being hit over the head with a blunt instrument. They are also not inconsistent with being hit on the chin by the juicer component, falling back and hitting the head. The head injuries are also not inconsistent with falling down the stairs.  
     
      
    25 The bruising to the neck is not inconsistent with strangulation. Although, given the absence of petechial haemorrhages (the eyelids and eyeballs) and the absence of damage or fracture to the langio cartilages or the hyoid bone, it is an unusual strangulation, if it be one. It may be consistent with pressure on the carotid artery, at the battery point, causing the heart to slow and/or stop. The bruising to the neck is also not inconsistent with falling down stairs if there were protruding items into or onto which the deceased fell. However, as to the last-mentioned possibility, the injuries are remarkably widespread. Innocent possibilities would also include contact with the metal juice extractor, either at the bottom of the stairs or because the deceased was holding it and came in contact with it on the way down the stairs or at the bottom of the stairs. 26 There are two extracts of Dr Botterill’s examination-in-chief that bear repeating. At Transcript page 351, line 29, speaking of the neck injury, Dr Botterill says: 
     
      
       
        
        “These are in keeping with multiple blunt force contacts but I can’t say with certainty what the exact nature of those contacts were. There are a number of possibilities. It is possible that something such as the application of force from fingertips may result in that bruising. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        It is also possible that other types of blunt force contacts, bumping into various structures, might result in this distribution, although it is remarkably widespread. Blows to that area with some other object may result in these changes. It is also conceivable that some of these changes may be related to attempts at resuscitation … in a very inexpert way … although again that is completely the wrong place to be doing resuscitation. I think they are the range of explanations  
        but the truth is I can’t say which of those particular possibilities is the explanation for those bruises and surface marks 
        ”. (Emphasis added.) 
        
       
      
    27 Further, at Transcript page 353, line 17, the following extract occurs, also in examination-in-chief: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: And the area of bruising around the neck that you can see in photograph 3, is a possible cause of that an attempted strangulation? 
         
        A: Yes, that is a possible explanation. It would be unusual with manual strangulation to have a broad area of bruising such as that just from application of fingers but again it is still conceivable.” 
        
       
      
    There is no evidence, nor is there a suggestion, of strangulation by other than fingers, or, possibly, accidental strangulation by the arms when Mr Leung was cradling the deceased.  
     
      
    28 Cross-examination of Dr Botterill emphasised the uncertainty in the means by which the injury occurred and offered some other innocent possibilities with which the injuries were not inconsistent. 29 Somewhat unusually, Professor Hilton, called by the accused, has already testified. I do not suggest any inappropriateness. Only that the Crown case has concluded (and this application has been advanced) at a time when expert evidence adduced by the accused is before the Court. It seems axiomatic that if, at the time the application for a directed verdict is made, there be evidence from which the jury could infer relevant elements, that evidence must be taken into account on the application. On the other hand, to the extent that Professor Hilton’s evidence is inconsistent with evidence of that kind, it cannot be utilised. In other words, Professor Hilton’s evidence is able to be utilised only to assist the Crown and not to detract from that which otherwise would be its case. I will treat Professor Hilton’s evidence in that way.  
     
      
    30 Professor Hilton reviewed the autopsy report of Dr Botterill (and also Dr Rodriguez). Professor Hilton had a different opinion on the cause of death and on the mechanism for death, or, more accurately, questioned the capacity to come to any conclusion beyond reasonable medical doubt. This material I do not consider in this application.  
     
      
    31 However, other material was adduced, in a most effective cross-examination of Professor Hilton, as to the cause of the injuries to the neck, in particular. Indeed, the evidence of Professor Hilton on the cause of the injury is the best evidence the Crown has in the case. At page 522, the following exchange between the Crown and Professor Hilton occurs. The Crown [referring to nine curvilinear abraded bruises to the chest and/or neck] asks Professor Hilton: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: You agree that’s possibly signs of a struggle? 
         
        A: I think they’re highly suggestive of there being a struggle. [Is it] … exclusive to that, no, but the distribution and number of them, yes, there could. 
         
         
        Q: Before we were talking about manual strangulation and manual strangulation still plays a significant role in this matter; would you agree with that? 
         
        A: Yes. 
         
         
        Q: … manual strangulation requires the hands to go up around the neck area, would you agree with that? 
         
        A: Manual strangulation implies the application of force to the neck by one or two hands, or, perhaps, in fact, … more…. 
         
         
        Q: So those marks on Mr Guzzetti’s chest are consistent, would you agree, with signs of a struggle coincidental with manual strangulation? 
         
        A: Coincidental or associated with, yes.” 
        
       
      
    32 While this evidence seems, at first glance, sufficient of itself to allow the matter to go to the jury, it must be understood in the context of the whole of the evidence. First, “consistent with” is used to mean “not inconsistent with”. Second, Professor Hilton comes to the conclusion, also in cross-examination [Transcript page 528, line 18]: 
     
      
       
        
        “I would think the upper trunk, the chest type injuries and the neck type injuries, would be unusual in a fall down the stairs unless that part of the body hits something that was protruding in the course of the said fall.” 
        
       
      
    The staircase in question had a balustrade (itself described by Professor Hilton as a complex surface) with protruding bollards.  
     
      
    The Drawing of an Inference 
     
      
    33 As already explained, at [6] above, in order to direct an acquittal, it is insufficient to be able merely to formulate a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence. There must be no evidence that could sustain a guilty verdict.  
     
      
    34 The Crown relies on what it describes as inferences available from the medical and scientific evidence (already discussed) (namely, the injuries, DNA and blood splattering), the timeline (in particular the alleged 57 minute gap), the tension in the relationship, the lack of any other person with opportunity, the noises heard by the neighbour (and the silence thereafter), together with the financial gain that, it is said, may be motive for the crime. Essentially, the Crown relies upon the facts, set out at [7] and following above, to allow the drawing of an inference that, from all the possibilities for the means by which these injuries have been caused, the jury should (or may) draw the inference that the deceased was strangled and/or hit over the head (either with the juice extractor component or otherwise) by Mr Leung. It is unclear in which order this is said to have occurred.  
     
      
    35 The drawing of an inference is a matter of commonsense. The High Court discussed this issue in Morgan v Babcock & Wilcox Ltd [1929] HCA 25; (1929) 43 CLR 163. Morgan was a criminal prosecution for receipt of secret commissions/bribery. The Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The question involved largely depends upon the degree to which coincidence of events and circumstances warrants a belief in their causal connection. An examination of hypotheses logically consistent with proved facts is the received method of testing their sufficiency to establish the conclusion. In the end, however, the reasonableness or the probability of the occurrence of such hypotheses determines their admissibility, and when coincidence of fact and concurrence of time are relied upon, the sufficiency of the circumstances must inevitably be judged by considering whether general human experience would be contradicted, if the proved facts were unaccompanied by the fact sought to be proved.” (Per Knox CJ and Dixon J at 173.4.) 
        
       
      
    This passage was cited with approval by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Fabre v Arenales (1992) 27 NSWLR 437 at 445.  
     
      
    Conclusion 
     
      
    36 I take account of all of the facts and circumstances suggested by the Crown. I also take account of the fact that the deceased had been moved or attended to by the accused at a very early stage. The pillow under the deceased’s head, I assume, came from an upstairs bedroom, which may account for the smudge of blood on the balustrade. The accused may also have put the deceased’s slippers on the deceased’s feet. It would be unusual, if the deceased fell down the stairs, for his slippers to have remained on his feet. But that is also true if he had been knocked out or over, or strangled.  
     
      
    37 I am not entitled to consider, in terms of the relationship between the two, that they were sleeping in different bedrooms. There is no evidence to suggest this to be unusual. Nor does it seem that the fact that the front door was open and (contrary, on one view, to their practice) the security door unlocked, facts that would otherwise suggest someone had gone outside, are relied upon by anyone. Nor is the DNA of an unidentified male under the fingernails of the deceased seemingly relevant.  
     
      
    38 Ultimately, the Crown case on cause of death and the means by which it was achieved relies upon the proposition that, “general human experience would be contradicted, if the proved facts were unaccompanied by the fact sought to be proved”, namely, the deceased being hit with the juice extractor, falling back and hitting his head causing the head injuries and some attempt at strangulation, before or after this occurrence, causing the neck injuries.  
     
      
    39 In the context of a murder trial, the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt: that an act of the accused caused death; that the act was deliberate; and that the accused had an intention to kill, an intention to cause grievous bodily harm or a reckless indifference to human life.  
     
      
    40 In this case, the mechanism, being, in this context, the act that caused the injuries causing death, has to be speculative and, as a consequence, renders a finding of a deliberate act by the accused more speculative. A fortiori, it renders the necessary state of mind for murder, most speculative, and not a matter on which the jury is entitled to draw an inference. The jury is not entitled to conjecture or fill the gaps that, without any criticism of the Crown or the police, necessarily arise in this matter.  
     
      
    41 Further, given the availability on a charge of murder to the alternative of manslaughter, it is necessary to deal with that aspect. Much of the previous analysis, and all of the facts, are relevant in this regard.  
     
      
    42 The relevant difference between murder and manslaughter is, in this case, the state of mind of the perpetrator. In manslaughter it is unnecessary to show an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. However, it is necessary, relevantly, for the Crown to show an unlawful and dangerous act. Since the act causing death is not proved beyond a reasonable doubt, it is mere conjecture to suggest that the accused committed an unlawful and dangerous act, i.e. an act that a reasonable person would understand had an appreciable risk of serious injury: Wilson v R [1992] HCA 31; (1992) 174 CLR 313 at 333. 
     
      
    43 In the circumstances, I propose to direct the jury to return a verdict of not guilty to murder and, also, not guilty to manslaughter.

     Dinh Them NGUYEN v REGINA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: The initial question for determination is whether the applicant should be granted an extension of time to appeal against his conviction. In July and August 2005 he stood trial with a co-accused Cuu Nguyen and they were both found guilty by a jury of cultivating a large commercial quantity of the prohibited plant cannabis following which the presiding judge, Finnane DCJ, imposed sentences of imprisonment on each of them. 
     
      
    2 An application for leave to appeal against sentence by the applicant was successful and on 25 August 2006 this Court substituted a reduced sentence to that imposed at first instance. An appeal against conviction was not then pursued. However Cuu Nguyen appealed against his conviction and on 14 February 2008 the appeal was allowed, his conviction quashed and a new trial on the count charging cultivation was ordered: 2008 181 A Crim R 72. The sole ground of appeal relied upon by Cuu Nguyen was that “the learned trial judge caused the trial to miscarry when he refused to allow duress to be put to the jury”.  
     
      
    3 The applicant now seeks to advance an identical ground challenging his conviction. 
     
      
    4 While the Court has appropriate power to deal with issues of sentence and conviction separately and in that sequence, the remarks of Mason P in O’Connor v R [2007] NSWCCA 266 are applicable and they bear repetition, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        “An appellant should understand that (without an order based on extraordinary circumstances clearly proved) neither a Notice of Intention to Appeal nor a Notice of Appeal will be permitted to be filed out of time after a sentencing appeal has been heard and determined; and that any application for an extension of time to allow this to take place will be closely scrutinised. Unless the application is demonstrably meritorious it is likely to be refused, especially if the sentence matter has already been dealt with without any prior indication from the appellant of his or her intention to challenge the conviction itself. It should not be assumed that any and every breach of the time limits in the Rules will be excused.” 
        
       
      
    5 Affidavits by the applicant and by Ms Fisher and Mr Blair who were solicitors having practical conduct of the matters on behalf of the applicant during their respective employments by the firm acting for the applicant have been read. It is revealed that, after conviction, the applicant pursued the challenge to sentence and not against conviction in an apparent belief that his limited funds would not extend to making a challenge against conviction. Up to that point he was not in receipt of legal aid and funded his own representation.  
     
      
    6 The explanation is less than cogent, however the proviso expressed by Mason P in O’Connor concerning circumstances where an appeal might be demonstrably meritorious operates in the applicant’s favour. 
     
      
    7 In the particular circumstances of this case, the issue can be dealt with relatively briefly. 
     
      
    8 The ruling by Finnane DCJ was similar in relation to both the applicant and Cuu Nguyen. His Honour recorded that a jury note had been received in these terms:  
     
      
       
        
        “Is the argument that the accused were under duress still an issue for consideration?” 
        
       
      
    9 His Honour observed that, up until then, duress had not been raised in the presence of the jury, nevertheless evidence had been given both by the applicant and his co-offender which might readily be understood by the jury as such. However his Honour ruled that the evidence given by the applicant manifested threats about what would happen to him if he left the location and he concluded that those threats were not causally connected with the charge. 
     
      
    10 It is well established that the issue of duress is not raised unless there is evidence capable of supporting a reasonable possibility of the existence of each of its elements, in which event the onus is on the Crown to exclude it: see Cuu Nguyen at par 29. The applicant gave evidence. Inter alia, he testified that he was recruited to do farming work and did not realise that the crop was to be marijuana. It was a co-worker (this large criminal enterprise had a number of farmhands engaged) who told him after he had been there for some weeks that the plant was illegal. He testified that he “tried to run away” but was dissuaded by threats which on at least one occasion were articulated as his being shot and buried by the bobcat, which was an implement on the property. He said that he did not flee because he feared that so doing would risk his life. 
     
      
    11 Such evidence is of course for evaluation by a jury but the issue should be left to them if it is capable of being believed and thereby supporting a reasonable possibility of the existence of the elements pertaining to the issue of duress. 
     
      
    12 In response to the jury his Honour directed the jury that both of the applicant and Cuu Nguyen participated in the cultivation voluntarily and there was no issue of duress to be considered. 
     
      
    13 In this Court the Crown submissions recognized that the assertions of the applicant were “common to those made by Cuu Nguyen” save that the applicant did not use the expression of the co-accused that he was “forced to do the illegal”. The absence of identical words being uttered by the applicant does not create a relevant gap in the supporting evidence and it is plain from the summary of matters adverted to above that it would be reasonably open to a jury to conclude that the applicant’s participation in the cultivation which constituted the crime was a consequence of relevant duress. 
     
      
    14 The essence of the situations of the applicant and Cuu Nguyen are indistinguishable and therefore merit is demonstrated within the meaning of the expression as used by Mason P in O’Connor above quoted. 
     
      
    15 There is no basis for different outcomes being reached in the appeals of the applicant and Cuu Nguyen. 
     
      
    16 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) Time of lodging an appeal against conviction extended as necessary. 
       
      (2) Appeal allowed. 
       
      (3) Conviction quashed. 
       
      (4) New trial ordered. 
       
      
    17 BLANCH J: I agree. 
     
      
    18 KIRBY J: I agree. 
     
      
    19 GROVE J: The orders of the Court will therefore be as I have proposed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Knight DCJ on 11 December 2007 at Penrith District Court. The applicant had pleaded guilty to a charge of robbery in company, for which there is a prescribed maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    2 An agreed statement of facts was placed before the Court. These have been summarized in the Crown’s written submissions and I can draw the following from there. 
     
      
    3 After an evening of socializing at the Rooty Hill RSL Club a number of persons including the applicant and co-offenders and the victim Mr El-Nakib left the club in a courtesy bus at about 3 am. During the journey there was an altercation between some of the passengers and the driver stopped the bus. Police attended and ultimately the passengers were required to make their own way home. Mr El-Nakib was walking away when he was accosted by the applicant and his co-offenders. The group, of which the applicant was a member approached Mr El-Nakib hurling insults such as “fucking wog”, “fucking arab cunt” and “go back to your own fucking arab country”. Mr El-Nakib became concerned for his safety and a co-offender approached him and pushed him to the ground. Whilst he was there he was kicked about the head and body a number of times by the applicant and another co-offender. Further insults were being shouted. During this assault Mr El-Nakib was robbed of his wallet which contained $450, his mobile phone and his house keys.  
     
      
    4 The applicant and his co-offenders ran off and the victim was able to flag down a passing police car, who took him for treatment. He suffered a dislocated right shoulder, a severely swollen right eye socket, right eye haemorrhage and numerous bruises and grazes.  
     
      
    5 The applicant was aged twenty at the time of the offence. His father had died suddenly when he was eleven years of age and his mother gave evidence that his behaviour had deteriorated after his father’s death. A pre-sentence report noted that the applicant had difficulties adjusting after his father’s death and he became involved with an older negative peer group. He left school after Year 9 but had not been able to engage in any really meaningful employment. 
     
      
    6 His Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months commencing on 8 November 2008 and expiring on 7 May 2011 with a balance term of 18 months. The total term was therefore 4 years. Counsel for the applicant expressly accepted that the term was not manifestly excessive. His Honour had made a number of findings concerning aggravating circumstances and none of these have been the focus of challenge.  
     
      
    7 The grounds of appeal were expressed: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in failing to consider the principle of totality in sentencing the applicant. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 2: The sentencing judge erred in failing to give effect to the finding of special circumstances in the context of earlier sentences imposed on the applicant.” 
        
       
      
    8 These grounds can conveniently be dealt with together. To perceive the essence of the applicant’s complaints it is necessary to examine his other offences. Coincidentally he had on two previous occasions been sentenced by Knight DCJ and it is easy to empathize with the exasperation which his Honour revealed in his final remarks to the applicant, which were obviously designed to encourage the applicant to, as his Honour succinctly put, “get a grip on your life”.  
     
      
    9 The offence which is the subject of this appeal was committed on 3 September 2005. At that date he was on bail in respect of offences of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm and aggravated breaking and entering and committing an indictable offence. The first of these offences had been committed on 18 October 2003 and the second on 3 March 2004. On 10 November 2005 he was sentenced on these matters, respectively, to a fixed term of imprisonment for 18 months commencing on 10 November 2005 and expiring on 9 May 2007 and to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 12 months commencing on 9 May 2007 and expiring on 8 May 2008 with a balance term of 2 years and 6 months.  
     
      
    10 Committed prior to all of these was an offence of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon on 7 January 2003, however, he was not charged with this offence until 8 September 2006 following investigation which included DNA profiling. 
     
      
    11 On 16 July 2007 for this offence committed in 2003 he was sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 1 year commencing on 9 November 2007 and expiring on 8 November 2008 with a balance term of 2 years and 6 months.  
     
      
    12 As can be seen, his Honour fixed the commencement date of the present sentence at the expiry of the non-parole period for the lastmentioned offence. 
     
      
    13 The consequence in terms of totality was that the applicant will be in custody for a minimum term stretching from 10 November 2005 to 7 May 2011, a total of (in round terms) 5 years 6 months. His balance term during which he may be eligible for parole is 1 year 6 months. In proportion, that minimum custody represents just under 79 percent of a notional total term of 7 years.  
     
      
    14 With obvious reference to the statutory prescription his Honour said, in his remarks on sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        “The balance of the total term of imprisonment exceeds one-third of the non-parole period because there are special circumstances which are: 
        
       
       
        
        (1) your need for a lengthy period of supervised parole in order to assist in your rehabilitation, and 
        
       
       
        
        (2) your age.” 
        
       
      
    15 Examined in isolation the sentence for the index offence, divided into a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months and a balance term of 18 months, shows that the non-parole period is a proportion of 62.5 percent of the total term. 
     
      
    16 It was submitted by the applicant that (as was the fact) the omission by his Honour to refer to the total effective outcome of proportion between minimum custody and balance term was surprising. It was contended that the omission amounted to error.  
     
      
    17 In R v Ibrahim [2005] NSWCCA 43 Buddin J observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “Although in its current form s 44 (2) does not prohibit a court from setting a period for the balance of the term which is less than one-third of the non-parole period, it is rather surprising, in the circumstances of the present case, that the sentencing judge did not indicate his reasons for having arrived at such a result. I am inclined to the view that the sentencing judge simply overlooked the matter.” 
        
       
      
    18 In Ibrahim the effective period of minimum custody was 90 percent of total term. Buddin J also referred to a number of other similar matters where the percentage varied but minimum custody exceeded 75 percent of total term and it is not necessary for present purposes to recapitulate them. 
     
      
    19 I am satisfied that the grounds of complaint by the applicant have been made out.  
     
      
    20 I would maintain the finding of special circumstances for the reasons given by his Honour and endorse those findings favourable to the applicant which he made. I would substitute a sentence in which the proportion used by his Honour in the index sentence is approximately applied to a notion of total term. 
     
      
    21 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) Leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
       
      (2) Appeal against sentence allowed. 
       
      (3) Sentence imposed in the District Court quashed and in lieu thereof the applicant sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 1 year 6 months commencing on 8 November 2008 and expiring on 7 May 2010 with a balance term of 2 years 6 months. 
       
      (4) The earliest date of eligibility for parole is specified as 7 May 2010. 
       
      
    22 BUDDIN J: I agree. 
     
      
    23 PRICE J: I agree. 
     
      
    24 GROVE J: The orders will be as I have proposed.

     Judgment 
    1 GROVE J: At the commencement of the hearing of this appeal, without objection by the Crown, counsel for the applicant sought to add a second ground which stated that the sentencing proceedings miscarried due to an absence of procedural fairness. Senior Counsel for the Crown candidly acknowledged that there was some substance in this ground. 
     
      
    2 It suffices for present purposes to make brief reference to the procedural problem with occurred in the court below. His Honour was provided with a scheduled statement of facts as well as the indictment. Subsequent investigation has revealed that the facts upon which his Honour sentenced the applicant were not necessarily assigned to the appropriate counts of the indictment. The indictment itself contained a large number of counts and asserted crimes of a sexual nature upon two victims over a considerable period of time. 
     
      
    3 Understandably, the learned sentencing judge assessed sentences for each of the counts in the indictment and made certain orders for cumulation from time to time. As I have indicated, it appears now to be common ground that, at least in some instances, his Honour was imposing a sentence upon a count in the indictment upon the basis of facts which were not put before him to support that particular count. One can also observe, simply in passing, that there may be another problem in respect of some matters where it appears fixed terms were imposed for offences where standard non-parole periods had been prescribed and there is a statutory inhibition on that. 
     
      
    4 Given all those circumstances, it appears inevitable that the matter must be properly considered as the applicant is entitled to procedural regularity in dealing with these matters. 
     
      
    5 The Crown has indicated that it may well be in the outcome that the same or a similar total result will emerge and it is not appropriate to comment upon that at this stage, beyond saying that this court is giving no indication one way or the other in relation to that. 
     
      
    6 However, having regard to what I have said, it is inevitable that ground two must be upheld. I propose that the application for leave to appeal against sentence be granted, the appeal allowed, the sentences imposed in the District Court quashed and the matter be remitted to the District Court for re-sentence 
     
      
    7 SIMPSON J: I agree 
     
      
    8 RA HULME J: I also agree 
     
      
    9 GROVE J: The orders of the court therefore will be as I have proposed.

     Hin Sang WOON v Regina 
     
     
     JUDGMENT  
    1 SIMPSON J: I agree.2 BLANCH J: This is an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed in the District Court on 5 March, 2010. The applicant entered pleas of guilty to two counts of wound with intent to cause grievous bodily harm contrary to s33(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900, which carries a maximum penalty of 25 years and has a standard non-parole period of seven years. He was originally charged with two counts of wound with intent to murder but the alternative counts under s33(1)(a) were accepted by the Crown in full discharge of the indictment. He was sentenced on the first count to a non-parole period of five years to commence on 28 August, 2008 with an additional term of three years. On the second count he was sentenced to a non-parole period of five years to commence on 28 August, 2010 with an additional term of three years. The total sentence was one of ten years with a non-parole period of seven years.The facts3 At about 7.40 a.m. on 28 August, 2008 the applicant went to the home of the victims with a gift of food for the victims, he was admitted to the house. The female victim, who was aged 71, took the food into the kitchen and the applicant followed her. She had her back to the applicant who stabbed her in the left shoulder, then the back and then the head. He continued to stab her with what was subsequently found to be half of a large pair of kitchen scissors. She was able to run out of the kitchen and out the door screaming for help.4 The female victim’s husband, who was 80 years old and who was a wheelchair bound invalid, was in the bathroom on the lavatory. He heard his wife screaming and shouted out to her. The applicant ran into the bathroom and began stabbing him. He tried to defend himself and kick out at the applicant. Neighbours came to their rescue and the applicant left the house and threw the weapon into a rubbish bin. He then went to the bank, withdrew a large sum of money and bought a ticket to Hong Kong. He was arrested in Hong Kong and subsequently extradited to Australia.5 Both victims were taken to hospital. The female victim suffered ten stab wounds, two to the head, five to the back of the head, two between the neck and shoulder and one to the abdomen. It was estimated she had lost between one and one and a half litres of blood. She also suffered a fractured finger during the attack. Doctors considered two of the wounds to be life threatening. One of the wounds was a five centimetre long wound to the head which required stitches. Another was a wound to the shoulder which penetrated at least nine to ten centimetres into the left shoulder blade and entered the lung and, as a consequence, she suffered a haemopneumothorax. The wound to her right upper chest was 2.5 centimetres deep. She spent eight days in hospital.6 The male victim had three stab wounds to the left shoulder, all of which were less than one centimetre deep, three to the right scalp considered to be superficial, a wound to the left upper arm, another to the back of the right hand and a laceration on the left wrist. The chest wound was at a position between the second and third intercostal space and was considered to be potentially life threatening. This wound penetrated between five and nine centimetres in depth and caused his lung to collapse. He remained in hospital until 13 October, 2008.7 The applicant at the time was 74. The female victim and the applicant had known each other through their mutual association with the Hainan speaking Chinese community. The claim made by the applicant was that he had been the subject of rumours spread by the victim that he was having an affair with another Chinese woman. The applicant told Police that in 2003 or 2004 he was at Flemington Markets with his friend, Mrs Wang, when they met the female victim. He said the victim said “Is this your lover?” or “Is this your wife?” The victim denied that she had said any such thing. The sentencing judge was sceptical of the account given by the applicant, noting in particular that in the record of interview he said at first he stabbed the female victim because she lifted a wok and he thought she was going to hit him. Subsequently he agreed he stabbed her when she had her back to him and he did so when he was angry. He was questioned about this in the sentence proceedings and the judge noted he prevaricated.Grounds of Appeal8 The applicant has filed a notice of application for leave to appeal based on 20 grounds. These grounds involve a microscopic examination of every finding the sentencing judge made. Counsel for the applicant was invited to distil these grounds into something more appropriate for the hearing of an appeal against the severity of sentence and 11 grounds are now put forward for consideration.9 The first ground argues not enough weight was given to remorse and contrition. It is true there were statements of remorse and contrition from the time the applicant was first arrested, but the sentencing judge correctly noted that in expressing remorse the applicant was still justifying his actions by reason of provocation. It should be noted that whatever else may be said about the asserted provocation, it cannot possibly apply to the attack on the male victim in his wheelchair who was doing nothing other than shouting out to support his wife. The judge did note these expressions of contrition and the question of how much weight should be given to his expressions of remorse is one to be determined when deciding the ultimate issue in this case, namely whether any less severe penalty is warranted in law and should have been passed in accordance with s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.10 The second ground of appeal argued asserts that no weight was given to the expert opinion of Dr Lucas who said the applicant had become depressed in 2008 following a motor vehicle accident and it was highly probable this depression aggravated his concerns and influenced “… both his decision to confront her and the loss of control when he did”. The sentencing judge did deal in some detail with Dr Lucas’s report but found that Dr Lucas gave no support for his finding other than “… the assertions of the offender”. The sentencing judge said:  
     
      
      “If the offender was depressed during 2008 and remained so, it is a matter that may have a role to play in mitigation of sentence but I am unpersuaded that there was some process operating on the offender’s mind at the time of the offence which reduces the objective gravity of his crimes.”  
      
    The submission made is that because of the mental condition of the applicant, general and specific deterrence played a lesser role and it was a circumstance to be taken into account in assessing the objective factors: see, for example, R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228. Again this is a question which should be assessed when dealing with the ultimate question under s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act.11 The third ground of appeal asserts insufficient weight was given to the applicant’s age or health and the hardship that a long term of imprisonment would impose. The sentencing judge did refer to these issues and the question raised in this ground of appeal again is a question to be evaluated in determining whether a less severe sentence is warranted in law. The sentencing judge did note that his age was relevant because he would spend a significant part of his remaining years in prison. She declined to find that his ill health would make a term of imprisonment unduly harsh. It is true that all of those factors need to be considered when arriving at an appropriate sentence but again that is a matter to be considered when applying the test under s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act.12 The fourth ground of appeal is that the sentence for the second offence should not have been made cumulative on the first sentence. In my view that ground of appeal has no merit at all. The second attack was on an invalid who was 80 years of age and in respect of whom there had never been any suggestion he had provoked the applicant. In my view a failure to impose a cumulative sentence would have been an error. The assessment of the degree of the accumulation of the sentence is one for consideration at the end of the day in determining if a less severe total sentence is warranted.13 The fifth ground of appeal argued is that the sentencing judge did not properly assess special circumstances in setting the non-parole period. The sentencing judge found special circumstances because it was the applicant’s first time in prison and that he would need support on his release. It is argued there were other factors which would give rise to a finding of special circumstances but the argument at the end of the day is what reduction there should be in the non-parole period for a head sentence of ten years. The statutory ratio would give rise to a non-parole period of seven years and six months. The effect of the sentence in this case was a non-parole period of seven years. Again that is a factor which needs to be considered when making an assessment under s6(3) of whether or not a less severe sentence is warranted bearing in mind the offences under consideration.14 The sixth ground argues that insufficient weight was given to the applicant’s prior good character, his good prospects of rehabilitation and the fact that he is unlikely to re-offend. The sentencing judge did note his lack of prior convictions and that the offences were out of character. It is somewhat academic to be considering prospects of rehabilitation and the likelihood of re-offending in circumstances where the applicant was 74 at the time of the offence and would be over 80 at the time of his release. No sentence could have been contemplated which would have seen him released significantly before he turned 80 and in this case I do not see a failure to refer to his prospects of rehabilitation is of any significance in the sentencing process.15 The seventh ground of appeal is that the sentencing judge gave no weight to the severe emotional stress of the applicant. The sentencing judge was in a good position to make an assessment of the extent of any emotional stress on the applicant because of the suggested provocative statements. She rejected the applicant’s version of the degree of provocation and stress claimed. She gave reasons for doing so. In my view those reasons were justified and the most that could be said is that the applicant may have had a belief about what the female victim had said and that might explain why he committed the offence. As the sentencing judge observed, other witnesses did not speak of his depression and anxiety at any significant time prior to the offences and the accounts of his anxiety and depression come from him and from what he told Dr Lucas.16 The eighth ground of appeal argues that her Honour erred in finding beyond reasonable doubt that the female victim had not made provocative statements. The sentencing judge did that for the reasons I have given and it was a conclusion open to her on the basis of finding that the applicant was an unreliable witness even though the applicant’s friend Mrs Wang said that four or five years before August, 2008 when she was with the applicant at Flemington Markets the female victim said to the applicant “Is that your lover?”17 Provocation is no defence to the charges in this case but provocative conduct may be relevant on the question of sentence. Nevertheless it should be borne in mind that provocation is only available as a defence to murder if the conduct of the deceased was such as could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self-control as to have formed an intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm – see s23(2)(b) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).18 The ninth ground of appeal is that the sentencing judge erred in finding that the applicant was an unreliable witness and therefore could not be accepted. For the reasons given, I believe this conclusion was open to the judge and indeed was a correct assessment. 19 The tenth ground argues that her Honour erred in finding beyond reasonable doubt the applicant took part of a pair of scissors to the property and the offences were planned. As I have observed, the sentencing judge was understandably cautious in accepting evidence given by the applicant. This was in particular because he gave a false account of what occurred when first spoken to by the police and also because when that false account was put to him in cross-examination, he did not want to answer the question. The victims both said that the weapon did not come from their premises and the judge was entitled to find on that basis that the applicant had brought the weapon to the premises. That fact does not suggest any great degree of pre-planning and I do not believe the dispute has any real impact on what is the appropriate sentence. It is submitted that evidence of what the applicant intended to do otherwise on the day the offences occurred would indicate no pre-planning and perhaps they indicate no great degree of pre-planning but it was open to the judge to find that the applicant went to the premises with the weapon with the intention of using it. That is particularly so when he took a gift of food to the house of the victims and began his attack when the female victim was dealing with that food.20 The last ground of appeal relied upon is that the sentence is manifestly excessive. That ground requires this Court to consider whether the sentence is obviously too great and that a lesser sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed. The major thrust of the argument advanced on behalf of the applicant is that he had become consumed with anxiety because of the suggestion made by the female victim a number of years before, perhaps in 2003 or 2004, suggesting that Mrs Wang was his lover. According to the applicant, that suggestion was raised again by the female victim some months before the offence. The argument is that the stress caused by these matters overcame him and caused him to commit the offences. Even if that evidence were accepted at its highest, I find it difficult to see that the sentences imposed in this case are excessive. Certainly the offences are out of character but the attack on the female victim was prolonged and vicious. The attack on the male victim was without any explanation on an 80 year old man confined in a wheelchair. The stabbing of that victim was also serious. These are offences that carry a standard non-parole period of seven years and maximum sentences of 25 years. The sentencing judge correctly determined it was justified not to impose the standard non-parole period on each charge. However, as I have indicated had the sentencing judge not imposed a cumulative sentence for the second offence, she would have fallen into error. In my view the sentences that have been imposed are very moderate sentences. Indeed longer sentences would have been justified. 21 Even allowing for the fact the applicant was showing greater signs of distress immediately before the offences and that he believed he and his friend were being maligned by the victim, I do not believe any lesser sentences could possibly be warranted and accordingly, I would refuse the application for leave to appeal.22 GARLING J: I also agree.23 SIMPSON J: The order of the Court will be as proposed by Justice Blanch.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HOWIE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentence that arises in somewhat unusual circumstances. The parties agree that for the purposes of determining the application a single Judge should constitute the Court. 
     
      
    2 The applicant was originally charged with dangerous driving causing death contrary to s 52(A)1(c) of the Crimes Act. The offence was alleged to have been committed at Kellyville on 7 September 2005. He pleaded not guilty and the matter was dealt with by a judge alone trial conducted by Judge Morgan. The allegation was that the applicant was driving dangerously at about 3.10 pm in a public street on a weekday when he lost control of his vehicle or in some other way he allowed his vehicle to come in contact with the deceased. He was at the time performing duties as a traffic controller and standing alongside a cement truck. He was pinned by the applicant’s vehicle against the truck and died of his injuries The Crown alleged that the applicant was engaged in some type of manoeuvring of the motor vehicle that resulted in him striking the hapless deceased.  
     
      
    3 The applicant gave evidence before her Honour to the effect that for some reason he had a momentary blackout, the result of which was that he was not in control of his vehicle at the time that it struck the deceased. Her Honour came to the view that she was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the factual circumstances relied upon by the Crown were made out and, therefore, she could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the applicant was driving dangerously. Rather, she came to the view that the evidence was, in her words, ""more suggestive of momentary inattention"" which in the circumstances of this particular case her Honour did not believe amounted to dangerous driving for the purposes of the charge for which the applicant was being tried.  
     
      
    4 The result was that her Honour found that the applicant was not guilty of the s 52A offence. As a consequence she was asked to deal with, what was in effect, a back-up charge under s 166(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 of negligent driving occasioning death. That is an offence contrary to s 42(1)(a) of the Road Transport (Safety and Management) Act. It is a summary offence for which the maximum penalty in the applicant's case was imprisonment for 18 months. 
     
      
    5 Her Honour imposed a community service order of two hundred hours. The sentencing remarks of her Honour amount to no more than the imposition of the sentence. They do not attempt to explain why her Honour imposed the sentence that she did. However, she did make it known that she was sentencing the applicant on the basis of momentary inattention. This paucity of the sentencing remarks is perhaps understandable because, generally speaking, the pronouncement of the sentence would have been the end of the matter. However, the history thereafter shows why a Judge should give properly reasoned sentencing remarks even when dealing with a matter under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act. 
     
      
    6 The applicant ultimately failed to complete his community service order. In fact he served only 11 hours. The reason for that is probably both a lack of commitment by him and some medical problems, one of which, in the view of the community service officer, would have disentitled him to such an order had he disclosed the injury at the time he was being assessed. There was also an injury that the applicant suffered during the period while the community service order was on foot. The result was that, after much to-ing and fro-ing over a lengthy period of time, the order was ultimately revoked.  
     
      
    7 The matter was re-listed before the District Court and, for reasons that are presently irrelevant, the applicant failed to appear on the hearing date. A bench warrant was issued and the applicant appeared before the Parramatta District Court on 24 February 2009 in custody. The judge hearing the proceedings was not Judge Morgan. There followed a hearing of sorts that, it has to be said, were completely unsatisfactory as a way of determining to take away a citizen’s liberty. I think it is important to set out what happened in some little detail because the present proceeding is an application for leave to appeal against what purports to be the exercise of a sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    8 It is important to understand that the applicant was aged 28 years when he came before the District Court as a result of the breach of the community service order. In effect he had no criminal record and a very minor traffic record. The offence occurred over four years earlier. He had given evidence before Judge Morgan that he had been working as a courier driver at the time. He expressed remorse for the killing of the deceased to the family that was in the court and related how the death had affected him. 
     
      
    9 The proceedings for the breach was governed by s 115 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999. The relevant part of the provisions for present purposes is s 115(3) which is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (3) If satisfied that the applicant has established the grounds on which the application is made, the court may revoke the offender’s community service order and (if it considers it appropriate to do so) deal with the offender in any manner in which it could have dealt with the offender had the order not been made. 
         
        
       
       
      It is clear from the terms of this provision that, where a community service order is revoked, the court deals with the offender for the offence in respect of which the order had been made. There is no offence of failing to carry out a community service order. 
       
      
    10 The judge before whom the applicant came was to determine whether the application for the revocation had been established, whether in the court’s discretion the order should be revoked and, if so, to deal with the offender “in any manner in which it could have dealt with the offender had the order not been made”. 
     
      
    11 Unfortunately this is now how the Judge dealt with the matter. The parties had in mind that the matter would be adjourned for an updated report and the solicitor appearing for the applicant asked for bail. However his Honour read aloud from the application for the revocation of the order, including the recommendation that the order be revoked and some other penalty substituted. When the defence suggested that his Honour might need more facts, the Judge stated, “There are enough facts there for me”. He made it plain that in his view the only alternative was full-time imprisonment and “it’s a question of how long”. The Judge then asked the Crown’s representative, “What’s 190 hours equivalent of, Mr Crown?” The Crown indicated he could not do the calculation. The Judge stated, “Don’t they say that 50 hours per month or something is the rule of thumb?” The Crown said he did not know. The Judge then proceeded to indicate that he would convert the remaining periodic detention to full-time custody and, having some notion of “50 hours as a rule of thumb for a month” imposed a fixed term sentence of three months. 
     
      
    12 With respect, his Honour simply failed to approach his task, as he should have done, because he did not understand that in effect he was re-sentencing the applicant for the offence for which Judge Morgan had sentenced him. He merely determined to apply some understanding that he had that fifty hours of community service equalled one month in custody. He imposed the sentence without any appreciation of the facts of the offence for which the community service order had been imposed or any concern as to the subjective factors relating to the applicant. He understood his only function was to convert unperformed hours of community service into a period of full-time custody by applying some mathematical formula even though the parties before him were unaware that such a formula existed. I should add that neither of the very experienced counsel before me had ever heard of any such formula. 
     
      
    13 As a result a sentence of imprisonment for three months was imposed upon a person of good character with a minor traffic record for an offence of negligent driving causing death where the negligence was momentary inattention. The only justification for the imposition of the prison sentence was that the applicant had failed to perform the community service order imposed upon him by Judge Morgan. 
     
      
    14 I have set out what happened in this case in order to put to rest any suggestion that there is a presumption that a failure to perform community service order results in a prison term and that there is any mathematical formula to be applied to convert unserved periods of community service into a period of imprisonment. The proper course is to re-exercise the sentencing discretion in respect of the offence committed but taking into account that community service is no longer available. It may follow that there is, therefore, no alternative to the imposition of a prison sentence but that is to be determined on the material then available to the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    15 The applicant therefore went into custody. He appealed to this Court and he was granted bail. He served one month and two days in custody before being granted bail and being released.  
     
      
    16 The matter now comes before me on appeal. There is really no dispute between the parties as to the manner in which I should deal with the application. The judge’s discretion having seriously miscarried, I am to re-sentence the applicant. There is some dispute, however, as to what I should do now. With great respect to Judge Morgan it is difficult to understand precisely what facts her Honour found that gave rise to the driving negligently that was not driving in a manner dangerous to the public. It is difficult at times to discern the difference between the two offences because driving in a manner dangerous is merely an aggravated form of negligence. But it is an important distinction, not only because of the relevant penalties that apply, but also because one cannot sentence a person for negligent driving on the basis of conduct which would amount to driving in a manner dangerous.  
     
      
    17 I am left in some difficulty in re-sentencing the applicant because I do not understand what her Honour found as a matter of fact in sentencing the applicant to community service for two hundred hours other than it was a case of momentary inattention. What caused that momentary inattention is left un-stated and undetermined. The applicant had suggested that he had suffered a blackout for some reason not explained or that he may have fallen asleep. Again it is difficult to know what to make of those assertions and certainly her Honour did not indicate the circumstances in which the momentary inattention arose. Of course I have no help whatsoever from the Judge who determined that the applicant should spend three months in custody.  
     
      
    18 I have been given a number of statistical tables and, as so often is the case, what they reveal is that the maximum penalty imposed by the statute has little or no impact upon the sentences being imposed. Every time this Court is asked to consider statistics on any offence, other than perhaps murder, the statistics reveal a markedly lenient approach to sentencing, having regard to the maximum penalty imposed. In any event I am not here to redress the question of ranges or appropriate penalties. It is not my function to determine that the range is too low and, therefore, take that into account in sentencing the applicant. 
     
      
    19 However, the statistics reveal that very minor sentences have been imposed upon offenders who have actually caused the death of another human being, albeit by negligent driving. I have difficulty in understanding how s 10A or s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 can be used for such an offence. It seems to me, that these statistics reveal that little regard or insufficient regard is being paid in the Local Court or the District Court on appeal to the fact that the offender being sentenced has caused the loss of life. In any event I have to sentence this applicant and I have to do so within an apparent range even if I think the range is manifestly inadequate to reflect the seriousness of the offence. 
     
      
    20 There are limited sentencing options that I have available to me. I can send the applicant back to do another one and a half months or so in custody. He was granted bail and it is fairly trite law, at least in this Court, that the grant of bail should not interfere with the Court imposing an appropriate sentence. However, having regard to the range of penalties that have been imposed on offenders for this offence, I do not intend to send him back into custody. This is not to say that had Judge Morgan sentenced him to three months imprisonment I would have interfered with that sentence but I must re-exercise the discretion afresh. I bear in mind that now the applicant has spent a short period in custody, and it seems on the statistics before me that is a fairly exceptional sentence for somebody charged with this offence.  
     
      
    21 I have been provided with a judgment of the Chief Magistrate. With respect it is an admirable judgment looking at the issues and concerns in sentencing for this type of offence. His Honour in that matter, which I should indicate was a significantly more serious act of driving than this, thought that the appropriate sentence to impose was one of 12 months imprisonment less a discount for a plea of guilty of 25 percent. But then, for reasons completely personal to the offender in that case, decided to suspend the sentence. His Honour rightly stresses the significance of general deterrence and the importance of denouncing the fact that the offender by his negligent driving caused the death of a completely innocent person. In the present case the deceased was simply engaged in carrying out his employment on a Sydney street in the middle of the day.  
     
      
    22 I cannot now impose community service on the applicant. That was a very lenient sentence. I could suspend a sentence but because of what I consider to be the completely inappropriate provisions in relation to suspended sentences for this State, I could only suspend the sentence for one and a half months on condition that the applicant is of good behaviour for one and a half months. The absurdity of such a sentence should be obvious  
     
      
    23 Because the applicant has done some part of his community service order and has served one month in gaol, the only appropriate course is to place him on a bond to be of good behaviour. The applicant should understand that in my view this as a very lenient sentence and it is not the sentence that I would have imposed had I been sentencing instead of Judge Morgan. He has had in one way a piece of good luck, in another way a piece of bad luck: his bad luck in ending up in gaol for a month has resulted in his good luck in now receiving a very lenient sentence.  
     
      
    24 Nothing that I say in this matter and the penalty that I impose should be taken in any way by either a Magistrate in the Local Court or a Judge in the District Court to indicate that a good behaviour bond is an appropriate penalty for this offence in these circumstances. I have made my view clear, for what it is worth, that the range of penalties being imposed, at least in the Local Court, is inadequate and fails to reflect the fact that offenders charged with this offence have taken a human life. The applicant has served his disqualification period, however he cannot have his licence returned to him until the RTA is satisfied that he is able to drive safely for himself and other members of the community. That is a matter for the RTA and medical evidence placed before them.  
     
      
    25 The period of my bond shall be 12 months and it will be a condition of that bond that he is of good behaviour and includes his conduct in relation to his use of a motor vehicle, driving matters when he does and if he does get his licence back. If he does get his licence back then for the period of the bond that is remaining a breach of the Motor Traffic Regulations will be a breach of this bond. Of course if he is in any way not of good behaviour, although I don't believe he will be, he will also be called-up before me. I am not imposing any requirement that he attend the Probation and Parole Service. The probation officers do not think that is necessary. He has work. He has a stable relationship and he is hoping to marry a young lady. 
     
      
    26 Everything else about him appears to indicate that he is a worth while member of the community who on this particular day made a very serious error, whatever that error was, that allowed him to bring his motor vehicle into contact with another human being and causing that man's death. If that does not dissuade him from being very careful in the future about his conduct behind the wheel of a motor vehicle, I don't suppose anything I can do to him will. But if he breaches my bond seriously by a motor vehicle offence, I will consider returning him to gaol. It is not a threat, it is just an indication that I feel at the end of the day he has been let off very lightly.

     JUDGMENT  
    1 THE COURT: On 23 March, 2009 the appellant entered pleas of not guilty to an indictment charging four counts of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s61M(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum penalty of ten years and a standard non-parole period of eight years and two counts of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of ten contrary to s66A of the Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum penalty of 25 years and a standard non-parole period of 15 years. The first two offences of indecent assault were said to have occurred at Albion Park between 1 January, 2006 and 30 April, 2006. The third and fourth charges of indecent assault were said to have occurred between 1 April, 2006 and 30 September, 2006. The two counts of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of ten were also said to have occurred between 1 April, 2006 and 30 September, 2006.2 The appellant was convicted in respect of all charges and sentenced on count 1 to a fixed term of 18 months to date from 31 March, 2009, on count 2 to a fixed term of two years to date from 31 March, 2009, on counts 3 and 4 to fixed terms of two years imprisonment to date from 31 March, 2010, on counts 5 and 6 on each count to a non-parole period of seven years to date from 31 March, 2010 with an additional term of four years. The total sentence therefore was 12 years with a non-parole period of eight years from 31 March, 2009. He appeals against the conviction and seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed.The facts3 The appellant commenced a relationship with the complainant’s mother in 2003. The mother had separated from her husband and had custody of five children. The complainant was the third child born on 1 January, 1997.4 The first count involved a complaint that one night at their home in Albion Park the complainant’s mother was in bed and the complainant was sitting on a lounge when the appellant sat next to her. She said the appellant touched her on the breasts and the vagina and described a rubbing motion for ten minutes. The complainant agreed she was unsure of when the offence was committed and she made no complaint.5 The complainant said the second offence occurred at their house at Albion Park again when her mother had gone to get pizza. She said she was asleep when the appellant came in and lay down next to her and did the same thing as before, touching her all over, including on the breasts and vagina. She thought this incident occurred about two or three weeks after the first occasion. She agreed no complaint was made by her.6 The complainant said the third occasion was when they were at the appellant’s mother’s house at Kiama. She said she was watching a movie on television sitting on a lounge and the appellant came up to her and started touching her including rubbing her breasts and thighs. He then took her into his bed where he did the same thing. She believed this offence occurred a short time after the second offence. She said while she was on the lounge the appellant was squeezing her breasts and when she told him to stop he put his hand down her pants and squeezed her vagina.7 The fourth count related to the appellant putting the complainant into his bed and on that occasion touching her breasts and vagina again at Kiama.8 The fifth count related again to the incident on the bed referred to in the fourth count. The complainant failed to provide this information to police on the first occasion but subsequently did so. She gave evidence that the appellant put his fingers into her vagina. She thought this incident lasted for ten minutes.9 The sixth count related to the same episode on the bed. The complainant gave evidence that after the incident referred to in count 5 the appellant went to the end of the bed, pulled down her pants and started licking her vagina on the inside.10 The complainant gave evidence that after the various incidents at the appellant’s mother’s house forming the charges three to six, she sent a message on her phone to her mother asking could she please come and pick her up because the appellant was touching her in places “… that I don’t want to be touched.” She said he then drove her home but that on the way he stopped and parked and said to her that he was sorry and started crying. The evidence of the complainant and her mother was that the mother asked the appellant then to stay the night because he was talking of committing suicide.11 The complainant’s mother also gave evidence about the complaint by way of text message. She was sitting having a drink with her next door neighbour KL and she showed KL the text message. He also gave evidence of seeing the text message complaining of a sexual assault by the appellant.12 After the complainant arrived home with the appellant either that night or the next day the mother asked the complainant what happened and she said he had touched her private parts. The mother then spoke to the appellant and asked him if it was true and he said it was. He was crying and upset and talking about committing suicide. She said at that stage she wanted to give him another chance and the complainant agreed with her not to go to the police.13 Late on the night that the mother received the complainant’s text message, the mother decided she needed some time off work so she drove with the appellant to her manager’s house at Dapto. Her manager was able to specify the night was 10 December, 2006 because the next two days were the days the mother took off work. The mother agreed in cross-examination that she had told police she didn’t tell her manager what the allegation was and that was because she knew her manager was a mandatory reporter in respect of allegations of child abuse.14 At some stage shortly after this, the appellant returned to live at his mother’s house but by Christmas 2006 he had returned to live with the mother and they resumed their de facto relationship.15 At a subsequent time there was a family function for Mother’s Day hosted by the appellant’s stepsister CW and at that function the mother spoke about these complainants to a member of the family (KM). Later the mother told the appellant that the stepsister CW wanted them to go down and talk about it and the appellant agreed to go to CW’s house.16 At CW’s house there was a discussion between the complainant’s mother, the appellant’s stepsister CW and the appellant. CW gave evidence that the mother had telephoned her to say she was worried that the appellant might commit suicide and could they come around. She said that she and the mother did most of the talking and that the appellant was quite upset and crying quite a bit. CW said she was saying to the appellant you need help and he responded by nodding his head or shaking his head and at different times said “Yes I know”. She was not able to give specific evidence that this related to any particular allegation.17 Some time after that visit to CW’s house, the mother told CW that the whole thing had been a misunderstanding. She said she did this because she wanted to resume the relationship with the appellant. In about March, 2007 the appellant moved back to his mother’s house and in May, 2007 the mother moved away with her children. The appellant continued to visit at weekends and sometimes staying overnight until the relationship came to an end in November, 2007. In April, 2008 the mother reported the allegations to a social worker who put her in touch with the police. The complainant was first interviewed on 22 April, 2008.Grounds of Appeal18 The first ground of appeal is that “the trial judge failed to properly put the defence case. It has long been the law that an accused is entitled to have his case presented to the jury – see Pemble v The Queen (1971) 124 CLR 107 at pp.117,118. However, in Domican v The Queen (1992) 173 CLR 555 the Court said: 
     
      
      “Nevertheless, the requirement of fairness means that ordinarily the respective cases for the prosecution and the accused must be accurately and fairly put to the jury. But that requirement does not oblige the judge to put to the jury every argument put forward by counsel for the accused.” 
      
     
     
      
      “Whether the trial judge is bound to refer to an evidentiary matter or argument ultimately depends upon whether a reference to that matter or argument is necessary to ensure that the jurors have sufficient knowledge and understanding of the evidence to discharge their duty to determine the case according to the evidence.” 
      
    In this case the defence case consisted of denials in the record of interview and denials in the evidence of the appellant at the trial that he had not committed the offences. He also raised his own good character. Otherwise his case was an alternative reason for the complainant texting her mother and wanting to go home on the night she was staying at his mother’s (because she was sick), and a criticism of the prosecution case because of lack of specificity. He also raised a question of credibility of the complainant because she had kept in touch well after the relationship between the appellant and her mother ceased. He raised the question of the mother’s credibility because there was a dispute that arose in early April, 2008 over a property the appellant and the mother had purchased together and a telescope valued at $10,000 in the possession of the appellant. The appellant indicated he would not return the telescope and there was discussion about the property dispute. About one week later the mother approached the social worker concerning the allegations for the first time. The defence case also consisted of an attack on the credibility of the complainant because she made a statement about the matter to the police which did not include any allegation relating to the last two more serious offences. It also included an attack on the credibility of the mother who agreed she had told CW the whole story was a mistake after the initial conversation and she had not told the truth about what she had told her manager.19 Here the judge in the summing up did refer to the denials by the appellant in the record of interview which was an exhibit. He also referred to the evidence of the appellant about texting her mother because she was sick – see pp31, 32 of the summing up. The judge also referred to the criticism of the lack of precision in the evidence of the complainant and read out part of the cross-examination relating to it – see p23 of the summing up. The judge also referred to the evidence of the appellant’s mother that on the night of the texting and going home the complainant said she was going home because she was sick – see p31 of the summing up. He did not refer to other aspects of the defence case.20 The central issue in this case was the allegation made by the complainant and denied by the appellant but it was not simply a case of word against word. There were two important pieces of evidence supporting the Crown case. The first of these was the text message of complaint sent by the complainant, received by the mother and seen by an independent witness at the time of its reception. The second was the evidence relating to the meeting between the appellant, the mother and CW when the appellant was crying.21 In dealing with the text message the trial judge went through the evidence and postulated that the defence case suggested the mother received a text message saying the complainant was sick but then told the witness L that it was a complaint about a sexual assault. The judge then said: 
     
      
      “You might find that that is a little difficult to accept members of the jury.” 
      
    He went on to point out that the witness L actually read the text.22 There is no prohibition against judges expressing a view about the facts of a case if it is made clear to a jury that they are the only judges of the facts. It would be prudent for judges not to express a view about significant and contentious facts if that might be seen as abandoning a position of impartiality and entering the arena. In this case the comment of the judge coming as it did at the end of the summing up might well have been seen in that light.23 The second important piece of evidence supporting the Crown case was the evidence of the meeting with CW. In his judgment on the admissibility of this evidence, the judge made it clear he was admitting it as an admission. In his address to the jury the prosecutor said it was an admission. However, the evidence as given did not indicate any admission to any particular act. The evidence was of a general discussion of the appellant’s need for treatment and of him nodding his head or shaking it and crying. This might be argued to be an admission but it might also have been interpreted by the jury as a consciousness of guilt. The second ground of appeal argued here is that a direction should have been given in accordance with Edwards v R (1993) 178 CLR 193. Such a direction would have been advisable.24 At the end of the day the question is whether the summing up was balanced enough to afford a fair trial. Section 161(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1912 states that a judge need not summarise the evidence in a trial if it is not necessary. In this case the judge did choose to summarise the evidence in the Crown case fully. So far as the defence case was concerned, he referred only to aspects of it. On the important aspect of the text message he referred to the appellant’s account but to disparage it. On another important aspect of the meeting with CW, no direction was given to assist the jury. As to another important aspect of the defence case, namely the credibility of the complainant and the mother, there was no reference in the summing up.25 In Reg. v Veverka (1978) 1 NSWLR 478 this Court held that an accused is entitled to have his case presented to the jury in the summing up so as to enable the jury, from the terms of the summing up itself, to comprehend and understand what the defence case is – see per Street CJ at p482. This summing up fell short of that test and the appellant was not afforded a fair trial.26 Accordingly, the order of the Court is that leave to appeal out of time is granted, the appeal is allowed and the conviction is quashed and a new trial is ordered. It is therefore unnecessary to deal with the application for leave to appeal against sentence.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: We have reached a decision in this matter and the decision is that your appeal will be dismissed. I will ask Justice Howie to deliver the judgment. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: The applicant was sentenced in the District Court on 7 November 2008 in respect of two offences of child sexual assault. The first was an indecent assault committed between 1974 and 1975 against a child, who shall be referred to as AR. The second offence was an act of indecency committed between 1979 and 1980 against a child under the age of 16 who shall be referred to as KB. The first offence was contrary to s 76 of the Crimes Act (NSW) 1900 (now repealed) and carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 6 years. The second offence was contrary to s76A of that Act (now repealed) and carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 2 years. In respect of the first offence the Judge was asked to take into account two offences on a Form 1 both being indecency offences committed against AR between 1974 and 1975. 
     
      
    3 In respect of the first offence, and taking into account the matters on the Form 1, the applicant was sentenced to 12 months with a non-parole period of 6 months to date from 7 November 2008. The non-parole period expired on 6 May 2009. In respect of the second offence the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of 2 months to date from 7 May 2009. As a result of these sentences the applicant had to serve a total minimum period before being released to parole of 8 months with a parole period of 4 months. The minimum period of custody expired on 6 July 2009 when the fixed term expired. The applicant was on that date entitled to be released to parole. 
     
      
    4 The applicant has now been paroled but on condition that he reside in NSW. However, the applicant wishes to return to Victoria because that is the State where he normally resides with his wife. The applicant can be permitted to serve his parole period in Victoria by having his parole transferred under the Parole Orders (Transfer) Act 1983. However, the Commissioner of the Corrective Services Commission has issued an instruction, purportedly under s 235B of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act, that includes the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        No registrable Offender/Parolee included under the Child Protection Act 2000 will be eligible for interstate transfer. 
        
       
      
    5 It is the view of the Department of Corrective Services that the applicant comes within that prohibition and therefore cannot have his parole transferred to Victoria. 
     
      
    6 This Court has no jurisdiction to determine whether this instruction is within the power conferred upon the Commissioner or whether the applicant does fall within the prohibition for interstate transfer of his parole order set out in this instruction. 
     
      
    7 As a result of this situation the applicant has sought leave to appeal to this Court against the sentence imposed. His grounds of appeal set out on his Notice of application for leave to appeal are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. Extracts of and from transcripts of hearing (a) copy of Application for transfer of parole to Victoria. 
         
         
        2. Medical condition and need to have ability to have a new knee inserted in right leg which is presently bone on bone. Also to see my own specialists re continuity of Medication, Heart, Diabetes specialists. 
        
       
      
    8 On a document headed “Submissions” the applicant has written: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1, the application of a parole order of 4 months from 7th July 2009 be removed as it manifestly impinges (sic) by extra cost incurred to move to a premises in N.S.W. for four months. 
         
         
        Medical condition is currently under control whilst in custody in NSW will place undue stress in finding (1) a new cardiologist (2) a new diabetes specialist and I was booked for a new right knee in Nov 2008 in a private hospital with another specialist. 
        
       
      
    9 Attached to this document is a letter signed by the applicant to the Court. It is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Having unsuccessfully applied to the parole board of NSW to have my parole transferred to Victoria for the 4 month period as above, I request consideration as to the removal of the parole provision as it is my wish to return to my home of 40 years in Croydon Victoria 3136. 
         
         
        I have fulfilled all the requirements of me whilst incarcerated and having to serve my parole period in NSW will add to my financial pain of supporting not only a home in Victoria, but I will be forced to spend money on accommodation which in the present climate is a difficult task. I am a self funded retiree and the breakdown of the World economy has not done me or my Allocated pension any favours. 
         
         
        I enclose my submission to the parole board of NSW which to my understanding (as I was not presented with a copy of the ruling) was based on a ruling which became legislation in 2005. 
         
         
        I was and am prepared to enter into parole in Victoria or if your Honour were to determine some other form of compliance. Before being arraigned here I had been on parole in Victoria and had complied with all directions of the parole board. My Victorian parole manager had also to make a presentence report which was submitted at my hearing. 
         
         
        It is my sincere wish to be reunited with my wife of 43 years upon my release which will also place an extra stress on her and since being at Junee Correctional Centre she has already travelled from Melbourne on at least 6 occasions and we have other dates which she will be attending me here. Finding alternate accommodation will also necessitate a bond of no less than $500 that is assuming I can rent for such a period of 4 months. 
         
         
        I originally lodged an appeal against severity of sentence, but Legal Aid suggested that there would be little hope of achieving a favourable result, I am asking for the Mercy of the court to be invoked in this case and to have the parole clause removed from my sentence. 
         
         
        I attach copies of submissions from my hearing which I consider relevant and trust you may also look upon them favourably when considering my request. Judge Boulton was a circuit judge from Queensland in the week of my proceedings. I've highlighted those parts of the submissions to Judge Boulton which I consider relevant to my request. 
         
         
        My medical conditions as listed, still exist and I would that I could return to the situation of my private consultants to continue the support which existed prior to my incarceration and which has been continued to a degree in here. Obviously I have been unable to have a new knee inserted and that pleasure awaits my returned to Melbourne. I am currently a self-supporting Superannuant with private health insurance. 
        
       
      
    10 The applicant has annexed to this letter an application he made for the transfer of his parole and parts of the transcript before the sentencing judge highlighting submissions made on his behalf and parts of the evidence of a psychologist called on his behalf. The applicant highlighted these portions to support a submission made to the sentencing judge that the applicant was rehabilitated. 
     
      
    11 Some question must arise as to the admissibility of much of this material because it is relevant, if at all, only to an event that occurred subsequent to the imposition of sentence. The Court will not normally receive this material unless, because of an error in the sentence imposed, this Court is required to resentence the applicant. 
     
      
    12 In light of the ground upon which the applicant seeks to have this Court intervene it is unnecessary to recount the facts or subjective circumstances of the applicant in any great detail. The offences were part of a course of conduct by the applicant arising from a sexual relationship he had with a 12 year old girl in Victoria. The present offences occurred when the applicant was holidaying in NSW with the two complainants. The offences especially involving the child AS were serious involving as they did acts of penetration of the child or by the child upon the applicant. He had been convicted of similar offences against AS in Victoria and served a prison sentence before being dealt with by Judge Boulton. 
     
      
    13 The applicant does not contend that the sentences were manifestly excessive or that there was any patent error in the reasons for sentence given by the Judge. He simply asks this Court to exercise mercy and delete the parole period. In effect he is asking the Court to reduce the sentence because of an event that has occurred since the sentence was imposed, that is that he has been refused to have his parole transferred to Victoria. 
     
      
    14 In R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 Hunt and Badgery-Parker JJ stated at 257: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Where circumstances arise for the first time after sentencing which are alleged to render the sentence imposed either excessive or inadequate, the review of that sentence is the proper province of the executive government and not of this Court: R v Munday [1981] 2 NSWLR 177 at 178. 
        
       
      
    15 The refusal to transfer his parole is an administrative decision. This Court does not take into account administrative acts in determining the sentence to be imposed. Nor does it supervise the manner in which sentences are served as a result of administrative decisions made by the Corrective Services Commission such as the segregation of a prisoner or the transfer of the applicant from one prison to another. In R v Vachalec [1981] NSWLR 351 at 353–354 Street CJ stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        … as an Appeal Court, it is not its function, nor is it equipped, to fulfil a continuing supervisory role over the effect of imprisonment upon an individual. Such a matter involves essentially administrative considerations and remedial action involves essentially an exercise of administrative power that this Court does not possess. This Court exercises judicial power; it has no power or authority to give administrative directions regarding the treatment of prisoners. Nor has it power or authority by administrative order to change the character or concomitants of sentences or to bring about total or qualified release of persons in custody. That power and authority resides in the hands of the Executive Government. Administrative miscarriage in the working out of a sentence cannot be remedied by this Court as it has no jurisdiction to enter the administrative field. 
        
       
      
    16 This Court does have an extraordinary jurisdiction to intervene where subsequent events have revealed a latent problem, usually of a mental or physical nature in the accused person, that was unknown or not fully appreciated at the time of sentence but where, if it had been known or appreciated, some different sentence would have been imposed. The jurisdiction was exercised in R v Ehrenburg (NSWCCA, unreported, 14 December 1990) where immediately after being sentenced the applicant had given birth prematurely to a deformed child. The sentencing court was aware of complications in her pregnancy but not the full extent of the problem. 
     
      
    17 In R v Ashton [2002] NSWCCA 498; 137 A Crim R 73, this Court was asked to exercise the jurisdiction in relation to a case where unbeknown to the sentencing judge the applicant had a psychiatric aversion to imprisonment because of a previous event the result of which was that he fled the jurisdiction rather than serve a term of periodic detention. In the course of allowing the appeal, I stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [11] However, this Court must be careful to maintain a principled approach in dealing with appeals before it. The Court should be scrupulous to ensure that there is a proper basis for receiving evidence of events that occurred after sentence where there is no error established in the sentence imposed. In Ehrenberg, the Court emphasised the special and unusual circumstances that would permit such evidence to be received and acted upon in order to reduce an otherwise appropriate sentence. Loveday J, with whom Gleeson CJ agreed, stated: 
         
         
          
          It must be stressed, however, this is a most unusual case. It will be unfortunate if the special facts and circumstances of this case, which I regard as borderline, were to be regarded as a general precedent for the review of a sentence by this court in the light of subsequent events. Such a course is, as it has always been, a matter for the executive government (see R v Munday (1981) 2 NSWLR 177). 
          
         
         
        Samuels JA, while also agreeing with Justice Loveday, cautioned against this Court erring in principle as a result of sympathy for the applicant. 
        
       
      
    18 The jurisdiction has been exercised where the sentencing judge’s expectations as to the manner in which the sentence would be served was frustrated by subsequent events that indicated that the true position was not appreciated at the time of sentence. So in R v Keir [2004] NSWCCA 106 an appeal was allowed where the judge understood that special arrangements could be made for the imprisonment of an elderly prisoner with severe heart disease. However, the applicant’s medical condition deteriorated and the Court felt it necessary to intervene although the was no error in the sentence imposed. However, the Court stressed that the jurisdiction to receive evidence of post-sentencing facts and to alter the sentence imposed as a result of those facts should be “rare and exceptional”. 
     
      
    19 There is some superficial similarity in the present case. The sentencing judge and presumably those appearing for the applicant were unaware that the applicant would not be permitted to serve parole in Victoria. The Judge found that he was rehabilitated. There was thus no practical purpose for the applicant to be on parole for the purpose of supervision or assistance. I would find it difficult to accept that the Judge did not believe that the applicant would be released to return to Victoria after serving the non-parole period in this State. Part of the submission of counsel for the applicant in requesting a suspended sentence was that there was no purpose for the applicant to serve a prison sentence away from his family and his treating doctors in another State. 
     
      
    20 I cannot but feel sympathy for the applicant who no doubt served his sentence in the belief that once he was released to parole he would return to Victoria. He must be feeling frustrated that he is the victim of “red-tape”. This is the result of a prohibition of general application that does not consider the individual facts and circumstances of a particular case. These were old offences and there is not the slightest suggestion that the applicant presently presents a danger to any child either in this State or anywhere else. Yet he has been caught by the width of the legislation concerned with the registration of child sexual offenders and hence falls within the general prohibition that, for no apparent public policy that I can identify, deprives him from returning to his family and his support system in an adjacent State. 
     
      
    21 However, I do not believe this case falls into the rare and exceptional circumstances that would justify this Court interfering with an otherwise unimpeachable exercise of sentencing discretion. I myself might have imposed a fixed term in all the circumstances of the case, but it was well open to the sentencing Judge to impose the sentence that he did. The applicant’s complaint is really no more than one of convenience for a period of only four months. I can appreciate that he does not understand the rhyme or reason behind the refusal to transfer his parole. Nor do I on the material before this Court. Yet this Court’s jurisdiction is limited and cannot avail the applicant. His remedy must be sought from the executive, although I understand that his attempts have so far been futile. I am far from satisfied that this is a result that is unduly harsh or unreasonable having regard to the period of parole and the absence of any compelling reason of a medical or other nature requiring his immediate residence in Victoria. 
     
      
    22 For those reasons I propose that leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed.23 HODGSON JA: I agree.24 FULLERTON J: I also agree.25 HODGSON JA: The order of the court will be as Justice Howie has proposed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL : I agree with Latham J. 
     
      
    2 LATHAM J : The applicant pleaded guilty on 3 December 2008 to two charges in the Local Court, namely sexual intercourse with a child under 10, pursuant to s 66A of the Crimes Act 1900, carrying a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment and a standard non parole period of 15 years, and kidnapping, pursuant to s 86(1)(b) of the Crimes Act, carrying a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. On the 11 February 2009 the applicant was sentenced by his Honour Judge Garling (the judge) to a total term of 16 years imprisonment, within an aggregate non parole period of 12 years. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence.  
     
      
    3 On the kidnapping charge, the applicant was sentenced to a non parole period of six years, commencing 15 September 2008, expiring 14 September 2014, with an additional term of two years, expiring 14 September 2016. On the sexual intercourse charge, the applicant was sentenced to a non parole period of 10 years, commencing 15 September 2010, expiring 14 September 2020, with an additional term of four years expiring 14 September 2024. 
     
      
    4 Two grounds were argued on the appeal. The first claims that the degree of accumulation of the two sentences was excessive. The second claims that the sentence imposed in respect of the kidnapping charge was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
       
      The Offences 
       
      
    5 The circumstances of the offences were the subject of an agreed statement of facts (Exhibit A). The complainant was a five-year-old boy who was staying with his parents in a caravan park at Port Macquarie. The applicant rented a cabin at the same caravan park. In the afternoon of 15 September 2008, the complainant and his family were using the playground facilities at the caravan park. The applicant engaged the boy's parents in conversation. At about 4 p.m. the complainant’s father took his three sons to the shower block located within the park grounds. The applicant followed them and continued to speak with the complainant's father. After showering the children, they left the facilities whereupon the applicant said that he had forgotten his thongs and followed the family back to the cabins. 
     
      
    6 At about 6 p.m. the complainant's parents were preparing the dinner in the camp kitchen. The applicant walked into this area, placed a number of bottles of beer in the fridge and again engaged the parents in conversation. The complainant and his father went to the community TV room in the park and the applicant followed. After the complainant's father had returned to the kitchen area, the applicant spoke to the complainant and asked him if he wanted five dollars. The complainant said yes. The applicant took the complainant's hand and led him to nearby bushland, near the rear entrance to the caravan park. 
     
      
    7 Shortly after the complainant left the TV room, his father realised that he was missing and commenced to search the area with the assistance of a number of other persons. Meanwhile, in the bushland, the applicant removed the complainant's pants and underwear. The complainant described the applicant committing fellatio upon him for an indeterminate period of time. The complainant told the applicant that he wanted to go home. The applicant said to him ""I have your knickers"". However, the complainant dressed and left the area with the applicant. 
     
      
    8 At about this time, two other occupants of the caravan park were in the area looking for the complainant. They saw the applicant and the complainant walk from the bushland holding hands. The applicant was not confronted at this time. A short time later, when one of the occupants of the caravan park returned to this area with a torch, he saw the applicant crouching over slightly, holding the complainant's arm. The complainant appeared to be shaking and did not answer when he was asked his name. The applicant said that he had found the child next to a tennis centre. The complainant was separated from the applicant and taken back to his parents. The complainant said that he had been taken away by the applicant and that the applicant had asked him to ""suck his willy"". 
     
      
    9 The complainant's parents confronted the applicant on his return to the caravan park and told him that the police had been called. The applicant was prevented from getting into his vehicle. Shortly after when the police arrived and confronted the applicant, the applicant said ""I was watching tennis and saw a lost kid so I was taking him back to his parents"". The applicant was arrested and his property was searched. In his wallet were four individual pieces of yellow paper containing various messages written in black biro, including ""let me suck your dick, I’ll give you $100 cash"" and others to the same effect. 
     
      
    10 The applicant entered into a record of interview wherein he denied the allegations. He gave an account which was consistent with the version he had earlier given to police before his arrest. He claimed not to have known the complainant or had any contact with him before encountering him at the tennis courts. Later DNA analysis of the complainant's underpants revealed a quantity of DNA consistent with that of the applicant. 
     
      
       
      The Applicant’s History 
       
      
    11 At the time of the commission of the offences the applicant was 45 years of age. He had been the subject of previous supervision by the Probation and Parole Service, most relevantly in 1996 and 1999 for sexual offences involving children. In 1996 the applicant was sentenced to two years imprisonment with an additional term of two years for two counts of sexual intercourse with a child under 10 (several other offences of a like nature were taken into account on a Form One). In 1999 the applicant was convicted of loitering near a public place, being a registered child sexual offender, and received a minimum term of 18 months imprisonment with an additional term of six months. 
     
      
    12 The 1996 offences involved the commission of fellatio a number of times upon two male children (brothers, aged six and seven respectively) between January and August 1990 in circumstances that are not dissimilar to the instant offence. The applicant had befriended the complainants’ family and had committed some of the offences when visiting a park with each of the complainants. The applicant was not charged with these offences until October 1995. When he was arrested, the applicant denied all knowledge of the complainants and the family, despite evidence establishing that the applicant had contacted both of the complainants, who were then residing in the Northern Territory, since the commission of the offences, in order to discuss their sexual experiences. 
     
      
    13 The presentence report before the Judge noted that the applicant's ""response to supervision is best described as poor and uncommitted with frequent periods of supervision being breached by the offender due to re-offence (sic)."" Furthermore, the applicant's attendance and compliance with relevant programs whilst in custody was described as poor, with the exception of a sex offender-based program which the applicant undertook in 1998 when it appears ""he was motivated by the prospects of his impending release at that time."" 
     
      
    14 The applicant is the younger of two siblings, born to a family in Sydney where, according to the applicant, he was raised by an alcoholic father and a somewhat disengaged mother. The applicant married at the age of 20 and the marriage produced one child. Since the marriage ended in 1998 the applicant has had no contact with his former wife or child. He had been residing with his parents in Port Macquarie but was forced to leave the family home due to a falling out with his parents. At the time of the offences the applicant claimed he was essentially homeless. 
     
      
    15 The applicant left school after completing year 10 and has worked in a variety of unskilled labouring jobs since that time. He has been unable to secure employment and has relied on social security benefits over the last 10 years. 
     
      
    16 The applicant has a long-standing history of alcohol abuse and is receiving treatment for cataracts in both eyes. He has been diagnosed with depression and schizoid personality disorder and received treatment at the Ryde Mental Health Unit in 1994 and 1995. The applicant self-medicates with alcohol rather than remain compliant with ongoing supervision, medication and counselling. 
     
      
    17 The applicant's account to the Probation and Parole officer of the offences sought to excuse the applicant's conduct by the fact that he was allegedly intoxicated. However, the persistent cultivation of the complainant and the complainant's family over the course of the afternoon tends to contradict this explanation. More importantly, the applicant was resistant to participating in any further sex offenders programs, indicating to the Probation and Parole officer that he did not require that intervention. The applicant is presently in segregation and is unable to engage in any employment or education programs. He has been assessed by the prison psychologist as in the high range of risk factors relating to sexual re-offending. 
     
      
       
      Resolution of the Appeal 
       
      
    18 The remarks on sentence were brief and were delivered on the same day that the sentencing proceedings commenced and concluded. The Judge characterised the sexual intercourse charged as ""a very serious matter"" which ""fell well above the mid range of these types of offences"". No issue is taken with these findings. In respect of the kidnapping charge, the Judge went no further than to note that the second offence ""is also extremely serious [and that] this young child was taken from his parents, taken to bushland. He is five years of age. Whilst I do not know how long the prisoner intended to hold him, there is some merit in the Crown's submission that he intended perhaps to hold him for longer than he did and was reluctant to let him go."" 
     
      
       
      The Sentence for the Kidnapping Offence 
       
      
    19 Having regard to the sentence imposed in respect of the kidnapping offence, the starting point before the application of the 25% discount was in the order of 10 years and nine months imprisonment. It would appear therefore that the judge had determined that the kidnapping offence was close to an offence within the worst category, given that the maximum penalty is one of 14 years imprisonment. This is an assessment of the objective gravity of the offence with which I cannot agree.20 The combination of factors relevant to an assessment of the objective gravity of an offence under s 86 of the Crimes Act were identified by this Court in R v Collett & Robson (NSWCCA, unreported, 7 June 1979), per Roden J, as the duration of the detention, the extent of fear or terror occasioned, the manner of treatment and what is demanded of the victim by the offender, the purpose of the detention, and the extent (if any) to which third parties were subjected to ordeal or anguish by reason of fear for the welfare of the victim. 
     
      
    21 In R v Newell [2004] NSWCCA 183, Howie J (Bell and Hislop JJ agreeing) said :- 
     
      
       
        
        32 The gravamen of the offence for the purpose of sentencing is the unlawful detaining of a person. As his Honour noted, there are a number of factors that can be relevant in making an assessment of the seriousness of an offence under s 86 including the period of the detention, the circumstances of the detention, the person being detained and the purpose of the detention. The last factor, the nature of the advantage that the offender sought to obtain, is not, in my view, conclusive as to the seriousness of the offence.  
        
       
       
      This approach was reiterated by Howie J (Dunford J agreeing) in  
      R v Falls 
       [2004] NSWCCA 335. 
       
      
    22 The period of detention in this case was relatively brief and only for so long as it was necessary to commit the sexual offence. The tender age of the child is no doubt a factor to be taken into account. However, when the child indicated that he wished to go back to his parents, there is nothing to suggest that the applicant did anything to prolong the detention. In that respect, it was speculative to infer to the contrary, against the applicant’s interests.23 I accept that the complainant was terrified. The witness who first confronted the applicant saw the child trembling. I also accept that the child’s parents were traumatised by the child’s disappearance, but this was not a case where a third party was informed of the detention and threatened that if the offender’s demands were not met, some harm would be meted out to the victim. Given the child’s age, it was not necessary for the applicant to do anything other than offer the child money. As for the purpose of the detention, that is not determinative and the weight placed upon this factor in the circumstances of this case ought to have been approached with some care, at the risk of introducing an element of double punishment. 
     
      
    24 This was a serious offence, but I would not describe it as “extremely serious” in the absence of the type of factors that the courts have traditionally taken into account when determining where, in the range indicated by the maximum penalty, such an offence lies. A sentence of 8 years imprisonment would meet the objective gravity of this offence, before the application of the 25% discount. I would uphold this ground of the appeal. 
     
      
      The Degree of Accumulation 
       
      
    25 The applicant's counsel acknowledges that the degree of accumulation was a matter within the discretion of the Judge, and that some measure of accumulation was required in order to mark the totality of the applicant’s criminality. No patent error was identified.26 There is no complaint in respect of the refusal by the Judge to find special circumstances, nor is there a complaint in respect of the finding by the Judge to the effect that the applicant's criminal history disentitled him to any leniency. The applicant’s risk of re-offending was high and the protection of the community and personal deterrence were significant factors in the sentencing exercise. The Crown’s submission is that the degree of accumulation imposed by the Judge required the applicant to effectively serve only 2 years imprisonment referable solely to the kidnapping offence. 
     
      
    27 The question remains whether an aggregate sentence of 16 years imprisonment with an aggregate non parole period of 12 years is manifestly excessive. In my view, the answer is no. The applicant’s lack of insight into his offending, his poor response to supervision in the past and the questionable benefit of sex offender programmes he has undertaken, were matters of significant concern, notwithstanding a period of 7 years between his release from prison on the last occasion and the instant offences. The Judge placed considerable weight upon the Crown’s submission below that the applicant was “a danger to the community”. 
     
      
    28 Whilst the detention was an integral part of the applicant’s intention to sexually assault the child, which he accomplished by enticing the complainant away with the promise of money, the aggregate sentence and aggregate non parole period were required to reflect the criminality inherent in two discrete offences. The overall sentence may be legitimately considered a heavy one, but not in my view manifestly excessive. 
     
      
       
      Re-Sentencing 
       
      
    29 I propose the following orders :- 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal granted. 
       
       
      2. Appeal allowed in part. The sentence imposed on 11 February 2009 for the offence under s 86(1)(b) of the  
      Crimes Act 
       is quashed. 
      
      3. In lieu, a non parole period of 4 years is imposed, commencing 15 September 2008, expiring 14 September 2012, with a balance of term of 2 years expiring 14 September 2014.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: Following a trial before Acting Judge Maguire in the District Court of New South Wales, the appellant was convicted by a jury of an offence that, on or about 14 February 2007, he knowingly took part in the supply of a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine. The appellant appeals against conviction. There is no appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    2 On 14 February 2007 police officers arrested a man named Ricky Thoo. During a search of the garage which Thoo had just unlocked the police found, relevantly, two sports bags each containing a number of plastic bags.  
     
      
    3 There were 55 packages of methylamphetamine in the plastic bags. Some of those packages contained other plastic bags and in total there were 72 plastic bags. The appellant’s fingerprints were found on seven bags, of which five were plastic bags which contained other plastic bags and two which did not. 
     
      
    4 The seven packages upon which the appellant’s fingerprints were found were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) Item 24 – a knotted plastic bag containing five knotted bags, with a total of 139.4 grams of methylamphetamine; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) Item 25 – a knotted plastic bag containing five knotted bags, with a total of 139.2 grams of methylamphetamine; 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) Item 26 – a knotted plastic bag containing two knotted bags, with a total of 55.9 grams of methylamphetamine; 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) Item 30 – a knotted plastic bag containing five knotted bags, with a total of 139.1 grams of methylamphetamine; 
        
       
       
        
        (v) Item 31 – a knotted plastic bag containing four knotted bags, with a total of 111.3 grams of methylamphetamine. (The appellant’s fingerprint was located on one of these plastic bags); 
        
       
       
        
        (vi) Item 34 – a knotted plastic bag containing 15 knotted bags, with a total of 420.2 grams of methylamphetamine and ephedrine; and 
        
       
       
        
        (vii) Item 35 – a knotted plastic bag which contained 19.2 grams of methylamphetamine. 
        
       
      
    5 The total amount of methylamphetamine contained within these packages was 941.13 grams. The commercial quantity applicable to methylamphetamine is 250 grams. The total amount of the methylamphetamine found in all of the bags was 1.4 kilograms. 
     
      
    6 The case against the appellant was entirely circumstantial. Indeed, there was only one circumstance, namely the presence of his fingerprint on the seven plastic bags. There was no other evidence linking him to the garage or to any other aspect of the supply of the drugs. 
     
      
    7 The issue for the jury to determine was whether this evidence was sufficient to discharge the Crown’s onus of proof. The critical factor was a judgment about the number of separate bags upon which the appellant’s fingerprints appeared. Out of the 72 bags, his fingerprints were on seven, i.e. about 10 percent. 
     
      
    8 The defence case sought to establish a reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury or, alternatively, to satisfy the test for a circumstantial case that the prosecution had not discharged its onus to exclude a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence, on the basis of proof of circumstances in which the appellant’s fingerprints could have been placed on the plastic bags. 
     
      
    9 The defence called a witness, David Brady, who had previously worked as the manager of a mobile telephone company called “Allphones”. This company was owned by Ricky Thoo. Mr Brady ceased working at the company in September 2006. He affirmed that the company was a legitimate business selling mobile telephones and accessories. He gave evidence, confirmed by others, that the appellant was a close friend of Shannon Thoo, Ricky’s brother. 
     
      
    10 Brady said that the appellant would come to the shop “to pick up repairs that needed to be done, phones or accessories”. He said that when he picked up the items for repairs they were packaged in “zip-lock or sort of shopping-style freezer bags”. He was shown Exhibit 1 (which were bags of the kind in which the drugs subject of the charge were found) and confirmed that these were the same style of bags as the ones used by Allphones. He said that he had seen the appellant touch such plastic bags in the course of his duties working for Thoo’s telephone business. 
     
      
    11 In cross-examination he affirmed that freezer bags of the kind in which the drugs were found had been used in the shop. They were contained in a plastic bag which held about 120 of the freezer bags. He also affirmed that the appellant picked up repairs for delivery and did so about two or three times per week. He also picked the items up after they had been repaired and brought them back in freezer bags. 
     
      
    12 In re-examination he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q He’d take the phones away in plastic bags? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q And he’d bring them back in plastic bags? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes.” 
        
       
      
    13 The defence case was reinforced by cross-examination of Crown witnesses.  
     
      
    14 A police forensic officer, Detective Garry Sarksissian, gave the following evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q … it’s true, isn’t it that there is no way of telling from a surface when the print was applied? 
        
       
       
        
        A No. The only thing you can take into effect is potentially the age of the object, but you can’t tell the age of the print. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Not from the print? 
        
       
       
        
        A Not from the print. 
        
       
       
        
        Q No, if a newspaper came out today and there was a fingerprint on it and you examined it tomorrow you would be able to say how old that print was within a day? 
        
       
       
        
        A Exactly, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q But a thing like a freezer bag that you’ve got in front of you no way in the world could you say within a year when the print went on? 
        
       
       
        
        A No. If the bag was produced a year ago, sold at a certain time, if you could trace all that information then you could narrow down, but you can’t tell exactly when the print was put on there. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q The other thing that you can’t advance any opinion [on] is where the bag was when the fingerprint was applied to it? 
        
       
       
        
        A Oh no. 
        
       
       
        
        Q A third thing you can’t advance any opinion on is what was in the bag, if anything, when the print went on it? 
        
       
       
        
        A No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q The prints you found might have been applied when the bags were empty, correct? 
        
       
       
        
        A Correct.” 
        
       
      
    15 Detective Senior Constable John Guminuk gave similar evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q You agree that you can’t possibly say when Mr Hong touched the bags? 
        
       
       
        
        A I agree to that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q You agree that you can’t possibly say that the bags were not empty when he touched them? 
        
       
       
        
        A I agree to that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q You cannot say that others did not touch the bags after Mr Hong did? 
        
       
       
        
        A I agree to that.” 
        
       
      
    16 Detective Senior Constable Andrew Lam conducted extensive surveillance of the premises where the drugs were found and of Ricky Thoo. He agreed that: 
     
      
       
        There was no evidence that the appellant had “anything to do with the [premises]”. 
       
       
        None of the appellant’s fingerprints were found on any surface within the premises. 
       
       
        No DNA evidence had identified the appellant as having attended the premises. 
       
       
        No evidence of traces of drugs was found on the surfaces of the bags where the appellant’s fingerprints were found.  
       
       
        Thoo owned and ran a phone shop at the time of the offences and this was apparently a legitimate business. 
       
       
        Thoo had told police that the appellant “had nothing to do with the drugs” and also that the appellant ran errands for the telephone business and may have touched the bags in the course of that employment. 
       
      
    17 The critical facts upon which the appellant relied in this Court were as follows: 
     
      
       
        The fingerprints of the appellant could have been placed on the bags at any time up to a year prior to 14 February 2007. 
       
       
        The evidence of the fingerprint expert could not establish whether the plastic bags were empty at the time the fingerprints were placed on them. 
       
       
        The plastic bags on which the appellant’s fingerprints were found were examined for traces of methylamphetamine and found to contain none. 
       
       
        The appellant provided a DNA sample to police. However, there was no evidence of his DNA being found on the sports bags. 
       
       
        There was no evidence other than the fingerprints on the plastic bags connecting the appellant to the sports bags or anything else in the garage. 
       
       
        Thoo leased the garage in which the drugs were found. 
       
       
        Surveillance evidence did not disclose the appellant in company with Thoo or attending the garage. 
       
       
        The appellant was a friend of Thoo’s brother and had worked for Thoo at his mobile telephone business transporting telephones and accessories for repair. 
       
       
        The telephones and accessories were transported in resealable plastic bags of the same kind found by the police to contain drugs. 
       
       
        In the course of his employment the appellant had touched the same or similar plastic bags to those in which the drugs were found. 
       
       
        This had occurred around five months prior to 14 February 2007. 
       
      
    18 With respect to the third last bullet point above, the Crown has pointed out that the plastic bags in which the drugs were contained were not “resealable” bags but were “freezer” bags of the character about which Mr Brady gave evidence. 
     
      
    19 With respect to the last bullet point, the period reflects the time between Mr Brady leaving his employment at Allphones and the date of discovery of the drugs. There is no basis, however, for an inference that the appellant’s attendance at these premises had ceased. 
     
      
    20 The first ground of appeal is that the verdict is unreasonable and unable to be supported having regard to the evidence or otherwise represents a miscarriage of justice. If this ground of appeal is upheld, then this Court would quash the verdict of guilty and enter a verdict of acquittal. Four other grounds of appeal which are directed to alleged errors in the directions by the trial judge would, if upheld, lead to an order for a new trial. If the first ground is upheld it is unnecessary to deal with the other grounds. 
     
      
    21 The principles applicable to the unreasonable verdict ground of appeal are well established. The Court must ask itself whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty. (M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493; MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606 at [25], [55]-[57].) The principles have recently been summarised in Rasic v Regina [2009] NSWCCA 202 at [25], [26] and [30]. 
     
      
    22 In light of the evidence of the appellant’s contact with plastic bags on the premises, the defence case was entitled to substantial weight. The appellant did not give evidence. Nevertheless, the evidence of actual contact with the plastic bags was striking. There is a real issue as to whether, in the light of this evidence, it was open to the jury to conclude that the fingerprints were placed on the bags when they contained drugs or in the course of preparing them for use in that way. 
     
      
    23 The Court was referred to other cases in which accused persons were acquitted, notwithstanding the presence of their fingerprints on incriminating material. (R v Laing (NSWCCA, 20 June 1996, unreported); R v Zouras [2002] VSCA 182.) It was also referred to cases in which persons were convicted on the basis of the presence of fingerprints, notwithstanding the absence of other incriminating evidence. (See R v Ingivald (NSWCCA, 14 April 1989, unreported); Chahine v R [2006] NSWCCA 179 and Halmi v R [2008] NSWCCA 259.)  
     
      
    24 I do not find assistance from these authorities. Each case turns on its facts. It is not helpful to seek to compare the facts of this case with the different range of facts that arose in these other cases. 
     
      
    25 If the fingerprints had appeared on only one or two bags then I have no doubt what the answer would be. Similarly, if the fingerprints had appeared on a significant majority the bags, I have no doubt what the answer would be. The critical issue in this case is whether the fact that fingerprints appeared on seven out of 72 bags was sufficient to tip the scales and enable the Crown to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, or alternatively, to disprove the hypothesis consistent with innocence.  
     
      
    26 The Crown case was in such a narrow compass that it does not appear that anything turned on the advantage which the jury had of observing the witnesses. The only exception to this is the evidence of Brady, who was cross-examined in such a way as to suggest that his evidence about the freezer bags may not be accepted. However, it was not put to him that any of the events to which he testified never happened. 
     
      
    27 The materials available to the Court do not include the Crown submissions. However, the Crown submissions in this Court do not suggest that the jury was asked to reject Mr Brady’s evidence either in total or as to any particular, eg the frequency of the appellant’s attendance at the premises. The Crown case was to emphasise the number of different bags on which the appellant’s fingerprints appear. 
     
      
    28 In these circumstances the respect which this Court must show to the jury’s judgment is somewhat attenuated. I have less difficulty than may often be the case in applying the proposition in M v The Queen supra at 494: 
     
      
       
        
        “In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced.” 
        
       
      
    29 I have such a doubt. In my opinion, it was not open to the jury to convict the appellant. The Crown had not discharged its onus of excluding the reasonable hypothesis that the appellant’s fingerprints were placed on the plastic bags in the course of his employment. That is a hypothesis consistent with innocence. 
     
      
    30 The appellant attended the premises two to three times per week. He did so over an extended period of time. His practice was to carry equipment for repair in plastic bags and to bring back that equipment after repair in such bags. He must have touched numerous bags. The evidence, which was questioned, but not ultimately challenged in cross-examination, that bags were kept for reuse, is entitled to weight. Accordingly, it is possible that as many as seven such bags, that were ultimately used in a business of drug supply, were touched by the appellant as an employee of the legitimate business in which he was employed. 
     
      
    31 It is not necessary to deal with other grounds of appeal. However, I do wish to make some observations about the submissions on one ground.  
     
      
    32 The appellant submitted that the trial judge erred in failing to give a direction in the terms of a passage set out at [27] of the joint judgment in Mahmood v Western Australia [2008] HCA 1; (2008) 232 CLR 387. Whether or not such a direction was necessary depends on the force of that authority and the cases referred to therein. That need not be decided. 
     
      
    33 The appellant’s submissions, however, sought to reinforce this ground on the basis that the Criminal Trial Courts Bench Book had been amended to take into account the observations in Mahmood.  
     
      
    34 As this Court has said on previous occasions, the Bench Book should not be relied upon in this way. (See R v Zoef [2005] NSWCCA 268 at [93]; R v Forbes [2005] NSWCCA 377; (2005) 160 A Crim R 1 at [72]-[76].) The contents of the Bench Book are no more than suggested guidance for trial judges.  
     
      
    35 As I state in the Foreword to the Bench Book: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is a danger that publication of standard directions will convert a summing-up into a series of formulae which are not necessarily appropriate to the facts and circumstances of each particular case. For that reason, it is important to recognise that, subject to any appellate indications to the contrary, no particular form of words is required and an individual judge is free to depart from the suggested directions and to direct the jury as he or she thinks fit, provided that the directions are in accordance with the law. 
        
       
       
        
        On the other hand, the advantage of standard directions is that, properly used, they improve the efficiency of the administration of criminal justice and assist in eliminating error on the part of trial judges. The draft directions are intended to remind judges of what has to be said and to suggest a way in which it can be said. The directions are not intended to constitute an authoritative statement of the law, nor is it the case that the whole of each direction will be appropriate in each case. In all respects the directions ought be adapted to the circumstances of the individual case and the legal issues which have arisen. 
        
       
       
        
        ... 
        
       
       
        
        It is appropriate to reiterate that the  
        Bench Book  
        does not contain an authoritative statement of the law. Practitioners should not act on the basis that a failure to direct in accordance with the  
        Bench Book  
        is of itself indicative of legal error for appellate purposes. Authority for what ought have been in the contents of a direction in a particular case will need to be identified elsewhere.” 
        
       
      
    36 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
        
        1 Appeal allowed. 
        
       
       
        
        2 The conviction and sentence are quashed. 
        
       
       
        
        3 Direct a verdict of acquittal. 
        
       
      
    37 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Spigelman CJ. 
     
      
    38 GROVE J: I also agree.

     Judgment 
      
       
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Ainslie-Wallace DCJ on 27 March 2009 at Sydney District Court.  
     
      
    2 The applicant pleaded guilty to two offences, each of which was committed on 16 January 2008. The first charged robbery and wounding, being armed with an offensive weapon and the second charged assault with intent to rob and wounding, being armed with an offensive weapon. In each instance the weapon was a knife and the prescribed maximum penalty was imprisonment for twenty-five years. 
     
      
    3 The applicant was aged under fifteen years three months when he offended. He had no record of prior conviction. 
     
      
    4 The offences were committed in the company of two other juveniles, JW and JM. I draw the following facts substantially from Remarks on Sentence by Ainslie-Wallace DCJ. The three of them were seated on a park bench near Allawah Railway Station at about 10.30 pm. The victim walked past and, as he did, he was kicked from behind and fell to his knees. JW held a knife at his throat and demanded money. The victim produced his wallet and handed over about $100. JW asked whether this was all the money he had and struck him with his knee, causing the victim to become unbalanced. The applicant approached at this time and held a knife to the victim’s throat with one hand and grasped him around the chest with the other and asked where his phone was. Moving his hand, the victim contacted the knife blade and sustained cuts to three fingers. JM asked how much money had been given, and JW began searching the victim for his phone. The victim produced it and gave it to JM, who tossed it away saying “go fetch”. These circumstances constitute the first charge.  
     
      
    5 The three offenders ran to the railway station and boarded a train to Rockdale at about 10.56 pm. At 11.10 pm the victim of the second offence alighted from a train at Rockdale. He telephoned his uncle asking him to escort him home. The uncle arrived and the two of them began walking and, as they did, they passed the three offenders who were seated on a wall. They got up and commenced to follow the pair. The latter became aware of this and quickened their pace and finally broke into a run. The three offenders ran after them.  
     
      
    6 Upon arriving home, the uncle ran down the side of the house and the victim, having passed through the front gate, stopped at the door. JM and JW stood outside the gate. The applicant entered through the gate and approached, whereupon the victim said, “What do you want?” The applicant said, “I need money, give me money.” The victim said, “I will give you money. This is my house.” The applicant moved closer, then reached into his pants and pulled out a knife, flicking its blade open. He held the knife close to the victim who grasped at it, sustaining a small wound to his left and right index fingers. It is noted that her Honour referred only to the left finger whereas the tendered facts referred to both left and right index fingers. 
     
      
    7 The victim then said, “I will give you money. I’m going to call the police.” One of the other offenders said, “Let’s go,” and the applicant then ran down the stairs, through the gate and the three of them ran to another railway station, boarding a train and alighting at Hurstville. These facts constituted the second charge.  
     
      
    8 Police obtained access to the product of CCTV cameras and, on the day following, an officer recognised them and all three were arrested.  
     
      
    9 Her Honour sentenced the applicant for the first offence to imprisonment, consisting of a non parole period of 1 year 3 months commencing on 27 March 2009 and expiring on 26 June 2010, with a balance term of 1 year 9 months and, for the second offence, to imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of 1 year 3 months, commencing on 27 June 2009 and expiring on 26 September 2010, with a balance term of 2 years.  
     
      
    10 The total effective sentence amounted to a head sentence of 3 years 6 months with a non parole period of 1 year 6 months.  
     
      
    11 JM appeared for sentence before her Honour on the same day as the applicant and on the same charges. On the first charge he was sentenced to imprisonment for twenty-two months, suspended upon entering into a bond to be of good behaviour for that term and, on the second charge, to perform seventy hours community service. JM was aged fourteen at the time of the offences. Although he was liable as a joint participant, her Honour found that he did not produce a knife nor did he see the others produce a knife. He had participated in an interview with police and, at the time JW having pleaded not guilty, offered to give evidence for the Crown. It is not argued there should be parity between the applicant and JM in the way they were respectively treated.  
     
      
    12 However, JW ultimately pleaded guilty to the same two offences as the applicant and JM and appeared before North DCJ, who sentenced him to imprisonment for 2 years, suspended upon condition that he enter into a bond to be of good behaviour for that term on the first count and, on the second count, to perform eighty hours community service. 
     
      
    13 The Crown appealed against those sentences asserting that they were manifestly inadequate. The appeal was heard by a bench of five judges, a principal issue for determination being the application of the recently legislated s 68A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. That provision is not germane to the present appeal.  
     
      
    14 The court divided on the question of the inadequacy of sentence: R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49. The majority (McClellan CJ at CL, Howie and Johnson JJ) held that the sentences in respect of both counts were manifestly inadequate. Spigelman CJ (Allsop P agreeing) held that the sentence imposed of two years was not manifestly inadequate on the first count and the decision to suspend the sentence was not outside the proper exercise of discretion.  
     
      
    15 On the second count the Chief Justice held that the community service order was not within the range of permissible exercise of discretion and proposed quashing that order and in lieu thereof imposing the same sentence as that on the first count, namely, imprisonment for two years, suspended subject to conditions.  
     
      
    16 The majority agreed in the final outcome of the appeal as proposed by the Chief Justice “only after considerable hesitation” and expressed the opinion that it could only be justified “in the light of events that have occurred since the original sentences were imposed.” They stated (JW at par 210): 
     
      
       
        
        “In our opinion the sentence that the Chief Justice proposes can only be justified in light of the events that have occurred since the original sentences were imposed. In particular the period of 7 months that has transpired since North DCJ sentenced the respondent is a considerable period of time in the life of a juvenile who was aged 15 years at the time of the offences. In the meantime he has been carrying out his Community Service once it was brought to the attention of those responsible for its supervision that it should not have been suspended as a result of the Crown bringing an appeal to this Court. He had at the time of the writing of the most recent Juvenile Justice report, which is dated 28 January of this year, completed 25 hours of Community Service. We presume he has completed more hours since then. The latest report shows that the respondent has been complying with his supervision and attempting to address issues in his life. The report indicates that the respondent would ‘benefit from continuing to develop greater insight into this offence and strategies to reduce the likelihood of re-offending in the future.’ He should now be given that opportunity by the Court exercising its discretion and imposing a lesser sentence than was warranted at first instance.”  
        
       
       
        
       
      
    17 Thus, the final outcome was that JW is subject on each count to imprisonment for 2 years, suspended on conditions. 
     
      
    18 The applicant relies upon two grounds of appeal. Ground 1 asserts that the sentencing judge erred in having regard to the standard non parole period. The Crown Prosecutor had informed her Honour that the offence carried a standard non parole period of seven years: T 20/02/09 p 2. She made express reference to this when commencing her Remarks on Sentence and again when assessing the objective seriousness of the offences. Her Honour had been misinformed.  
     
      
    19 The specification of a standard non parole period does not apply to offenders who were under the age of eighteen at the time of offending: s 54D(3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, taking effect from 1 January 2009.  
     
      
    20 In written submissions to this court the Crown has acknowledged the error but submitted that no lesser sentence is warranted in law: s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    21 A consequence of the demonstration of the particular error in the context of the remarks is a conclusion that it operated to the disadvantage of the applicant. Her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Both offences are matters to which a standard non-parole period applies. That non-parole period represents the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness of offences of this type.” 
         
          
        
       
      
      
    22 She then expressed reasons for concluding that both offences fell below mid range objective seriousness and then added:  
     
      
       
        
        “Nonetheless, the standard non-parole period remains relevant to the sentence.” 
        
       
      
    23 The second ground of appeal asserted: “There is erroneous disparity between the sentence of the applicant and the sentence of the co-offender JW.” 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    24 Each of the sentencing judges (Ainslie-Wallace DCJ and North DCJ) made a sentence assessment upon the evidence before them in individual cases. There were marked differences in the relevant findings. The applicant was found to have used a knife in both offences whereas North DCJ was unable to reach a positive conclusion whether JW had a knife. Of course they were participants in a joint criminal enterprise and both liable for the full range of criminal acts done by anyone in furtherance of it: R v Wright [2009] NSWCCA 3. Nevertheless, individual acts may point to differences in culpability: GAS and SJK v The Queen (2004) 217 CLR 198.  
     
      
    25 There was notable contrast between the subjective cases of JW and the applicant. Ainslie-Wallace DCJ found that, in his evidence in the proceedings, the applicant appeared reluctant to accept the frank criminality of his conduct. Then, and to the maker of a Juvenile Justice report he said, in effect, that he did not think the offence was so serious. Such remorse as he exhibited seemed to focus upon his own jeopardy. He had significant support from his family and others but assessment of his prospects of rehabilitation were described by her Honour as “difficult”. However, her Honour thought the evidence in total pointed to the applicant lacking sufficient maturity to understand the nature of his crime and the need to empathise with the victims. 
     
      
    26 A letter from the school principal recounted that the applicant was studying years 11 and 12 at the Endeavour Sports High School. He was described as bright and co-operative, pleasant and with ability. He was regarded as a talented sportsman.  
     
      
    27 North DCJ made this observation about JW’s appreciation of the seriousness of the offence:  
     
      
       
        
        “These offences have clearly penetrated his consciousness and I am heartened by the fact that he has not only remained trouble free, but has acknowledged his remorse to Mr Champion and in the background reports.” 
        
       
      
     
     
      
    28 Other matters which were taken into account (see JW at par 178) were that, as a child, JW had been exposed to domestic violence and sexual abuse, that he had learning difficulties and a low IQ and been assessed in the bottom 14 percentile of the population, that for some eight months he had been on strict bail including a curfew that kept him at home each evening, that he had not breached bail and that since the offences he had (presumably from a combination of stress factors) lost some thirty kilograms. 
     
      
    29 These contrasts, in my view, reveal relevant factors in sentence assessment of such weight and significance as to justify the discrimination in the individual treatment of the applicant and JW as well as the difference in objective findings to which I have referred. Accordingly, any sense of grievance which the applicant harbours on account of the difference in treatment is not justified.  
     
      
    30 I return, however, to the establishment of the complaint comprehended in ground 1. The use of the reference to the standard non parole period, as discussed above, was a material error. The applicant puts before the court evidence of his post sentence conduct. That evidence is subjectively favourable to the applicant. It is available to be considered when determining whether some other sentence should have been passed in accordance with s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act upon which the Crown sought to rely: Douar v The Queen (2005) 159 A Crim R 154; Baxter v The Queen (2007) 173 A Crim R 284.  
     
      
    31 Post sentence, the applicant has completed his year 11 studies, a certificate in information technology and is attending courses in visual arts and mechanics. He is making practical use of his time in custody.  
     
      
    32 He is now classified B3, which carries an entitlement to leave the detention centre on outings. This is the highest classification and requires a display of good behaviour and commitment to educational programs in order to achieve it.  
     
      
    33 The Assistant Principal and Deputy Principal of the detention centre education and training unit certified that the applicant had been applying himself to his studies, interacts well with other students and is polite and respectful towards staff.  
     
      
    34 A report of the Serious Young Offenders Review Panel is confirmatory of these matters. There was no challenge to his detail of misbehaviour reports, which included wearing a shirt on his head instead of the customary way, scraping initials on a school desk and referring to an employee of the centre as “a snitch”. Such behaviour, although disappointing and undermining of perfection, would not seriously diminish the overall impression of genuine progress towards rehabilitation which is otherwise observable. 
     
      
    35 In my view, this court should intervene to signal the removal of whatever contribution to the flawed giving of account to the seven-year standard non parole period specified may have made to sentence assessment and, to reflect the elevated overall conduct of the applicant’s subjective case, we should take into account the post sentence good conduct.  
     
      
    36 Although I perceive no error in her Honour’s order for partial accumulation in respect of the sentences for the separate offences, I observe that the expiry of the non parole period for the first offence is scheduled in about two months’ time and in respect of the second offence in about five months’ time.  
     
      
    37 It would accommodate the findings I have mentioned if the sentence for the second offence was adjusted to the same length as that for the first offence and made concurrent. I repeat, that does not indicate a finding of error in ordering accumulation but in the circumstances of the imminence of the expiry of non parole periods, it is a practical way of implementing this judgment and does not reduce either sentence into the category of being manifestly inadequate.  
     
      
    38 I would propose the following orders: 
     
      
      1. The application for leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
       
      2. The appeal allowed in part. 
      
      
      3. Sentence and orders in respect of count 2 (assault with intent to rob being armed and wounding) quashed. In lieu thereof the applicant sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of one year three months, commencing on 27 March 2009 and expiring on 26 June 2010 with a balance term of one year and nine months, commencing on 27 June 2010. 
       
      4. That sentence to be served concurrently with the sentence on count 1. 
       
      5. The applicant ordered released to parole on 26 June 2010.  
       
       
      
    39 HISLOP J: I agree.  
     
      
    40 HANDLEY AJA: I also agree. The order of the court will be as announced by Justice Grove.
