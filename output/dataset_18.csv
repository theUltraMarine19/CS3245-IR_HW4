This was an appeal from a decision of the district judge convicting the appellant on seven charges of illegal moneylending contrary to s 8(1)(b) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188) (the Act) and four charges of harassment contrary to s 33(1).
Section 8(1)(b) reads: 
 
If any person ... carries on a business as a moneylender without holding a licence ... he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 and for a second or subsequent offence to a fine of not less than $20,000 and not more than $200,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both ... .
 
 
 
And s 33(1) reads: 
 
Any moneylender who, personally, or by any person acting on his behalf, harasses or intimidates his debtor, any member of the debtor`s family or any other person in connection with the loan to the debtor at, or watches or besets, the residence or place of business or employment of the debtor, the member of the debtor`s family or that other person, or any place at which the debtor receives his wages or any other sum periodically due to him, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of not less than $2,000 and not more than $20,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both ... .
 
 
 
A total fine of $123,000 was imposed.
After hearing the appeal, this court amended the four charges of harassment to charges of intimidation. The appeal was then dismissed save for one of the charges of intimidation. The reasons are now given.
 The prosecution`s case below 
It was alleged that the appellant had lent money illegally to Chong Chew Hua (Chong) and Ling Ing Hoi (Ling) separately on various occasions in 1994. After both Chong and Ling had failed to pay off the amounts outstanding, the appellant had harassed Goh Keng Leong (Goh), Chong`s husband, and Khoo Lea Heng (Khoo), Ling`s wife.
 Chong 
Chong was an operator of a gambling den in Lorong Ah Soo with Ling and several others. In early October 1994, she borrowed $2,000 from the appellant, which was to be paid through daily payments of $120 for 20 to 30 days. However, after making payments for just about a week, Chong, who was by this time operating a den at Bedok, borrowed another $3,000, which was to be repaid by daily sums of $180 for 20 days. Another loan of $3,000 was again taken in a week`s time, on the same terms and without repayment of the earlier loan; on this occasion Chong was at Tampines. Finally, after another week`s payments, a fourth loan of $2,000 was taken with repayment of $120 per day for 20 days. At this point, Chong was operating a den in Balestier. No payment was ever made on this loan. None of the loans made were documented.
At the end of November, Chong`s husband, Goh, said that he was paged by the appellant, who identified himself as `Ah Long`. Goh was told that his wife had failed to repay a loan of $10,000. When the appellant was informed that Chong was missing, he told Goh that the latter ought to repay the money owed. In addition, the appellant also instructed him to locate Chong. In the course of the conversation, vulgarities were used against Goh. The appellant also accused Chong of committing robbery by failing to pay the loan.
Subsequently in February 1995, while Goh was outside his flat praying, the appellant, accompanied by another person, approached Goh and identified himself as `Ah Long`. The appellant asked for the wife. Even though she was actually in the house sleeping, Goh told the appellant that Chong was not at home. Upon hearing this, the appellant instructed Goh to inform Chong to contact the appellant within three days. No threats were made on this occasion.
 Ling 
As regards Ling, the prosecution`s case was that, while he was operating a Hougang gambling den in July 1994, he had borrowed $8,000 from the appellant. Of the total principal, $3,000 was to be paid back through daily payments of $60 running until the portion was repaid, while the remaining $5,000 was to be paid by daily payments of $300 for 20 days.
After completing payments for the first loan, Ling took out another loan of $15,000. In this instance, $5,000 was to be repaid over 20 days with daily payments of $300. As for the balance of $10,000, daily interest of $200 was levied until the principal sum was repaid. Payment of the $5,000 portion was completed; the interest on the $10,000 tranche was paid for a month, but the principal sum was never repaid.
In late October 1994, Ling borrowed a further $20,000. Again the amount was separated into one tranche of $5,000 and another of $15,000. Payment for the first tranche was through daily instalments of $300 for 20 days, while for the latter tranche daily interest of $300 was charged up to the repayment of the principal. For eight to nine days, Ling paid the interest on the $5,000 but eventually stopped. No interest was paid on the $15,0000. Ling went into hiding in Johore. In none of the loans were documents signed.
In November, Khoo, Ling`s wife, was visited in the early morning by someone calling himself `Ah Long`, later identified as the appellant, and at least one other person. That person got Khoo to page for Ling, who was told that there was someone looking for him. The appellant tried to speak to Ling directly, but Khoo refused him entry.
In December, the appellant, again accompanied, visited Khoo one evening. This time they spoke through the door grilles. Khoo refused to page for Ling as requested by the appellant. The appellant informed her that Ling was indebted to him, and that, if Ling failed to pay, the debt would, in his words, remain forever. Khoo did not understand what was meant by that remark, but was scared.
 The arrest 
In January 1995, Chong returned home to find, on the landing walls graffiti in Chinese which carried her address and a demand for repayment. She made a police report. On 8 February, a meeting was arranged by Chong, at the suggestion of the police, with the appellant, at a fast food outlet at Cathay Building. When the appellant met her, he was arrested by police officers.
Upon investigation, it was found that the appellant was not a licensed moneylender.
 The defence 
The appellant in his defence stated that he was indeed owed $10,000 by Chong and $15,000 by Ling, but in both cases the amounts owed were gambling debts. In his version of events, the appellant said that in October 1994, he had gambled with Chong and Ling at the den in Balestier. Chong and Ling lost to him. At first they had paid up their debts during the course of the game, but subsequently they told him that they would have to pay him at the end of the gambling session. When it came to that point though, they further postponed repayment to the next day. The appellant understood by this that payment was to be effected at the den, although no time was specified. While normally the appellant would not have allowed others to owe him debts incurred in gambling, he thought that Chong and Ling were reliable as they were den operators. The appellant alleged that no interest was to be charged on either of the amounts.
The next day though, Chong and Ling did not turn up. The appellant tried paging Ling but got no response. In February 1995, the appellant eventually managed to get Chong`s address. Late one night in that month, at about 11pm, he went to the address alone, but only found Goh, who told him that Chong was not around. Goh was asked to contact Chong, but no such attempt was made. As no useful response could be elicited from Goh, the appellant left. The appellant claimed that no obscenities were used then.
The next day, Chong had contacted him, and arranged the meeting at which the appellant was arrested. The appellant denied approaching Ling or his family concerning the $15,000 owed to him.
In several statements made to the police, the appellant denied being an illegal moneylender and harassing anyone. In all of the statements he stated that he had been merely trying to collect gambling debts.
The appellant further explained in his defence in court that he had investments in Taiwan. On several occasions in August, September and October 1994, the appellant was abroad in Taiwan, Malaysia and Indonesia.
One Tan Bee Kin (Tan) testified for the defence. She had been employed as a worker in the gambling den, and had seen the appellant, whom she had known for about nine years, gambling there. During the last occasion when she saw the appellant together with Chong and Ling, she had ceased to work and was in fact only delivering something. She said that the appellant was there occasionally. At no time did she ever see the appellant giving loans. Her testimony was that she had heard Ling saying that he owed the appellant $1,000. Her testimony was largely the same in regard to Chong.
Another witness for the defence was Lim Lai Wah (Lim), who was a gambler and had known the appellant for about seven years. She said that the appellant was an occasional gambler. According to her, the appellant gambled with a group including her as well as Chong and Ling. During this session, the two lost heavily, and eventually told the appellant that they would pay him the next day.
 Decision below 
The judge considered that the appellant`s version did not raise a reasonable doubt in the prosecution`s case. In coming to his decision, the judge was of the opinion that both Chong`s and Ling`s evidence had to be scrutinized carefully and was conscious that both of them had been engaged in illegal activities. Nonetheless, he found that their version was credible. He considered that these witnesses could have given less elaborate versions if they had merely wanted to fabricate something.
The judge also noted that counsel for the appellant had not put the appellant`s version, namely, that the debts were gambling losses wagered during a single sitting, to either Chong or Ling. Neither was it put to Ling that the appellant was owed only $15,000 instead of $43,000.
As for the evidence of the two defence witnesses, Tan and Lim, this was considered suspect, particularly since the two were friends of the appellant. The judge noted an inconsistency in the evidence of Lim, who had said that Chong and Ling had arranged payment the next day in the course of the game, even though the appellant himself had stated that the two had only made that arrangement at the end of the game. A similar difficulty was highlighted by the judge as regards the evidence of Tan.
Further, it was considered strange that the two debtors could pay off losses due to others but not to the appellant, and that the appellant was so ready to postpone payment, without adequate safeguards. Finally, as regards the harassment, the judge found the evidence of the prosecution witnesses credible and true.
The judge therefore convicted the appellant on all 11 charges. In sentencing the appellant, it was observed that there were no relevant antecedents. The appellant`s declining to put forward anything in mitigation was also noted. It was considered that a deterrent sentence depriving the appellant of his ill-gotten gains had to be imposed. In the event a total of $123,000 in fines was imposed.
 The appeal 
The appellant`s case on appeal
It was argued that the evidence of Chong and Ling had to be treated with caution and that the judge ought to have directed his mind to the danger of convicting on their uncorroborated evidence as the two witnesses had purposes of their own to serve.
It was also argued that the fact that the two witnesses were able to give the detailed mechanics of repayment, and that Ling had described an elaborate division of loans into separate tranches was not conclusive, given that the two were engaged in illegal activities themselves. Too much emphasis was placed as well by the judge on the acquaintanceship of the defence witnesses and the appellant. The inconsistencies found by the judge in the evidence of the defence witnesses were not material or significant. It was also argued that there was nothing strange in the appellant allowing Chong and Ling to owe him money. The evidence of Goh and Khoo was also suspect as there could have been collusion between them and their respective spouses. The appellant`s visit at Chong`s home, which on his evidence was at 11pm, was not harassment simply because of the time of the visit.
The appellant pointed to the fact that Chong and Ling were gambling operators and that there were no supporting documents to indicate that his defence ought to be accepted. Also, the prosecution ought to have called as witnesses other gamblers at the dens who were present during the supposed visits by the appellant to collect money; as these were not called, a presumption that their evidence would be unfavourable to the prosecution operated. Further, the appellant argued that the sentence was manifestly excessive as the fines would be crushing, while the offences committed were not of the most serious sort.
The prosecution case
The prosecution`s arguments were directed primarily towards reiterating the findings made by the trial judge. It was also argued that the sentences were not manifestly excessive in light of various precedents.
 The issues 
The following issues arose:
 
 
(1) The evaluation of the evidence 
 
(2) Sentencing
  
 
 
No argument had been taken that the appellant was not engaged in the business of moneylending.
 The evaluation of the evidence 
The basis of the discussion of this issue will be the contentions raised by the appellant in his petition. These may be grouped as follows:
 
 
(i) the effect of the evidence of a person with an interest to serve; 
 
(ii) the acceptance by the judge of the evidence of Chong and Ling, and the rejection of that of the appellant, and his witnesses Lim and Tan; 
 
(iii) whether the appellant`s first visit to Chong`s flat amounted to harassment; and 
 
(iv) the failure of the prosecution to produce certain witnesses.
  
 
 
 
 
 The evidence of a person with an interest to serve 
 
 
 
It was argued that the judge ought to have noted that Chong and Ling had their own interests to serve in giving evidence against the appellant, that is, to avoid repayment of the supposed gambling debts. He ought then, it was said, to have looked for corroboration or be cautious in accepting that evidence. The judge`s finding that the evidence of Lim and Tan was suspect was also attacked. To determine these issues, it was necessary first to examine what approach ought to be taken as regards the evidence of persons with interests to serve.
A number of local cases have identified situations in which some caution or even corroboration is required when the witnesses concerned have interests of their own to serve. One of these is 
 Teo Thin Chan & Anor v PP 
 
 
[1957] MLJ 184
 , in which it was held that the evidence of the mother of the complainant ought not be accepted without supporting evidence. In 
 Tan Kheng Ann & Ors v PP 
 
 
 
[1965] 2 MLJ 108
 , fellow prisoners of the accused, who were charged with murder, gave evidence. The direction to the jury contained the warning that conviction upon that evidence would be dangerous unless its truth was absolutely convicting. The Federal Court, on appeal from Singapore, upheld that direction. Subsequently, Raja Azlan Shah in 
 Lim Boon San v PP 
 
 
 
[1968] 2 MLJ 45
  said that as regards a witness with a purpose of his own to serve, the judge would have to be wary of convicting on uncorroborated evidence. In 
Ng Kum Peng v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 231
  this issue was noted but not gone into.
Most of the cases were decided before the amendments removing the need for corroboration of accomplice evidence were passed. This is an important consideration since the approach in these cases mirrored that for accomplice evidence.
Some guidance may be obtained from the law on accomplice evidence. The person with an interest to serve is in many ways akin to an accomplice - the latter too has his own interest to protect, that is, the lessening of his involvement in the crime. In relation to accomplice evidence, s 135 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) states: 
 
An accomplice shall be a competent witness against an accused person; and any rule of law or practice whereby at a trial it is obligatory for the court to warn itself about convicting the accused on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice is hereby abrogated.
 
 
 
Section 116 reads: 
 
The court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct, and public and private business, in their relation to the facts of the particular case.
 
 
 
Illustrations
 
 
 
The Court may presume -
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
 
(b) that an accomplice is unworthy of credit and his evidence needs to be treated with caution; 
 
...
  
 
 
There is thus no requirement at present for any corroboration warning, but the evidence of an accomplice may, and indeed, generally would, be treated with caution. In light of the removal of the corroboration warning for accomplice evidence, it is not necessary either for the judge to administer himself a similar warning as regards the evidence of a person with an interest to serve, in contrast to the present position as to the evidence of victims of sexual offences and children.
It is open for the judge to so treat the evidence of an interested person with caution, but this is not a general rule. Whether caution is in fact required is very much dependent on the facts of the case. No purpose would be served by the laying down of a rigid rule. Witnesses such as relatives, or persons in an antagonistic relationship with the accused, do not necessarily attract the same caution. The purpose to be served by giving unreliable evidence has to be shown to be particularly strong before such a witness can be regarded as tainted. It is for the trial judge, upon considering the circumstances of the case, to decide whether a particular witness warrants that additional care.
So long as it is apparent that the trial judge has not accepted the evidence of witnesses akin to accomplices wholesale without scrutiny, an appellate court would be slow to interfere with his findings of fact, or his preference for one witness`s testimony over that of another.
 The evidence of Chong and Ling 
Turning now to the specific contention of the appellant, it was said that the trial judge had erred in not considering that the debtors had purposes of their own to serve. In support he cited 
 Lim Boon San v PP 
.
The judge noted that the debtors were not without blemish. He indicated therefore that he knew that the evidence of these witnesses could not be accepted without scrutiny. In any event, the circumstances of this appeal do not justify such caution as argued for by the appellant. Contrary to his contention, the avoidance of a payment of money is not such a strong motive for giving contrary evidence. Indeed, the assault alleged in 
 Ng Kum Peng 
 which the appellant sought to distinguish, would be a stronger reason for giving false evidence than the mere avoidance of payment of money. An allegation of non-payment of a wager could be easily made by any illegal moneylender.
 Acquaintanceship of Lim, Tan and the appellant 
There is no rule of law that acquaintanceship with a party to a proceeding always attracts the need for caution. The judge in giving weight to the length of their acquaintanceship must have taken that into consideration alongside the other observations he would have been able to make about their credit and veracity. It would be wrong to say that the judge had in fact decided to apply anything similar to the principle in 
 Lim Boon San 
; he was merely exercising his judgement based on a number of observations, one of which would have been the length of their acquaintanceship. He did not place undue weight on it.
Furthermore, the judge did not reject the evidence of Tan and Lim simply because they were acquaintances of the appellant - he noted that there were some incongruities in the evidence given by the two, which pointed to what was described by the judge as a taint in favour of the appellant. These will be examined in the following section.
 Preference for the prosecution evidence 
The judge preferred the evidence of the prosecution witnesses. He found that their evidence was `forthright, did not appear fabricated and [the witnesses] gave details of the various transactions involved,`. He noted that Ling had testified that the sums he had borrowed were in two tranches, with different interest and repayment rates. The judge thought that this was all too elaborate for it to be a fabrication. With respect, this is not a forceful consideration - it is conceivable that Ling would have had some experience of other illegal loans, and would have known about the loan terms of illegal moneylenders.
The judge also considered it material that the appellant`s case was not put to either Chong or Ling. This pertained to the fact that the debts were in fact gambling debts incurred at one sitting, and that the loan to Ling was not $43,000, the total of the three charges involving Ling, but only $15,000. While the failure to put a case may imply the acceptance of the opposing case (
 R v Fenlon 
 (1980) 71 Cr App R 307), it must be noted that this is not the invariable consequence. In any event, the appellant`s counsel did put the case that the debts were incurred in gambling. In relation to Chong, the cross-examination was as follows: 
 
Q: Likewise when the [appellant] won his bets when he was the banker you did not pay him but said that you would owe him the money?
A: No.
 
 
 
As for Ling: 
 
Q: When you lost the bet with the accused, you told him that you owed him the money?
 
 
 
 
A: No. I did not gamble with him. 
 
Q: Likewise when the [appellant] played banker and you lost you did not pay the [appellant] but told him that you owed him the money? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: At the end of this gambling session you owed the [appellant] $15,000? 
 
A: No 
 
Q: Put: That you promised to repay the [appellant] the next day? 
 
A: No.
  
 
 
Based on the above, the appellant`s case was adequately, though barely, put to the prosecution witnesses.
Nonetheless, the judge was entitled to find that the evidence of the prosecution witnesses was credible and ought to be preferred - he had the opportunity to observe the witnesses, and make his own assessment of their credibility and credit.
There was some evidence of the appellant being abroad during the period of the alleged offences. This would have put into doubt the statement of the debtors that they had been able to make daily payments everyday during the period that the appellant was away. However, this did not adversely affect the prosecution evidence for the witnesses had only given approximate dates of the taking out of the loans and repayment so it was still possible for those payments to have been made.
The two witnesses for the defence will next be dealt with. A couple of incongruities were noted by the judge. The first incongruity related to the point of time when Chong and Ling had supposedly arranged for repayment the day after the game - the appellant`s case was that this was only done at the end, but his witness, Lim, who had supposedly left before then, appeared to have testified to have personal knowledge of that. The other inconsistency was of a similar nature. Tan had testified that she had left the den before the game had ended, which the judge considered odd since she was supposedly a worker there. The explanation given by Tan that she had stopped working for the operators by then, and that she was only delivering something, appeared to the judge to be an afterthought.
As regards Tan, her testimony need not be interpreted in the manner of the judge. In cross-examination, she had testified as follows: 
 
Q: Did you know how much [Chong] and [Ling] owed the [appellant] after the last gambling session?
 
 
 
 
A: I do not know. 
 
Q: You were there until the den closed? 
 
A: No. I left home before the session ended. 
 
Q: The following day did you go back to work? 
 
A: In fact when I went to Balestier on that occasion I no longer worked for them. The purpose of visit on that occasion was to send a refrigerator to them at the gambling den.
  
 
 
Her explanation then was not so much an explanation of her leaving early, but of the fact that she had not gone back the next day. If so, this was not an afterthought on her part.
The evidence of Lim was however indeed suspect. She had testified: 
 
This session started in early afternoon and I left at about 9pm to 10pm. The session was still going on. The [appellant, Chong and Ling] were still there.
 
 
 
...
In the course of the game they lost very heavy. They used rubber and told the [appellant] that they would pay him tomorrow.
But the appellant had testified: 
 
In October 1994, we gambled for about four to five hours. At the end of the gambling session, [Chong] owed me $10,000. [Ling] owed me $15,000. At first during the game, [Chong and Ling] told me that they would pay me at the end of the game but at the end of the game they told me they did not have funds and asked me to allow them to pay the next day.
 
 
 
There was thus a direct contradiction between Lim`s and the appellant`s evidence. In view of this, both testimonies were suspect, and, on this basis alone, the judge would have been entitled to reject their evidence.
As for the appellant himself, the judge found that his evidence was fabricated. The judge was led to this conclusion as he found it odd that Chong and Ling could pay up to the others but not the appellant; furthermore, the appellant hardly knew the debtors and got no acknowledgement or particulars from them; and the arrangements for repayment appeared all too uncertain. Of the three reasons identified, the latter two would appear to have some force. The appellant said that he considered the two debtors to be in a different category from most other debtors, but, notwithstanding that, it was still suspicious that all the arrangements were so scanty and uncertain. The appellant`s evidence was not convincing, and did not raise a reasonable doubt on the prosecution`s case.
However, as regards the finding that it was odd that Chong and Ling could pay off other players but not the appellant, there was not much weight that could be attached to this - the evidence was that the appellant wagered large amounts, and it was conceivable that the other players would not have wagered, and therefore won, similar large amounts. If so, it was possible that Chong and Ling would have been able to pay off the others. Lim had testified that the average bet was $500, with the least being about $100.
The conclusion was, therefore, that the judge was justified in coming to the conclusion that the evidence of Chong and Ling was to be preferred to that of the appellant, Tan and Lim.
Turning to the evidence of Goh and Khoo, these witnesses were adamant that they had been visited on two occasions each by the appellant, or at least a person who identified himself as `Ah Long`, which name was testified to have been used on at least one occasion by the appellant before both Goh and Khoo. The judge was entitled to prefer their evidence to that of the appellant.
 Whether the visit to Goh`s flat was harassment 
The appellant contended that the judge was wrong in finding that a visit at 11pm constituted harassment. The judge had noted: 
 
In any case the time of the visit, be it 11pm or 1am, clearly implied an intention to harass [Chong] and those living at her flat.
 
 
 
There is no definition of `harassment` in the Moneylender`s Act. Neither is there any judicial definition of the term. 
 The New Shorter Oxford 
 defines the verb `harass` as: 
 
Trouble by repeated attacks. Now freq, subject to constant molesting or persecution.
 
 
 
There is a necessary quality of repetition or persistency. The notion of harassment has to be contrasted with that of intimidation - the latter undoubtedly could include an isolated act; the juxtaposition implies therefore that the normal use of the term harassment has to be preserved. This interpretation is consistent with the decision of this court in 
PP v Tan Poh Heng
 
 
[1995] 1 SLR 518
  , in which the appellant had visited the home of the debtor, and subsequently made a number of telephone calls. There was an attempt to persuade this court that a single visit could not amount to harassment. But it was found that that visit could not be isolated from a series of phone calls. It was stated at p 520: 
 
Both the visit and the telephone calls were part of a threatening course of conduct which had as its aim the demand for repayment of the debt due from the complainant`s husband and which caused alarm and distress to the complainant. In the circumstances I did not see how it could sensibly be said that there was doubt as to whether the respondent had `harassed` the complainant.
 
 
 
It must be noted that a single visit or encounter could undoubtedly amount to harassment if its intensity amounts to a persistent attack or persecution. Thus, if a loan shark were to make a single visit to a recalcitrant debtor, and remained at his door for several hours, that could amount to harassment. On the other hand, it is doubtful that a single visit of a short duration, albeit at a late hour, is sufficient to amount to harassment.
However, it could amount to an implied form of intimidation, which is the other act caught by s 33 of the Moneylenders Act. On the facts, in relation to Goh, the evidence is that there was use of vulgar language during the first visit to his flat, which would support the conclusion that there was some form of intimidation. Though the charge was one of harassment, an amendment to one of intimidation would not have caused any prejudice.
The second visit to Goh, on the other hand, did not disclose anything that would support a finding of either harassment or intimidation. It must be noted that the sixth charge against the appellant, which dealt with the second visit, stated that harassment was committed in that Goh was told to get Chong to pay up, otherwise Goh would have to settle the debt himself. This could fall within the ambit of acts of intimidation, but it would seem that that charge is not supported on the facts at all. Goh said in his examination-in-chief: 
 
On 8 February 1995 at about 1.30am, I was praying outside my unit. The [appellant] came up to my unit with another male Chinese. He identified himself as `Ah Long`. The [appellant] asked me about the whereabouts of my wife. My wife was sleeping in the flat. I was in the midst of praying and did not like being interrupted. I told the [appellant] that my wife was not at home. They told me to relay the message to my wife asking her to contact the [appellant] within three days. That was all he said. The [appellant] did not warn of any consequences if the money was not paid.
 
 
 
In fact, it was during the first visit that Goh was told to settle for his wife. Nothing in the evidence given by Goh would support the facts alleged in the charge.
An act of harassment could be made out if the second visit was taken together with the graffiti drawn at the landing, but no evidence was apparently adduced of the latter, save that Chong had come across it sometime in January 1995. In fact there was no evidence before the court that the graffiti on that occasion was caused by the appellant. Neither was it linked to him. The sixth charge was, therefore, not proven against the appellant.
As for the visits to Khoo, while neither of them constituted harassment, taken individually, they were sufficient acts of intimidation. The first visit to Khoo took place at 1am, with the appellant shouting loudly. A visit at such a time can only be taken generally to be calculated to intimidate the debtor or his family. Similarly, the cryptic remark of the appellant during the second visit, that if the debt was not repaid it would remain forever, would also in the circumstances have to be construed as calculated to intimidate as well. Again, no prejudice would have occurred if the charges were amended.
Following the recent Court of Appeal decision in 
Garmaz s/o Parkhar v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 401
  , it was open to this court to substitute under s 173 of the Criminal Procedure Code a conviction of intimidation for one of harassment. This was accordingly ordered to the 5th, 6th, 10th and 11th charges. The sixth charge, however, was not proven on the facts.
 Failure to call witnesses 
Counsel for the appellant raised a point that the prosecution did not call as witnesses other gamblers who were present to support their case that the appellant had visited Chong at least at the dens to get repayment of the various loans. He relied on s 116, illustration (g) of the Evidence Act which reads: 
 
The court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct, and public and private business, in their relation to the facts of the particular case.
 
 
 
Illustrations
 
 
 
The court may presume -
 
 
 
(g) that evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced be unfavourable to the person who withholds it.
 
 
 
The appellant`s contention was that the failure of the prosecution to adduce the evidence of those other gamblers meant that the court could presume that the evidence would have gone against the prosecution, that is that there were no such visits.
Such arguments are commonly made. Commonly too, such arguments are without merit. The court must hesitate to draw any such presumption unless the witness not produced is essential to the prosecution`s case. Any criminal transaction may be observed by a number of witnesses. It is not necessary for the prosecution to produce every single one of those witnesses. All the prosecution need do is to produce witnesses whose evidence can be believed so as to establish the case beyond a reasonable doubt. Out of a number of witnesses, it may then only be necessary to bring in one or two; as long as those witnesses actually produced are able to give evidence of the transaction, there is no reason why all of the rest should be called, nor why any presumption should be drawn that the evidence of those witnesses not produced would have been against the prosecution. Where the witnesses not produced are not material, no presumption operates against the prosecution (
 Lahvinder Singh v State 
 [1988] Cri LJ 319). Neither would s 116 illustration (g) apply where the evidence to be given is largely redundant (
 Waisuddin v State 
[1991] Cri LJ 134). It was not shown that, in this appeal, the evidence of the witnesses not called was not immaterial or redundant.
It must be emphasized that s 116 illustration (g) is not mandatory. That provision merely states that the court may draw a presumption, not that it must. In determining whether or not that presumption ought to be drawn the court will have regard to all the circumstances, but particularly and importantly the materiality of the witnesses not produced. The adoption of any other approach would be to encourage the adducing of unnecessary evidence, prolonging the trial and confusing the issues.
The question that arises here is distinct from the question of whether the prosecution exercised its discretion correctly in not calling various witnesses for the prosecution. The latter was not raised in this appeal, but in view of the constant confusion between the two, it is necessary to deal with this point briefly. A number of English, Australian and Malaysian authorities have dealt with the duty of the prosecution to call witnesses. It has been thought that the failure to call witnesses may in some circumstances amount to a miscarriage of justice. This is a question of procedural fairness and justice. It has no evidentiary effect. The presumption under s 116 is evidentiary in nature - a set of facts is taken to be true upon the failure to produce a particular witness. Thus, while both the presumption and the prosecution`s duty are concerned with the same situation, the non-production of a witness, they are separate consequences. A miscarriage of justice may arise in a situation in which no presumption can be drawn; a presumption may be drawn in a situation that does not qualify as a miscarriage of justice.
The Court of Appeal in 
Lim Young Sien v PP
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 257
  , in discussing s 116(g) had the opportunity to give its view on the duty of the prosecution. It was said at p 266: 
 
In our judgment, the law is well settled that, in a criminal case, the prosecution has a discretion whether or not to call a particular witness, provided that there is no ulterior motive, and the witness, who is available to, but not called by, the prosecution, is offered to the defence.
 
 
 
The discretion conferred upon the prosecution cannot be fettered by any obligation to call a particular witness. What the prosecution has to do is to prove its case. It is not obliged to go out of its way to allow the defence any opportunity to test its evidence. It is not obliged to act for the defence. Only if there is an intention to hinder or hamper the defence would the possibility of a miscarriage of justice arise, requiring interference by the courts.
 Sentence 
Section 8(1)(b) has been reproduced above. The judge fined the appellant $12,000 on each of the loans made to Chong and between $15,000 and $20,000 on the loans made to Ling. The judge thought that it was necessary to strip the appellant of the gains from the moneylending. In 
 Ng Kum Peng 
, this court stated that it was necessary to protect persons from either threats of assault by illegal moneylenders or the very activity of moneylending. In that case, the trial judge had imposed the then maximum sentence of $5,000 on each of three charges of illegal loans of $3,000. That sentence was not varied on appeal. Taking those fines into account, and the increased limits, the fines imposed in the present case were not manifestly excessive.
As regards the fines imposed for harassment, $5,000 was imposed in each instance. In 
 PP v Tan Poh Heng 
 , the fine was raised from $8,000 to $12,000. In view of that, again the fines imposed were not manifestly excessive and therefore were upheld.
 Conclusion 
The convictions were correct on ten of the charges. Neither were the fines imposed manifestly excessive. The word `intimidate` was substituted for the word `harass` in DAC 4735/95, DAC 4736/95, DAC 4740/95 and DAC 4741/95. The appeal as to conviction and sentence on charges DAC 4731/95 to DAC 4735/95 and DAC 4736/95 to DAC 4741/95 was dismissed, while the appeal as to charge DAC 4736/95 was allowed, and the fine ordered to be returned to the appellant.
