This appeal concerns what is believed to be the largest confiscation orders ever made 
 
-  two  orders  each  in  the  same  sum  of  £92,333,667.    The  confiscation  proceedings 
were  governed  by  the  Criminal  Justice  Act  1988.  Leave  was  granted  by  the  Full 
 
 
Court. 

The  appeal  concerns  two  principal  issues.  The  first  issue  relates  to  benefit  and  the 
 
meaning of the words in “in connection with its commission” in section 71(4) which 
states that “a person benefits from an offence if he obtains property as a result of or in 
connection with its commission”. Similar language is to be found in section 76(4) of 
the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, which provides: “A person benefits from conduct if 
 
he obtains property as a result of or in connection with the conduct”. 

The second issue relates to realisable assets and the consequence of a conclusion that 
a defendant has hidden assets. 

 

The statutory assumptions in section 72AA did not apply. 

 

The  judge,  Flaux  J,  found  that  the  prosecution  had  proved  on  the  balance  of 
probabilities that each appellant had benefited in the sum of some £72 million uplifted 
 
for changes in the value of money due to inflation to £92,333,667 being the sum that 
 
had passed through bank accounts under their control in furtherance of what was a 
 
massive carousel fraud1. The judge also found that they had not proved on the balance 
   
of probabilities that they did not have realisable assets in that sum. 

 
None of the money has been paid and any sum eventually realised is likely to be far 
 
less than the £184,667,334 owed. The unpaid sum is presumably represented in the 
 
reported £1.26 billion of unpaid confiscation orders shown as an asset in the accounts 
of the Ministry of Justice2 and for which the Minister has received public blame (see 
e.g.  The  Sun  23/11/2011  under  the  headline  “SOFT  JUSTICE  SCANDAL”  “YOU 
 
KEN NOT BE SERIOUS” and 24/11/2011, under the headline “KEN FINES RAP”). 

 

 
Both  appellants  claim  that  they  have  no  realisable  assets,  a  claim  which  was 
unsurprisingly rejected by Flaux J in a very careful and necessarily lengthy judgment. 
He  described  the  appellants  as  unscrupulous  and  deeply  mendacious,  particularly 
about their assets. The evidence that the appellants gave to the effect that they were 
penniless  was  described  by  the  judge  as  “frankly  ludicrous”.  In  so  far  as  revealing 
their  assets  the  appellants  were  “complete  liars”.  Both  appellants  were  very 

 

 

 

 

 

                                                 
1 The Sentencing Guidelines Council Guidelines – Sentencing for Fraud Statutory Offences defines MT Missing 
 
trader intra-community fraud (“MTIC”) and Carousel frauds in this way:  MTIC Frauds involve traders 
importing goods from the European Union free from VAT, charging VAT when they sell the goods and then 
keeping the money rather than paying it to HMRC. Carousel Frauds are MTIC Frauds where the trader sells the 
 
goods to another trader who re-exports them and claims back the VAT paid to the first trader from HMRC. 
Usually the goods are passed along a chain of traders between the missing trader and the broker known as 
‘buffers’, in order to disguise the fraudulent nature of the activity. Having been exported by the broker, the 
goods are typically re-imported by the missing trader and pass through the same circle of transactions again and 
 
again in rapid succession.

uncooperative  throughout  the  confiscation  proceedings.  The  judge  comprehensively 
rejected submissions that the confiscation proceedings were an abuse of process. He 
 
was fully entitled to reach all of these conclusions. 

Background 

On 28th March 2007 in the Crown Court at Northampton (H.H.J. Alexander Q.C. and 
a jury) the appellants were each convicted of conspiracy to cheat the public revenue 
(count  1).  On  30th  March  2007  before  the  same  constitution,  they  were  each 
 
sentenced  to  seven  years’  imprisonment.  Each  was  disqualified  from  acting  as  a 
company  director  for  12  years  under  section  2  of  the  Company  Directors 
Disqualification Act 1986. To avoid confusion, the appellant Ahmad will be referred 
   
to as Shakeel and the appellant Ahmed as Syed. 

On  11th  June  2007  in  the  Court  of  Appeal  Criminal  Division  Shakeel’s  renewed 
application  for  leave  to  appeal  against  conviction  was  refused.    His  renewed 
applications for leave to appeal sentence and for an extension of time (two weeks and 
 
three days) were adjourned. On the same date Syed’s renewed conviction application 
was abandoned with the leave of the Court and his renewed application for leave to 
appeal sentence was refused. 

On  31st  October  2008  the  Court  of  Appeal  Criminal  Division  granted  Shakeel  the 
 
 
appropriate extension of time and leave to appeal sentence.  The appeal was refused. 

On 5th July 2010 in the Crown Court at Leicester Flaux J, after a hearing which had 
lasted 31 days, gave a 110 page judgment in which he made a confiscation order (in 
identical terms for each appellant) under s.71 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 in the 
sum of £92,333,667 to be paid within two months and in default to serve ten years’ 
 
imprisonment  consecutive  to  the  sentence  for  the  substantive  offence.  Having 
dispensed with his counsel Shakeel ultimately represented himself at the confiscation 
 
proceedings and Syed was ultimately represented under a representation order by Mr 
Ken  Berry,  an  ex-police  officer  with  no  legal  qualifications  employed  by  Burton 
Copeland Solicitors. This made the judge’s task even more difficult than it already 
 
was. 

 

On 16th June 2011 the full Court granted the appellants leave to appeal against the 
 
confiscation order on grounds relating to the benefit and realisable assets and referred 
to  the  Court  the  application  for  leave  to  appeal  the  order  that  in  the  event  of  non-
payment of the total amount within two months, the 10 years’ term of imprisonment 
would  have  to  be  served  consecutively.  The  period  of  two  months  was  not  chosen 
because it was realistically expected that the full amount could be paid in that time but 
 
because it was feared that the appellants might abscond if released on licence. 

Sir  Derek  Spencer  QC  submits,  emphatically,  that  the  confiscation  orders  made  by 
Flaux J were the orders which he was required to make by virtue of the confiscation 
legislation  and  that  the  result  corresponds  to  the  intention  of  Parliament  in  passing 
that legislation. Mr Tedd QC disagrees.

The facts- a broad overview 

Ahmad & Ahmed 

 
14.

16.	 

 
17.	 

The appellants were directors and shareholders (Syed 51% and Shakeel 49%) of MST 
(Associates)  Limited  (hereafter  “MST”)  which  was  incorporated  in  1997  and 
registered for VAT. It operated as a computer parts broker dealing mainly with central 
processing  units  (CPU’s).  The  conspiracy  concerned  32  transactions  which  took 
place  between  13th  and  30th  April  2002,  MST  acting  as  a  second  line  ‘buffer’ 
company. Unsurprisingly the judge held that MST had engaged in no lawful trade and 
“pierced the corporate veil”. 

The fraud involved five companies in Ireland purporting to export large quantities of 
 
CPU’s to a “missing trader” (five in total) in the UK.  The goods were zero rated on 
import  to  the  UK.  The  missing  trader  was  either  a  registered  company  which  went 
“missing” or a genuine company the identity of which was hijacked by the fraudsters. 

The  missing  trader  then  ostensibly  sold  the  goods  to  GW224,  the  first  line  buffer 
 
company which then sold the goods to MST.  

GW224 was an apparently genuine company interposed to make it more difficult for 
 
the authorities to identify the fraud.  On paper the missing trader sold the goods to 
GW224 at a loss enabling everyone else in the supply chain ostensibly to sell on at a 
profit. The missing trader issued a VAT invoice to GW224 enabling it to deduct the 
 
amount shown as VAT as input tax from the amount due from GW224 to Customs in 
respect  of  output  tax  on  the  onwards  sale  to  MST,  a  second  line  buffer  company. 
Notwithstanding  that  GW224  was  purporting  to  sell  the  goods  to  MST,  on  nine 
occasions MST paid the company in Ireland directly thus by-passing GW224. 

 

 

18.	  MST  then  sold  the  goods  on  to  an  exporting  company,  usually  Harringtons,  for  an 
amount which included VAT. The exporting company then exported the goods back 
to the company in Ireland which had originally sold the goods.  In many cases the 
whole chain of transactions took place on the same day.  

 
19.	 

No VAT was payable on the export. The exporter however then reclaimed the VAT 
 
which it had paid to MST.  The amount of the VAT which was fraudulently reclaimed 
by the exporter was £12,662,822 (which we shall call for convenience £12.6 million). 
If the transactions had been genuine and there had been no missing trader then there 
would have been no loss to HMRC.  The  fraudulently obtained £12.6 million was 
used to fuel the fraud or laundered through various accounts and withdrawn in cash or 
 
used to buy gold bullion, none of which could be traced. 

The benefit 
 

The judge having pierced the corporate veil held that the benefit obtained by MST 
was the benefit of the appellants and, following now well-established authority, that 
the  benefit  for  each  appellant  was  therefore  the  amount  of  the  benefit  obtained  by 
 
MST.  He was right to pierce the corporate veil. 

It is undisputed (on the law as it now stands) that where a benefit is obtained jointly, 
each of the joint beneficiaries has obtained the whole of the benefit and may properly 
be ordered to pay a sum equivalent to the whole of it. See R. v. May [2008] 1 AC

1028, para. 43. This is subject to one possible exception which Lord Bingham referred 
to in paragraph 45: 

“There  might  be  circumstances  in  which  orders  for  the  full 
amount  against  several  defendants  might  be  disproportionate 
and contrary to article 1 of the First Protocol, and in such cases 
an apportionment approach might be adopted, but that was not 
the situation here and the total of the confiscation orders made 
 
by the judge fell well below the sum of which the Revenue had 
been cheated.” 

 
22.	 

The  total  amount  of  VAT  loss  to  HMRC  on  the  32  MST  transactions  was  £12.6 
million. On the judge’s findings the appellants obtained that amount as result of the 
commission of the offence. That was not the appellants’ profit, but the confiscation 
legislation is not concerned at the benefit stage with profit, although the amount of the 
profit may well be relevant when considering a person’s realisable assets. The judge 
 
said that about the £12.6 million (para. 6): 

“[It]  was  divided,  part  of  it  being  used  to  discount  the  sales 
through  the  carousel  and  part  of  it  laundered  into  so-called 
cashing-up accounts of entities which were not concerned with 
the carousel transactions but which allowed their accounts to be 
used  for  these  purposes.  The  money  which  went  into  these 
accounts  was  withdrawn  in  cash  or  used  to  buy  gold  bullion, 
neither of which could be traced.”

26.	 

 
27.	 

On the face of the accounts of the buffer companies, the “profit” is, as we understand 
 
it, usually in the region of between 1 and 2% of the VAT of which HMRC is to be 
defrauded. However, such was the role of MST and the appellants in the fraud, the 
benefit represented the total loss to the HMRC on the 32 transactions, that loss being 
property obtained by the principal conspirators as a result of the commission of the 
offence.3 
 

The  appellants,  at  an  earlier  stage  of  the  proceedings  and  whilst  represented,  had 
accepted £12.6 million as the benefit. Later they resiled from that position and argued 
that the benefit was only £1.3 million. Mr Tedd QC accepted the correctness of the 
figure of £12.6 million.  He was, in our view, right to do so. 
 

In the light of May, each appellant had benefited in the sum of £12.6 million, subject 
 
to the possible exception identified in paragraph 21 above, an exception which seems 
 
unlikely to apply in this case given the difficulty of obtaining any money from the 
appellants. 

Stopping  at  this  point  the  benefit  figure  would  have  been  £12.6  million  for  each 
appellant. 

In the past many judges would have stopped at this point and have treated the VAT, 
which HMRC has paid out as a result of the fraud, as the only benefit. In this case 

                                                 
3 It does not follow from the fact that a person is a conspirator that conspirator is to be taken as having jointly 
 
obtained the whole benefit obtained by ""the conspiracy"": see e.g. Allpress [2009] 2 Cr App Rep (S) 58. para. 31.

Ahmad & Ahmed 

Flaux J took a different view. He held that the benefit was the total amount of money 
which  had  passed  through  the  MST  bank  accounts  in  furtherance  of  the  fraud, 
concluding that that was property obtained in connection with the commission of the 
 
offence.  To commit an MTIC fraud it is, as the judge found, a necessary part of the 
 
deception on HMRC that an amount representing the value of the goods and the VAT 
thereon should pass through the accounts of the buffer companies.  

 
28.	 

Thus, in so far as benefit is concerned, the appeal therefore concerns the meaning of 
“in connection with the commission of the offence”. Mr Tedd argues that an over wide 
interpretation should not be given to these words.  

Obtains property in connection with the commission of the offence 

 

29.	  We give a number of examples of the issues raised by these words, assuming that D 
buys 10,000 genuine cigarettes for £1,000 in Belgium, smuggles them into England 
and sells them wholesale for £1,200, the retail price being £3,500. Let us assume that 
 
no  statutory  assumptions  apply.    He  is  convicted  of  cheating  the  Revenue  of  the 
excise duty and VAT. His benefit is certainly £1,200 (he obtained £1,200 as a result 
of the commission of the offence) and he cannot offset the costs, e.g. of the purchase 
of the cigarettes and of the transport. In addition he has, on the authorities, obtained a 
pecuniary advantage, namely the evaded duty, which we shall assume to be £1000,4 
 
and  the  evaded  acquisition  VAT  which  we  shall  assume  to  be  £400.  His  benefit  is 
 
therefore £2,600.  If the cigarettes which he bought in Belgium can be said to have 
been  obtained  “in  connection  with  the  offence”  then  the  value  of  those  cigarettes 
would also form part of the benefit. That would be a further £1,000, in the light of 
section 74(6)).  Thus not only is D unable to deduct the costs, but a significant part of 
those costs would be added to make up the benefit figure.  D’s benefit for a fraud that 
cost the Revenue £1,400, would be £3,600. 

 
30.	 

To  take  another  example,  again  assuming  no  statutory  assumptions  apply.  D  is 
convicted of cultivating cannabis and supplying it.  He has sold cannabis which he has 
 
cultivated for £100,000.  He has obtained that as a result of the commission of the 
offence and that is certainly a benefit.  To cultivate that amount of cannabis he has 
had to buy equipment to the value of say £30,000. If he obtained the equipment “in 
connection with the commission of the offence” for the purposes of section 71(4), then 
his benefit would increase by £30,000.  His benefit would then be increased by the 
value of at least some of the costs which he had incurred. As to expenditure on such 
things as wages and rent, see James, discussed below. 

 

 
31.	  Whilst these two examples may not, on the face of it, seem similar to the facts of this 
case,  they  are  in  fact  similar.  In  a  carousel  fraud  the  conspirators  have  to  put  up  a 
 
significantly  large  sum  of  money  to  “prime  the  pump”.    That  money  then  passes 
through the accounts of the buffer companies. As we have said, to commit an MTIC 
fraud, it is a necessary part of the deception on HMRC that an amount representing 
the value of the goods and the VAT thereon should pass through the accounts of the 
buffer companies.  The fact that money has to be put up to prime the pump is part of 
 
the cost of committing the fraud.  It may well be that the money used to prime the 
 
pump  is  itself  a  benefit  from  earlier  VAT  or  other  frauds  but  that  would  only  be 

                                                 
4 The evaded duty is calculated from the retail price.

relevant in the calculation of the benefit if statutory assumptions apply, which they 
did not in this case. 

 

32.	  We add that, during the course of argument, we were concerned by the fact that it may 
have effectively been the “same money” passing through the accounts in each of the 
32 transactions.  Whilst the profit (the VAT of which HMRC was being cheated) was 
 
being siphoned off, it seemed to us likely that the money used to prime the pump was 
 
effectively the same money and that therefore the figure of £72 million was wrong for 
 
that reason.  In the light of our decision it is not necessary to resolve that issue. If we 
had  decided  that  the  figure  of  £72  million  was  wrong  or  probably  wrong  for  this 
reason, we would have sent this issue back to Flaux J.  

 
33.	 

It would, in our view, be surprising if Parliament intended the costs of committing an 
offence to form part of the benefit of the offence.  In Crown Prosecution Service v. 
Jennings    [2008]  1  AC  1046,  Lord  Bingham  giving  the  considered  view  of  the 
 
Committee said: 

“13. ... It is, however, relevant to remember that the object of 
the legislation is to deprive the defendant of the product of his 
crime  or  its  equivalent,  not  to  operate  by  way  of  fine.  The 
rationale  of  the  confiscation  regime  is  that  the  defendant  is 
 
deprived  of  what  he  has  gained  or  its  equivalent.  He  cannot, 
and should not, be deprived of what he has never obtained or its 
equivalent, because that is a fine.” (Emphasis added) 

 
34.	 

In R v Olubitan [2004] 2 Cr App R(S) 14, May LJ said, at page 78: 

“The section [section 71(1A) of the 1988 Act, the precursor to s 6 of POCA] is 
not to be construed so that a person may be held to have obtained property or 
derived a pecuniary advantage when a proper view of the evidence 
demonstrates that he has not in fact done so.” 

This  passage  was  cited  with  apparent  approval  by  the  House  of  Lords  in  May,  at 
paragraph 19. 

To  make  a  confiscation  order  which  includes  within  the  benefit  the  costs  of 
 
committing a crime seems to be contrary to the object of the legislation and that part 
 
of the confiscation order would, it seems to us, to operate by way of a fine.  

 

It is noteworthy that in one of the leading cases it was never suggested that the costs 
 
of purchasing the smuggled cigarettes was part of the benefit.  In R v Smith [2002] 1 
Cr App R 35; [2002] 1 WLR 54 Smith  the facts were as follows.  Smith bought a 
motor vessel, The Vertine, with £55,000 provided by his co-defendant, John Marriott. 
In the words of the judge when imposing sentence, the respondent allowed himself to 
be used as Marriott's ship owner and captain. The boat was used in April 1998 on a 
run  to  Heligoland  to  buy  cigarettes  and  to  smuggle  them  into  this  country  without 
paying  duty.  On  8  May  1998  the  respondent,  Marriott  and  another  man,  David 
Russell, set sail once more for Heligoland. Two days later, on 10 May, they sailed The 
Vertine,  laden  with  cigarettes,  into  the  Humber  estuary,  past  the  customs  houses  at 
 
Immingham  and  Hull  and  so  on  for  some  50  miles  up  the  River  Ouse  until  she 
reached Ocean Lock at the entrance to Goole. There is no customs house at this point.

Ahmad & Ahmed 

When  the  boat  arrived  at  Goole,  customs  officers  stopped  and  searched  her.  They 
found 1.25 million cigarettes on board. The excise duty payable on that quantity of 
 
cigarettes would have been £130,666.40. The House of Lords held, overturning the 
CACD, that an importer of uncustomed goods, in this case cigarettes, who intends not 
to enter them for customs purposes and not pay any duty on them, derives a benefit 
under  section  74  of  the  Criminal  Justice  Act  1988  through  not  paying  the  required 
duty  at  the  point  of  importation,  where  the  goods  are  forfeited  by  HM  Customs 
 
following importation, before their value can be realised by the importer. We note in 
passing  in  Waya,  UKSC  2010/0088,  which  will  be  re-argued  before  the  Supreme 
 
Court in March, the parties have been sent a note which, amongst other things, asks 
the question: “Did Parliament intend that confiscation proceedings should be brought 
in  respect  of  property  that  has  been  restored  by  or  recovered  from  the  defendant.” 
The note also states that “it may be that the Court should reconsider” whether Smith 
was correctly decided. 

 

 

 

37.	  Whether Smith was or was not correctly decided on the evasion issue, it was never 
suggested  at  any  stage  of  the  proceedings  that  the  1.25  million  cigarettes  found  on 
 
board were property obtained in connection with the commission of the offence. 

 
38.	 

At trial the prosecution claimed and the judge included within the benefit figure was 
 
the  purchase  value  of  The  Vertine  used  for  the  smuggling.  The  Court  of  Appeal 
(Mance  LJ,  Newman  and  Burton  JJ  Friday  16  June  2000  No.  2000/00449/X4) 
 
 
quashed that finding saying: 

 

“36. So far as the second limb is concerned -- that is in relation 
to the £55,000 being the purchase value of the motor vessel --
this  was  hardly  pursued  by  Mr  Newbury  [counsel  for  the 
 
Crown]. It appears clear to us that, quite apart from the issue 
whether it could be a benefit to the appellant ‘as a result of or in 
connection with’ the offence that a boat was purchased in his 
name  to  use  in  the  offence,  the  fact  is  that  any  such  benefit 
which might otherwise have been arguable under the Act was 
not  obtained  by  him,  and  certainly  at  the  date  of  the 
confiscation order he had no such benefit, because of the boat 
itself being forfeited. In those circumstances the entirety of the 
sum which formed the basis of the certified sum, which led on 
to the sum by way of realisable assets which formed the basis 
of the confiscation order, falls away.” 

 
39.	 

The certified question did not concern this conclusion. In the House of Lords Lord 
Rodger said: 

31. In their judgment the Court of Appeal touched only briefly 
on a further issue which ""was hardly pursued"" by counsel for 
 
the Crown in the proceedings before them. This related to the 
value  of  The  Vertine  which  had  been  purchased  in  the 
respondent's  name  with  moneys  provided  by  Marriott.  The 
 
argument for the Crown was that this was property which the 
respondent had obtained in connection with the commission of 
the  offence.  The  Court  of  Appeal  held  that,  even  if  the 
respondent had obtained any such benefit, he no longer had it at

the date of the confiscation order since The Vertine had been 
forfeited. Mr Emmerson did not seek to support this aspect of 
the  reasoning  of  the  Court  of  Appeal,  which  is  plainly 
inconsistent  with  the  terms  of  sections  71(4)  and  74(5).  Not 
surprisingly,  in  view  of  the  lack  of  prominence  given  to  the 
issue before them, the Court of Appeal did not certify it as one 
 
of public importance and the House did not give leave to appeal 
in respect of it. 

32. Nonetheless during the hearing Mr Mitchell argued that the 
respondent  had  obtained  the  boat  in  connection  with  the 
 
commission  of  the  offence  and  that  he  had  accordingly 
benefited  to  the  extent  of  its  value.  Since  I  would  allow  the 
appeal  and  restore  the  confiscation  order  for  £46,250,  which 
exhausts the respondent's realisable assets, this point is entirely 
academic. In these circumstances I would say only this. Even 
on  the  Crown  approach,  it  was  not  entirely  clear,  on  the 
available evidence, what the value of the boat would have been 
to  the  respondent  at  the  time  when  he  obtained  it  (section 
74(5)).  For  that  reason  I  should  not  be  taken  as  necessarily 
accepting  the  Crown's  submission  that  the  respondent  had 
obtained  property  worth  £55,000  to  him  by  virtue  of  the 
transaction involving The Vertine. 

 

40.	  Whilst  therefore  no  concluded  view  was  expressed  about  the  boat,  it  was  not 
suggested  at  any  point  that  the  cost  of  purchasing  the  smuggled  cigarettes  was  a 
 
benefit. 

Although not referred to during the course of argument before us, R. v Waller [2008] 
EWCA Crim 2037 raises the issue whether goods bought in order to commit a crime 
 
are part of the benefit. The appellant was stopped at the Channel Tunnel by British 
customs officers, who found 250 kg of undeclared hand rolling tobacco in the boot of 
his car. The defendant admitted to buying the tobacco for himself, his family and his 
friends. He said that he had spent £2,000 of his own money and £12,000 given to him 
 
by  others.  The  appellant  had  pleaded  guilty  to  being  knowingly  concerned  in  the 
fraudulent  evasion  of  the  duty  payable  on  the  importation  of  250  kilograms  of 
 
tobacco.  In  the  subsequent  confiscation  proceedings  the  Crown  contended  that  the 
defendant's  benefit  amounted  to  £41,505,  being  the  total  of  the  evaded  duty  of 
£27,505 (applying Smith) and £14,000, being the cost of the tobacco. It was held on 
appeal that the judge had rightly decided that the cost of the tobacco was part of the 
benefit,  notwithstanding  that,  at  least  in  every  day  parlance,  the  appellant  had 
obtained no benefit at all and the Revenue, unlike the appellant, had lost nothing and 
indeed had, presumably, confiscated the cigarettes.  

The Court in Waller, in an unreserved judgment, gave six reasons for its conclusion. 
Giving  the  first  reason  Silber  J  relied  upon  passages  in  May  and,  in  particular,  the 
passage which states that a person ordinarily obtains property if in law he owns it, 
whether  alone  or  jointly.  In  our  view  the  fact  that  a  defendant  owned  the  tobacco 
cannot of itself be decisive of the issue of whether the purchase price of the tobacco is 
 
a benefit.

The second reason was expressed in this way: 

Ahmad & Ahmed 

“18. The judge was correct for a second reason which is based 
on comments which were made by Lord Rodger of Earlsferry 
in Cadman Smith case. He said, first, at paragraph 21: 

‘The measure of his benefit is the value of the property so 
 
obtained.’ 

Lord Rodger then went on to say at paragraph 23: 

‘...the courts have consistently held that 'payments' received 
in  connection  with  drug  trafficking  mean  gross  payments 
rather than net profit and that 'proceeds' of drug trafficking 
mean a gross payments rather than net profit after deducting 
  
the cost of the drug trafficking operation.’ 

We accept that these comments relate to the proceeds of drug 
trafficking but, in our view, they are equally applicable to cases 
of evading duty and by analogy to circumstances such as those 
 
in the present appeal where the court is required to assess the 
benefit  of  criminal  conduct  involving  importation  of  goods 
 
In  those  circumstances,  the  court  is  not 
purchased  abroad. 
concerned solely with the duty evaded but, with the total value 
of the property involved. This value must include the purchase 
price of the goods.” 

 
44.	 

 
45.	 

Although the Court relied upon Smith, the fact that no-one suggested in Smith that the 
cigarettes in Smith were part of the benefit is not mentioned. 
 

The third reason relied upon the words “benefit” and “in connection with”. The Court 
 
said: 

“Our  third  reason  for  accepting  the  contentions  of  the 
 
respondent flows from the wording of the statutory provisions 
because  the  court  has  to  ask  itself  two  questions.  The  first  is 
whether the defendant has benefited from his criminal conduct. 
 
In  this  case,  the  answer  must  be  in  the  affirmative,  as  the 
appellant  obtained  tobacco  which  he  purchased.  The  second 
question,  based  on  section  76(4)  is  whether  the  appellant 
obtained  property  ""as  a  result  of  or  in  connection  with""  the 
conduct of evading excise duty.  In this case the answer must 
 
be  that  the  appellant  obtained  property,  namely  the  tobacco. 
This was the only property that he obtained and in reaching that 
conclusion, we have noted the width of the words used in the 
statutory  provision  because  they  talk  about  a  person  who 
obtains  property  ""as  a  result  of  or  in  connection  with  his 
conduct"".  The words ""as a result of"" apply to any consequence, 
while  the  words  ""in  connection  with""  widen  that  meaning.  In 
our  view,  the  acquisition  of  property  and  this  tobacco  falls 
 
clearly within both those categories.”

Ahmad & Ahmed 

 
46.	 

Although the Court in this passage states that the appellant must have benefited from 
the offence, it is difficult to see how it can be said that he benefited other than by 
 
interpreting the words ""in connection with"" to reach that conclusion. 

 
47.	 

 
The fourth and fifth reasons were expressed as follows: 

“20.  The  fourth  reason  why  we  regard  the  respondent's 
 
submissions as being correct is the use of the word ""property"" 
in section 76(4).  It is significant because the focus is not on the 
 
benefit  which  the  appellant  obtained  as  a  result  of  his 
 
smuggling (namely the evasion of duty) but what ""property"" he 
 
received and again, that must be tobacco.  

21.  The  fifth  reason  why  we  agree  with  the  judge  is  that  the 
submission  of  the  appellant  would  mean  that  the  statutory 
provision  has  to  be  re-written  so  that  the  word  ""profit""  is 
 
introduced 
is  not 
permissible  and  we  have  already  stated  that  the  Appellate 
 
Committee in May was saying that the words should be given 
their common sense meaning.” 

the  word  ""property"".  That 

to  define 

 

48.	  With all respect we do not follow these two reasons.  The fact that the tobacco which 
he bought is “property” is, in our view, of little help in resolving the issue. As far as 
“profit” is concerned, it is one thing to say that in determining the benefit, the costs 
 
 
must be ignored and another thing to say that the costs can be added on to the benefit. 

 
49.	 

Giving the sixth reason, Silber J cited a decision from Northern Ireland, in which the 
judge reached the same conclusion as the Court in Waller reached. 

 

50.	  Waller  has  been  the  subject  of  criticism  both  in  Archbold,  para.  5-1051  and  in  the 

 

 
Criminal Law Week, 08/35/30: 

“No sooner did it appear that the Court of Appeal was, at long 
last, prepared to countenance a measure of proportionality in its 
 
approach  to  the  confiscation  legislation  (see  R.  v.  Sivaraman 
 
[2008]  8  Archbold  News  3,  C.A.  (CLW/08/34/19)),  than  it 
takes two steps backwards.  There has been a long and sorry 
history  to  the  Court  of  Appeal’s  treatment  of  this  legislation, 
and this represents a new low. 

 

 

It is worth spelling out the practical effect of the decision.   Had 
the  offender  succeeded  in  smuggling  the  tobacco  into  this 
 
country,  he  would  have  been  in  possession  of  tobacco  for 
which he had paid £14,000 and he would have evaded paying 
  
the duty which he ought to have paid to the tune of £27,505. 
As it was, however, the goods which he had bought for £14,000 
were  forfeited,  he  was  punished  for  the  offence  itself  (18 
 
months’ imprisonment), and he was ordered to pay not only the 
duty notionally evaded (£27,500 - about which there was, and 
could be, no complaint:  R. v. Smith (David) [2002] 1 W.L.R. 
54, H.L. (CLW/01/45/10)) but also the £14,000 which he had

‘proportionate 

already  paid  over  again.    And  this,  the  court  seemingly 
regarded 
response’. 
How  was  it  possible  for  the  Court  of  Appeal  to  arrive  at  this 
conclusion?  It purported to rely on the legislation itself, and 
 
on the decisions of the House of Lords in Smith (David) and R. 
v. May [2008] 2 W.L.R. 1131, H.L. (CLW/08/19/9).  Anybody 
familiar with the Act and with those decisions will be bemused 
as to how they could lead to this result.  As to Smith (David), 
the  allegation  was  an  identical  one  of  smuggling  tobacco.  It 
was held by the House of Lords that the appellant had obtained 
a pecuniary advantage as a result of, or in connection with, his 
offence,  even  though  the  contraband  had  been  recovered  by 
Customs  and  Excise,  the  value  of  the  pecuniary  advantage 
being the amount of duty evaded.  Under the legislation he was 
 
then to be taken to have obtained a sum of money equal to the 
 
value of the pecuniary advantage (see now s.76(5) of the 2002 
Act (Archbold, 2008, § 5-637)).  It was never once suggested 
in  that  case  that  the  appellant  actually  obtained  property  (as 
opposed to being treated as if he had done so), and, certainly, it 
was never once suggested that he obtained the tobacco itself as 
a result of or in connection with the offence (i.e. as “property” 
within  section  71(4)  of  the  Criminal  Justice  Act  1988  (now 
s.76(4)  of  the  2002  Act)).    On  the  contrary,  Lord  Rodger  (at 
p.63A)  contemplated  the  situation  as  it  would  have  been  had 
the appellant and his companions been successful in smuggling 
the  tobacco.    He  said  that  had  they  been  able  to  sell  the 
cigarettes,  ‘then  the  money  which  they  received  from  selling 
them would have been ‘property’ in terms of section 71(4).  In 
that  situation,  they  would  not  only  have  derived  a  pecuniary 
advantage in terms of section 71(5) from evading the duty but 
would also have obtained property in terms of section 71(4) in 
the form of sales receipts.   Their benefit from the commission 
of  the  offence  would  have  been  made  up  of  two  elements.’ 
 
According  to  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  this  case,  however,  the 
benefit  was  made  up  of  two  elements  even  where  the 
contraband  was  seized  before  there  was  any  opportunity  for 
onward sale.   Were there any substance to this proposition, it 
would surely have been made by the House of Lords in Smith 
(David). 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

51.	  We see considerable force in this criticism (albeit that we would not have adopted the 
 

 

 

 
same tone). 

 

The same issue arose in R. v James and another [2011] EWCA Crim 2991 (decided 
after the hearing in this case).  Edwards-Stuart J, giving the judgment of the Court, 
distinguished Waller (albeit saying that the result was unsurprising).   In James the 
 
appellant had bought items to assist the process of converting raw tobacco into hand 
rolling tobacco. The judge had held that the items purchased were part of the benefit 
and that the rent and wages which he had paid were a pecuniary advantage and also 

 

 
52.
--------

Ahmad & Ahmed 

part  of  the  benefit.  The  Court  quashed  that  part  of  the  confiscation  order  which 
encompassed these items. The appellant did not obtain the items in connection with 
 
any criminal conduct. His criminal conduct in participating in the conspiracy formed 
no part of the transactions by which he acquired the various items. Their acquisition 
was  by  way  of  lawful  purchase  for  value.  We  accept  that  these  transactions  were 
entered into for the purpose of criminal conduct, but that is not necessarily a state of 
 
affairs caught by section 76(4). 

In our view there are a number of central flaws in the reasoning in Waller. First, Smith 
 
does not assist the conclusion that the purchased tobacco was part of the benefit and, 
although the Court in Waller did not say this, Smith points very much the other way. 
Secondly,  in  May,  Lord  Bingham  pointed  out  that  if  the  total  of  the  confiscation 
orders made by the judge exceeded the sum of which the Revenue had been cheated, 
 
then  an  issue  of  proportionality  would  arise  (see  para.  21  above).  In  this  case  the 
Revenue was cheated of £12.6 million but the judge made two confiscation orders in 
the sum of £72 million (before uplift). Thirdly we refer to the passages from Jennings 
 
and  Olubitan  which  we  have  already  cited  (paras.  33  and  34  above).  Fourthly,  as 
James  shows,  the  words  “in  connection  with”  must  be  construed    with  the  word 
“benefit” in mind.  To say that in assessing the benefit the Court does not take into 
account the costs incurred by the criminal in committing the offence is very different 
 
from saying that the costs should be added on to the benefit.  The robber’s benefit is 
what  he  steals,  the  robber  cannot  deduct  the  costs  of  undertaking  the  robbery  but 
 
surely those costs should not be added on to the benefit? 

    

In our view Waller was clearly wrong. Are we bound by it? 
 

The principles can be found set out in R v Rowe [2007] EWCA Crim 635; [2007] QB 
 
975 by the then Lord Chief Justice, Lord Phillips: 

“22. Giving the judgment of the court [in R v Simpson [2003] 
EWCA Crim 1499], Lord Woolf CJ started by setting out the 
established  situations  in  which  the  Court  of  Appeal  could 
depart  from  one  of  its  previous  decisions,  as  summarised  in 
Halsbury's Laws of England 4th Ed Vol 37 para 1242: 

 

‘(i)  where  the  Court  has  acted  in  ignorance  of  a  previous 
decision of its own court or a court of coordinate jurisdiction 
which covered the case before it. If this is the case the Court 
must decide which case to follow; 

(ii) where the Court has acted in ignorance of a decision of 
the House of Lords; 

(iii) where the Court has given its decision in ignorance of 
the terms of a statute or a rule having statutory force; or  

(iv)  where  in  exceptional  and  rare  cases,  the  Court  is 
satisfied that there has been a manifest slip or error and there 
is no prospect of an appeal to the House of Lords.’ 

 
53.

Ahmad & Ahmed 

 
None of these was applicable. Lord Woolf then commented at 
paragraph 27: 

‘…the paragraphs in Halsbury should not read as if they are 
contained in a statute. The rules as to precedent reflect the 
practice of the courts and have to be applied bearing in mind 
that  their  objective  is  to  assist  in  the  administration  of 
justice. They are of considerable importance because of their 
role in achieving the appropriate degree of certainty as to the 
 
law.  This  is  an  important  requirement  of  any  system  of 
justice. The principles should not, however, be regarded as 
so  rigid  that  they  cannot  develop  in  order  to  meet 
 
contemporary needs.’ 

 

Lord  Woolf  then  referred  to  two  statements  made  by  Lord 
Diplock. The first, as Diplock LJ in R v Gould [1968] 2 QB 65 
at p. 68 was to the effect that the Criminal Division of the Court 
of Appeal is not rigidly bound by the doctrine of stare decisis. 
The  second,  in  DPP  v  Merriman  [1973]  AC  584  at  p.  685 
stated that the liberty of the Criminal Division to depart from 
 
precedent which it was convinced was erroneous was restricted 
to cases where the departure was in favour of the accused.  

23. Lord Woolf commented:  

‘34.  There  is  nothing  to  suggest  in  Merriman  that  Lord 
 
Diplock  was  reminded  of  what  he  said  in  Gould.  We 
appreciate that there may be a case for not interpreting the 
law contrary to a previous authority in a manner that would 
mean  that  an  offender  who  otherwise  would  not  have 
committed an offence would be held to have committed an 
offence.  However,  we  do  not  understand  why  that  should 
apply  to  a  situation  where  a  defendant,  as  here,  wishes  to 
rely  upon  a  wrongly  decided  case  to  provide  a  technical 
defence.  While 
is  extremely 
important, justice for the public at large is also important. So 
 
is  the  maintenance  of  confidence  in  the  criminal  justice 
 
system. If the result in the Palmer case had to be applied to 
other  cases  even  though  the  Court  of  Appeal  had  acted  in 
ignorance  of  the  appropriate  approach  this  would  indeed, 
reveal  a  most  unattractive  picture  of  our  criminal  justice 
system's ability to protect the public. 

justice  for  a  defendant 

35.  Here  we  prefer  the  approach  indicated  in  Bennion  on 
Statutory Interpretation (4th ed, 2002) at p. 134 which states: 

'The  basis  of  the  per  incuriam  doctrine  is  that  a 
 
decision given in the absence of relevant information 
cannot be safely relied on. This applies whenever it is 
at  least  probable  that  if  information  had  been  known 
the decision would have been affected by it.’""

56.	  We bear in mind that this Court is not rigidly bound by the doctrine of stare decisis. 
If we were to depart from Waller then our decision would be in favour of the two 
 
appellants  serving  a  long  sentence  with  a  ten  year  sentence  of  imprisonment  to  be 
served consecutively. It cannot realistically be suggested that the appellants have the 
means each to pay £92 million, a figure that, if unpaid, is also subject to interest at the 
rate of 8%.  The mere fact that  a loss to the Revenue of £12.6 million leads to two 
confiscation orders in the sum of twice £72 million (before uplift) shows, we believe, 
that  something  has  gone  wrong.  We  also  infer  from  the  fact  that  Waya  is  being 
reargued and from the questions being asked that there is concern about how the law 
of confiscation has developed. 

 
57.	 

 
58.	 

 
59.	 

Our view is much strengthened by the fact that, as we understand it, Flaux J was the 
first  judge  in  a  carousel  fraud  (and  there  have  been  many  of  them)  to  take  the 
approach which he did. In Sangha [2008] EWCA Crim 2562 (discussed by Flaux J), 
another  carousel  fraud,  the  very  experienced  judge  who  heard  the  confiscation 
proceedings,  HHJ  McCreath,  explicitly  rejected  the  submissions  made  by  the 
prosecution in that case that the benefit was the total value of each sale by the buffer 
 
company. He held that the benefit was the VAT element only. In the Court of Appeal 
 
 
the issue was mentioned but left open. 

 

Sir Derek Spencer supports the judge’s reasons for reaching the conclusion that he 
 
did  and  argues  that  Parliament  intended  that  the  words  “in  connection  with  the 
 
commission  of  the  offence”  were  intended  to  cover  the  obtaining  of  property  (or 
pecuniary advantage) in the circumstances of this case.  We do not agree. 

 

He  submits5  that  this  case  differs  from  both  Waller  and  Smith  in  that  this  case  is 
concerned with money received by the appellants in connection with the goods that 
were  sold  or  were  purportedly6  sold  in  furtherance  of  the  commission  of  the 
conspiracy.  Sir  Derek  points  to  a  passage  in  Smith  at  paragraph  27  in  which  Lord 
 
Rodger said that if the cigarettes had been sold, then the money received would have 
been property in terms of section 71(4).  As we have already said in the example we 
 
gave  in  paragraph  29  above,  the  sale  price  of  the  smuggled  cigarettes  would  be  a 
benefit. Sir Derek submits that the appellants’ sales or purported sales of the goods 
are analogous to the cigarettes. We do not agree. On the assumption that the goods in 
this case existed then, if the appellants had obtained the goods by theft or by fraud and 
sold them on, the resulting sale price would be a benefit. In this case the offence was 
cheating the revenue of the VAT, the selling or purported selling of the goods was a 
mechanism by which the fraud was committed and the necessary costs involved in the 
 
selling or purported selling were the costs of committing the offence.  We stress again 
that if any statutory assumptions applied (because, for example, the criminal lifestyle 
provisions in the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002) then the expenditure on committing 
the  fraud  would  be  assumed  to  be  a  benefit,  being  property  obtained  as  a  result  of 
 
general criminal conduct. 

 
60.	 

In  our  view  the  benefit  for  each  appellant  should  have  been  set  in  the  sum  of 
£12,662,822, to which will be added the necessary uplift to reflect the changes in the 
 
value of money as at the date of the confiscation orders made by Flaux J. 

                                                 
5 Because we had referred in our draft judgment to two cases not cited in oral argument, we gave the parties an 

opportunity to both see the draft and make further submissions, which they did. 

6 At para. 99 Flaux J pointed out that it was not a necessary part of the Crown’s case that the goods existed.

Realisable assets 

Ahmad & Ahmed 

 

61.	  We  turn  now  briefly  to  the  issue  of  realisable  assets.  The  judge  rightly  found  that 
 
MST and therefore the appellants had been involved in carousel fraud over a period 
commencing in early 2001. Also involved in the fraud was another company Alldech 
Ltd, the appellants being involved in that company in the same way as they had been 
involved in MST. The profits of the two companies together were over £30 million 
and  the  net  profits  were  calculated  by  the  prosecution  in  the  first  prosecutor’s 
statement to be in the region of at least £24 million.  The judge accepted a later figure 
of in excess of £25 million. The judge meticulously traced, in so far as he was able to 
 
do so given the obduracy of the appellants, where the money had gone.  

Flaux J rightly concluded that the appellants had hidden assets. They had both failed 
to disclose their assets and, to the extent to which there had been disclosure, they had 
not done so in such a way as to enable the true value of the assets to be determined. 
The judge rightly concluded that the appellants had failed to discharge the burden on 
them  of  demonstrating  that  their  realisable  assets  were  less  than  the  value  of  the 
benefit (para. 137).  Applying, in particular, a passage in the judgment of Moses LJ 
Telli v. Revenue and Customs Prosecution Office  [2007] EWCA Civ 1385, [2008] 2 
 
Cr App R (S) 48, paras. 10-11 and 30  Flaux J concluded (para. 138) that: 

 

“the court must make a confiscation order for the full value of 
 
the  benefit  and  has  no  discretion  to  order  confiscation  of  a 
 
lesser sum.” 
 

Sir Derek Spencer submits that that is the correct approach. Mr Tedd submits that the 
 
judge was wrong particularly in the light of a later judgment given by Moses LJ in R. 
 
v McIntosh and Another : [2011] EWCA Crim 1501; [2011] 4 All ER 917.  In this 
 
judgment Moses LJ sets out the statutory provisions, the competing approaches and 
concludes  that,  in  a  hidden  assets  case,  the  court  may  conclude  that  a  defendant's 
 
realisable assets are less than the full value of the benefit on the basis of the facts as a 
whole. He said: 

“6. These appeals concern the proper approach the court should 
take where a defendant is found not to have told the truth about 
his  realisable  assets.  The  essence  of  the  appeals  of  both 
appellants  is  that  the  judge  failed  correctly  to  apply  the 
provisions of s.71(6) of the 1988 Act. The appellants contended 
that they had no realisable assets. The judge disbelieved both of 
them. He concluded that they had concealed their assets. It was 
at  that  point,  so  it  was  argued,  that  he  misdirected  himself  in 
law:  the  judge  regarded  his  finding  that  the  appellants  had 
 
hidden assets as compelling him to make a confiscation order in 
the  full  sum  of  the  benefit  figure.  On  the  contrary,  submitted 
the appellants, a court is not required to make an order in the 
full  amount  of  the  benefit  figure  merely  because  it  concludes 
that  a  defendant  has  not  told  the  truth  about  his  realisable 
 
assets. A court may reject a defendant's evidence that he has no 
assets  or  reject  his  evidence  that  he  has  some  assets,  but  of 
insufficient value to meet the full benefit figure. In neither case,

so it was argued, is the court bound to make an order in the full 
amount of the benefit.  

7. S.71(6) provides:-

  

‘Subject  to  subsection  (1C)  above  the  sum  which  an  order 
made  by  a  court  under  this  section  requires  an  offender  to 
pay shall be equal to – 

(a) the benefit in respect of which it is made; or 

(b) the amount appearing to the court to be the amount 
 
that might be realised at the time the order is made, 

whichever is the less.’ 

 

This  provision  requires  the  court  to  assess  what  amount 
appears to the court to be realisable. It is now settled that the 
burden of proving that the amount that might be realised is less 
than the benefit rests on the defendant. In R v Barwick [2001] 1 
Cr App R (S) 129 the rationale advanced by Auld J in Rees (19 
July 1990, unreported) was adopted: the nature and value of his 
 
assets are essentially within a defendant's personal knowledge. 
But  it  should  be  noted  that  in  Barwick  the  judge,  at  the 
confiscation hearing, disbelieved the defendant but nevertheless 
concluded that his realisable assets were less than the amount 
 
of the full benefit figure (""doing as broad a justice in this case 
as  I  feel  able  to  do"",  cited  paragraph  8).  While  this  court 
counselled  against  any  assumption  that  a  defendant  would 
invest  the  proceeds  of  crime  (paragraph  39),  it  upheld  the 
factual conclusions of the judge and thus his acceptance that the 
realisable assets were less than the full amount of the benefit, 
notwithstanding that the defendant's evidence hid the truth. 

8.  In  May  ...  Lord  Bingham,  in  giving  the  opinion  of  the 
Committee, identified the objective of the statutory scheme: to 
deprive defendants of the benefit from their criminal conduct, 
""within the limits of their available means"" (paragraph 48 B). It 
would, he said, be unjust to imprison a defendant for failure to 
pay  a  sum  he  cannot  pay  (paragraph  35).  But  Lord  Bingham 
stressed the need to focus on the statutory regime in which no 
discretion  survived,  save  in  relation  to  the  application  of  the 
statutory assumptions (paragraph 43). Accordingly, although he 
acknowledged Lord Steyn's reference in R v Revzi [2002] 2 Cr 
 
App R 2 to the need for ""standing back and deciding whether 
there is or might be a risk of serious injustice"", that approach 
could only be adopted within the confines of the statute itself 
 
(paragraph 43). Lord Bingham made it clear that the injustice in 
ordering  a  defendant  to  pay  more  than  he  was  able  was 
recognised  by  and  catered  for  in  the  provisions  of  the  statute 
itself:
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 
 
 

Ahmad & Ahmed 

‘It  has  also  been  recognised  that  it  would  be  unjust  to 
imprison  a  defendant  for  failure  to  pay  a  sum  which  he 
cannot pay. Thus provision has been made for assessing the 
means  available  to  a  defendant  and,  if  that  yields  a  figure 
smaller  than  that  of  his  aggregate  benefit,  making  a 
confiscation  order  in  the  former,  not  the  latter,  sum.’  (our 
emphasis) (May, paragraph 35) 

9.  Accordingly,  there  is  no  room,  outwith  the  statute,  for  any 
residual discretion in the court to relieve a defendant, who has 
failed to prove that his assets are less than the full amount of 
the benefit. Mr Farrell QC, on behalf of McIntosh, argued that 
the court should always bear in mind the injustice of ordering a 
 
defendant  to  pay  more  than  his  resources  permitted.  He  drew 
attention  to  Lord  Steyn's  dicta  in  Revzi  (cited  above)  and 
Toulson  LJ's  emphasis,  in  Alan  Glaves  v  Crown  Prosecution 
Service  (q.v.  supra)  on  the  need  for  justice  and  proportion 
(paragraph  56).  Toulson  LJ  drew  on  Pill  LJ's  reminder  in  Re 
O'Donoghue 
that  however 
 
uncooperative or dishonest a defendant may be, the court must 
retain a sense of justice and proportion.  

[2004]  EWCA  Civ  1800, 

 

 

10. But that approach can only be deployed within the statutory 
scheme.  The  court  must  strive 
justice  and 
proportionality within the confines of the statutory scheme. The 
court can and should exercise those judicial virtues at the time 
 
when  it  answers  the  statutory  question  posed  by  s.  71(6), 
namely,  whether  it  appears  to  the  court  that  the  realisable 
amount is less than the amount of the benefit.  

to  achieve 

11.  When  Toulson  LJ  recognised  that  a  defendant  may  be 
 
ordered to pay more than he has, he was not imposing a third, 
extra-statutory test for assessing the realisable amount. On the 
contrary, he was recognising that the statutory scheme may lead 
to a result where:-  

‘a confiscation order is properly made in a larger sum than 
 
the defendant in truth is able to pay.’ (paragraph 52) 

12. O'Donoghue and Glaves were cases in which an appellant 
sought  a  certificate  of  inadequacy,  but  the  courts'  dicta  were 
relevant to the statutory scheme in relation to confiscation. Telli 
was also such a case but Mr Farrell suggested that courts had 
been applying dicta of mine in a rigid and unlawful manner, in 
those cases where a court concluded that a defendant had failed 
to disclose the true extent of his current assets. In Telli, a case 
under the Drug Trafficking Act, 1994, I said: 

‘10. Prima facie, the court is required to order recovery of 
the full value of the defendant's proceeds of drug trafficking. 
 
The court has no power to make an order for any lesser sum
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 
 
 

Ahmad & Ahmed 

 
unless it is satisfied that the total of the values at the time the 
 
confiscation  order  is  made  of  all  the  property  held  by  the 
 
defendant is less than the value of his proceeds as assessed 
according to s.4. 

11. If a defendant fails to satisfy a court of the value of that 
realisable  property  then  the  court  is  bound  to  make  a 
confiscation order in the full value of his proceeds. This is of 
significance in the instant appeal. A defendant should not, if 
the statutory scheme is properly followed, be able to avoid 
an order recovering the full value of his proceeds unless he 
identifies the realisable property he holds. If he refuses to do 
so then the court has no option but to order the full amount. 

 

... 

30. I should stress the significance, in the statutory scheme, 
of the Customs officer's conclusion that by no means all of 
Telli's  realisable  assets  had  been  identified.  As  has  so 
 
frequently  been  observed,  the  extent  of  realisable  assets  at 
the  time  of  conviction  is  likely  to  be  peculiarly  within  a 
defendant's own knowledge (see Lord Lane C.J. in Dickens 
[1990] 2 A.C 102 at 105E). The statute requires a defendant, 
if he can, to prove, for the purposes of s.5(3) that the amount 
which might be realised at the time the confiscation order is 
made, is less than the amount to be assessed to be the value 
of  his  proceeds  of  drug  trafficking.  Accordingly,  if  a 
defendant  is  found  not  to  have  disclosed  the  nature  and 
 
extent of his realisable assets, a correct view of the statutory 
 
scheme is that he cannot satisfy a court that the total value of 
all  his  realisable  property  is  less  than  the  value  of  the 
 
proceeds  of  his  drug  trafficking.  The  court  ought  not, 
 
therefore, issue any certificate pursuant to s.5(3).’ 
 

This rigid statement of principle was qualified at 31: 

‘For  the  reasons  I  have  given,  absent  identification  of  all  the 
realisable property held by him, a defendant normally will be 
unable  to  satisfy  the  court  that  the  amount  that  might  be 
realised at the time the confiscation order is made is less than 
the amount assessed to be the proceeds of his drug trafficking.’ 

13. The dicta in Telli, so Mr Farrell told us, have been adopted as 
the source of a requirement to make a confiscation order in the full 
amount  of  the  benefit  in  any  case  where  a  defendant  fails  to 
persuade the court that he has revealed the true current extent and 
true value of his assets. In any  case where a defendant has been 
 
found to have lied and diminished or hidden their true value, the 
court is bound to make an order in the full amount of the benefit.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

Ahmad & Ahmed 

 

14.  The  Crown  submitted  in  Glaves  that  it  was  not  open  to  a 
 
defendant to persuade a court that his assets were inadequate once 
it had been found that he had failed to disclose their full extent. 
This  submission  was  rejected  on  the  basis  that  Telli  does  not  go 
that  far;  it  must  be  confined  to  the  circumstances  of  that  case 
where it was plain that the assets which Telli had failed to reveal 
 
may, for all the court knew, have been ample to meet the full value 
of the benefit despite the loss of the statue of Dionysus.  

 

15. In the light of Glaves and May there is no principle that a court 
is  bound  to  reject  a  defendant's  case  that  his  current  realisable 
assets are less than the full amount of the benefit, merely because 
it concludes that the defendant has not revealed their true extent or 
value,  or  has  not  participated  in  any  revelation  at  all.  The  court 
must  answer  the  statutory  question  in  s.71(6)  in  a  just  and 
proportionate  way.  The  court  may  conclude  that  a  defendant's 
 
realisable assets are less than the full value of the benefit on the 
basis of the facts as a whole. A defendant who is found not to have 
told the truth or who has declined to give truthful disclosure will 
inevitably  find  it  difficult  to  discharge  the  burden  imposed  upon 
him. But it may not be impossible for him to do so. Other sources 
of evidence, apart from the defendant himself, and a view of the 
case as a whole, may persuade a court that the assets available to 
the defendant are less than the full value of the benefit.”  

64.	  We agree with this comprehensive analysis. 

 

 

 
65.	 

 

If  McIntosh had  been  available  to  Flaux  J,  we  doubt  very  much  whether  he  would 
have reached the conclusion that the confiscation order should be in the sum of the 
 
total benefit as found by him. 

66.	  We  add  this.  It  seems  to  us  that  a  confiscation  order  which,  due  to  its  magnitude, 
 
exceeds by far the likely assets of the defendant may operate as a disincentive to co-
operate.  In  the  present  case  even  if  the  appellants  produced  say  £25  million,  the 
default period would have to be served (unless a certificate of inadequacy could be 
obtained,  which  would  be  difficult,  see  Glaves  v  CPS  [2011]  EWCA  Civ  69  and 
McKinsley v Crown Prosecution Service [2006] EWCA Civ 1092). 

 

 

 

 
67.	 

Given  our  conclusion  that  the  benefit  figure  for  each  appellant  should  now  be 
£12,662,822 uplifted to reflect changes in the value of the money as at the date of the 
 
confiscation orders made by Flaux J, we have no doubt, given in particular the profits 
 
made  by  the  appellants  through  the  two  companies,  that  the  confiscation  figures 
 
 
should be in the same amount and to that extent we allow the appeals. 

Third and other grounds 

 

68.	  We turn to the third ground on which leave is sought. Mr Tedd submitted that a period 
of two months to pay the sum was too short given the complexity of unwinding the 
assets.  Sir Derek Spencer had asked that the judge give no time to pay, given the 
 
deliberate flouting of court orders.  As we understand the situation, the period of two 
months would have expired shortly before the appellants were due to be released from
--------

Ahmad & Ahmed 

their sentence.  If released there seemed little doubt that they would leave the country, 
given,  in  particular,  the  scale  of  their  assets  abroad  as  found  by  the  judge.  In  the 
 
unusual circumstances of this case it is unarguable that the judge was not entitled to 
 
set a very short period and we refuse leave to appeal on that ground. 

 
69.	 

Finally  the  appellants  themselves  have  submitted  grounds  of  appeal  and  some  100 
pages of documentation in support.  Mr Tedd declined to argue any of them but had 
no authority to abandon them. The three principal grounds may be summarised in this 
 
 
manner: 

A.  Conduct  of  the  prosecution.  It  is  submitted  that  the 
 
prosecution  misled  the  court  by  use  of  PII  material;  it 
continually  served  material  late;  the  prosecution  changed  its 
case; failures in disclosure. 

B.  Disparity  of  the  Crown’s  witnesses  with  the  crown’s  own 
case.  The  witnesses  John  Hughes  and  Christine  Harris  gave 
evasive evidence and changed their accounts. 

C.  Conduct  of  the  Judge  The  Judge  failed  to  understand  the 
facts  of  the  original  trial  particularly  the  role  of  MST  as  a 
 
broker  (not  principal);  the  earning  of  interest  on  customers’ 
monies  and  alleging  other  criminal  conduct  e.g  money 
laundering.  The  Judge  misdirected  himself.  He  continually 
interrupted the appellants’ cross-examination of witnesses and 
exaggerated  the  strength  of  the  evidence  against  them  in  his 
judgment.  The Judge misapplied the case law.  He prevented 
the  appellants  from  raising  crucial  evidence  by  threatening 
them  with  contempt  of  court.   He  took  every  opportunity  to 
undermine  them  by  referring  to  them  as  convicted  criminals. 
 
He  failed  to  consider  the  individual  circumstances  of  each 
appellant.  He incorrectly summed up the evidence. He failed to 
determine the correct source of documentary evidence. 

 
70.	 

In refusing permission to both appellants the single judge wrote: 

Your  Grounds  of  Appeal/handwritten  comments  on 
judgment 

the 
 

I have considered these matters in conjunction with what is said 
about them in the Respondent’s Notice at paragraphs 13.41. 

Decision 

The judge analysed the evidence at length and with care.  He 
 
gave detailed reasons for each of the conclusions he reached. 
 
These conclusions were clearly ones that were open to him to 
draw, on his findings of fact.  The findings of fact were for him 
to make having heard and considered the documentary and oral 
evidence, including from you in the witness box, and were ones 
 
he was entitled to make on the material before him.  He also set
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

Ahmad & Ahmed 

 
out  the  procedural  issues  which  arose,  and  how  and  why  he 
dealt with them, as he did. 

Nothing I have seen, and nothing said in either the Grounds of 
Appeal  against  Defendant’s  Confiscation  Order  or  in  the 
handwritten  comments  on  the  judgment/Detailed  Grounds  of 
Appeal gives me any reason to doubt that you had a fair hearing 
or that the findings made by the judge were not ones that were 
open  to  him  on  the  facts  or  that  he  made  any  material  error 
 
whether of fact or law. 

 

None of the grounds you have advanced are remotely arguable 
in my view and I am not persuaded your requests for transcripts 
 
is  justified.   Your  grounds  consist  to  a  considerable  extent  of 
assertion, and seem to me to be for the most part, a vexatious 
 
attempt to re-run and re-argue the hearing before the judge in 
toto  or  to  re-open  matters  determined  against  you  at  the 
substantive trial or to raise matters which are simply irrelevant. 

 
71.	 

 
72.	 

 
73.	 

To the extent to which the single judge is dealing with the points not argued by Mr 
 
Tedd,  we  agree  wholeheartedly  with  these  comments  and  reject  the  renewed 
applications on the grounds not the subject of submissions by Mr Tedd.  

In conclusion we quash the two confiscation orders of £92,333,667 and substitute for 
 
them  confiscation  orders  for  each  appellant  in  the  sum  of  £12,662,822  uplifted  to 
reflect  changes  in  the  value  of  the  money  as  at  the  date  of  the  confiscation  orders 
made by Flaux J. That uplifted amount is £16,145,098.00. 

Given that the maximum period of imprisonment in default is a period of ten years for 
 
an  amount  exceeding  £1  million,  we  leave  in  place  the  default  period  ordered  by 
Flaux J, namely ten years to be served consecutively to the sentence of imprisonment 
of seven years passed by HHJ Alexander on 30 March 2007. Given our rejection of 
the third ground and given the failure to pay any money, we will leave in place the 
order  made  by  Flaux  J  that  payment  had  to  be  made  within  two  months  of  the 
 
confiscation order. 

74.	  We certify that the following point of law of general public importance is involved in 

 

our decision: 

Is  the  total  amount  of  money  received  into  a  bank  account 
 
controlled by a defendant, as a result of the sale or purported 
sale  of  goods  by  a  buffer  company  in  the  furtherance  of  an 
MTIC carousel fraud, property obtained by him as a result of or 
in  connection  with  the  commission  of  the  offence,  as  defined 
by  section  71(4)  of  the  Criminal  Justice  Act  1988,  so  as  to 
constitute his, or part of his, benefit?

Sentencing remarks by the Honourable Mr Justice Singh 


10 February 2012
 
 

 

 

On 12 January 2012 you pleaded guilty to one count of theft, that is Count 2 
on the indictment, which relates to the theft of £72,500 belonging to barristers’ 
chambers at number 9 St John’s Street, Manchester, between October 2008 
and November 2009. 

The theft consisted of taking 12 unauthorised loans or advances from your 
chambers which were never repaid. By pleading guilty you have admitted that 
you committed a serious offence of dishonesty. 

You are now aged 46.  You became a barrister in 1988, specialising in 
criminal law. In 1997 you moved to the chambers at 9 St John’s Street and in 
2000 became the deputy head of those chambers. By all accounts you were a 
highly successful criminal barrister and were regularly instructed by the 
Crown Prosecution Service. 

But you also had other business interests. These included a property business 
and a specialist car hire business. The property business had expanded to the 
extent that, by June 2008, your property portfolio amounted to some 15 to 20 
properties, which were valued at around £6.5-7.5 million. The properties were 
subject to mortgages, amounting to about £4 million.  

The chambers at 9 St John’s Street had about 79 members.  Joanne Kelly 
worked at the chambers from 2000 until October 2009. She was the chambers 
administrator until April 2008 and then Director of Finance and Administrator.  

During 2008 your financial position began to worsen as there was a general 
downturn in the property market. You sought to restructure some of your debts 
and to sell one of your properties.

On 1 October 2008 you requested and received the first of the unauthorised 
advances from Joanne Kelly which you never repaid to your chambers. Each 
of the payments went into one of two accounts held by you with NatWest 
bank. One had an overdraft limit of £1,000 and the other a limit of £60,000. 
The first payment was for £4,000 and brought the account back into credit 
from being above its overdraft limit.  

There then followed a number of occasions on which you obtained 
unauthorised advances from chambers funds, in order to assist you in avoiding 
going over your overdraft limits.  

Joanne Kelly asked you about repayment and there is evidence before the 
Court that you told her that you had spoken to Mr Charles Garside, the head of 
chambers, and that she should not worry. It is accepted on your behalf that you 
were “economical with the actualité” in speaking to Mr Garside. Mr Garside 
denies that he was ever told about the repayment advances. Joanne Kelly did 
not mention your failure to repay chambers to Mr Garside because you had 
told her that you had spoken to him about your financial position and that 
things were in hand. 

 

In November 2009 evidence about your advances emerged and Mr Garside 
decided to report the matter to the police. On 10 December 2009 the police 
went to your home address and conducted a search of the premises and also 
searched your room in chambers. On 14 May 2010 you attended Whitefield 
police station in Manchester and were interviewed under caution. You 
accepted in interview that you had made requests for advances from chambers 
and that Joanne Kelly had recorded them correctly. You stated that you needed 
the money to pay off short-term commitments and your ability to repay was 
dependent on selling one or more of your properties. You agreed that your 
approach to Joanne Kelly was outside the normal procedure for members of 
chambers who owed money. 

I have seen an agreed basis of plea in this case. It states that: 

 
1.	 

 
2.	 

 
3.	 

At all material times the defendant was struggling to service his debts 
owing within his property business due to the increasing difficulty both 
in selling properties and obtaining credit to service the debts. These 
difficulties were caused by what has become known as “the credit 
crunch”. In other words they were difficulties of liquidity rather than 
assets. 

The defendant on 12 occasions identified in the [Prosecution’s] 
opening note obtained advances from Chambers’ funds to facilitate the 
juggling of his debts. 

On each occasion that he did so, via Jo Kelly, Chambers DFA, the 
defendant expected to “trade out” of his financial difficulties such that 
 
he could and would repay the advances; that expectation became 
 
increasingly unrealistic.

You, perhaps more than anyone else, ought to have known that what you were 
doing was both dishonest and unlawful. You have brought dishonour upon an 
honourable profession and shame upon yourself and your family.   

I have had regard to the relevant sentencing guidelines on theft which are 
applicable to cases such as yours. In cases which fall within the bracket where 
there is theft of over £20,000 and breach of a high degree of trust, the 
appropriate starting point is 3 years imprisonment with a range of 2 to 6 years. 
That guideline applies to a person of previous good character like you but 
applies to a conviction after trial. 

You pleaded guilty in this case but only on the first day of the scheduled trial.  
In the circumstances of your case, the credit which I will give you for this will 
be limited to 10-15%.  

I have taken account of the pre-sentence report prepared by the Probation 
Service in your case.  However, I am not able to accept the suggestion in that 
report that this case could be dealt with by way of a community order.  As the 
report acknowledges, the custody threshold has been passed in this case.  I am 
 
required to follow the relevant guidelines unless I am satisfied that it would be 
contrary to the interests of justice to do so.  I am not satisfied that it would. 

I have considered very carefully everything that has been ably said by Mr 
Beggs QC in mitigation on your behalf.  In addition, I have taken account of 
the numerous testimonials which have been placed before me from barristers, 
solicitors and others.  It is clear that you have made a substantial contribution 
to your profession in your career at the Bar, which is now very likely to come 
 
to an end.  It is also clear that you have helped others around you through pro 
bono work and in other acts of generosity. 

Having regard to both the aggravating and mitigating features of your case, I 
am of the clear view that the only sentence which is available to this Court in a 
case as serious as this is one of immediate imprisonment. If you had been 
convicted after a trial the sentence would have been 3½ years.  Taking into 
account your guilty plea, the sentence which I pass upon you is 3 years 
imprisonment. 

You will serve one half of that sentence and will then be released on licence 
for the rest of your sentence. You will then be liable to recall by the Secretary 
of State during that period of licence.

Sentencing Remarks of HHJ Burgess  

 

10 February 2012 

 

 Over 60 million people live in the United Kingdom. More than 51 million of us live 
in England. Our population is made up of people of all colours, creeds and cultures. 
For the vast majority of the time the vast majority of us get along together very well, 
and the greatest freedom that we all enjoy is to live in peace and without fear. 
 
The law has evolved and adapted to protect that freedom. In particular, laws have 
been passed to prevent written material being distributed which is intended to stir up 
hatred. This has proved necessary because a small minority of our broad community 
sometimes seeks to stir up hatred against their fellow citizens merely because those 
fellow citizens are perceived to be different in some way. 
 
In 1986 the Public Order Act made it an offence to distribute threatening, abusive or 
insulting written material with intent to stir up Racial Hatred. In 2006 the legislation 
was extended to prevent the stirring up of hatred on religious grounds.  
 
Most recently the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 again extended the area 
of protection. It was clearly perceived by parliament that people of a particular sexual 
orientation needed protection from that minority who wished to stir up hatred against 
them. 
 
This happens to be the first prosecution under that legislation. 
 

 

1
--------
Much has been said during the course of the trial about freedom of expression, and the 
 
freedom to preach strongly held beliefs; beliefs, which may have some foundation in 
scripture. 
 
Freedom of speech is a cornerstone of democracy and a basic ingredient of any free 
society. Parliament clearly had this very much in mind when this legislation was 
passed, and it may be helpful if we remind ourselves of the specifics of the offences 
of which you have been convicted. 
 
The charge was one of distributing written material which was threatening with intent 
to stir up hatred on the grounds of sexual orientation. 
 
Parliament, clearly considering the issue of freedom of speech, added that discussion 
or criticism of sexual conduct or practices or the urging of people to refrain from or 
modify such behaviour shall not be taken of itself to be threatening or intended to stir 
up hatred. There was no intention to stifle debate, merely to protect. 
 
The Jury had the benefit of listening to all of the evidence in this case. They knew 
what the constituents of the offence were, and they had well in mind that the offence 
would not be committed by mere adverse criticism of homosexuality. Their 
convictions can only have been on the basis that the document that all three of you 
were distributing was threatening, and that by distributing it you all intended to stir up 
hatred against homosexuals. 
 
The leaflet depicted a mannequin swinging from a hangman’s noose, under the 
caption of “Death Penalty?” 
 Next to that was the information that in 1533 Buggery was punished by hanging. 
 
On the other side was text which said among other things that the only debate among 
classical authorities about how to punish homosexuality was the method of carrying 
out the execution: burning, flinging from some high place or stoning. It said that the 
death sentence was the only way that the immoral crime (of homosexuality)can be 
erased from corrupting society”. 
 

 

2
--------
In the course of evidence we heard what effect, reading that leaflet had upon four 
homosexual men. All felt threatened. 
 
The background to the distribution of these leaflets outside the mosque after Friday 
Prayers and through letter-boxes on residential streets is worth mentioning, because it 
gives some idea of the hostility felt by you defendants and the level of organisation. 
 
The Derby Gay Pride march was to take place on 10th July 2010. You Ihjaz Ali took 
on the role of organising a campaign to counter this march, and on the day of the 
march, you, Kabir Ahmed and 12 others staged a small counter demonstration. No 
criminal charges arose as a result of that demonstration. I only mention it because the 
Gay Pride March was the focus of your activity, and because the very small number 
who attended your demonstration gives a good indication that the vast majority of the 
Muslim community did not want to be associated with what you were doing. 
 
In the lead up to that day, what I am sure were hundreds of anti-gay leaflets were 
distributed. The first two were not the subject of charges, but they do provide the 
context of these offences. They may not have been “threatening”, but most people 
would regard them as offensive at the very least. “G.A.Y. God Abhors You” and 
“Turn or Burn” 
You, Ihjaz Ali, organised the distribution of those leaflets, and you, Kabir Ahmed, 
also distributed them. 
 
There were complaints to the Police about them. You, Ihjaz Ali were subsequently 
made aware of those complaints. That knowledge did not stop you continuing to 
distribute the leaflet that is the subject of the charge. 
 
You, Kabir Ahmed and you Razwan Javed, both distributed the Death Penalty leaflet 
outside the Mosque at Friday prayers on 2nd July 2010. You Ihjaz Ali had provided 
them with the leaflets. You also provided the other two defendants with the leaflets 
that they distributed on 4th July. 
It would be wrong for anyone to suggest that Ahmed and Razwan Javed were acting 
as little more than postmen. There was evidence on the papers to support the 
contention that you intended to stir up hatred. You, Razwan Javed had been making 

 

3
--------
internet searches on topics relevant to the content of the leaflets and you, Kabir 
Ahmed made a video which you posted on You-tube, containing the slogan: Gay 
today- Paedo tomorrow. You8 were also found to have quantities of the leaflets at 
your home when you were arrested. 
 
It is right to say that you, Ihjaz Ali had contact with the Police, and discussed a 
number of matters with the Community Officer. This was largely to do with the 
Organisation of the protest, and it is significant that the Police were never consulted 
about the content of the 3 leaflets the Jury had to consider. 
 
Given that this is the first prosecution of its type, there are no guidelines and no 
guideline cases. Accordingly, I have reminded myself of general principles as set 
down in sections 142 and 143 of the CJA 2003. I have borne in mind that one of the 
purposes of sentencing is the reduction of crime (including its reduction by 
 
deterrence). 
 
I have borne in mind that, when considering the seriousness of these offences I have 
to consider not only the culpability of the offender, but also the harm that was caused, 
or was intended to be caused, or might foreseeably have been caused. 
 
Here, I am obviously keen to dissuade anyone from distributing this sort of material in 
the future. 
 
Looking at the harm done, I have considered the threat felt by the individuals that 
gave evidence at the trial, and the likelihood that others were similarly affected.  
 
I have borne in mind that the residents of the streets who received this leaflet do not 
seem to have changed their attitude or behaviour towards their gay neighbours. Indeed 
it was heartening to hear one witness say that he experienced great support from his 
neighbours following the distribution of these leaflets. 
 
That said, you have been convicted of intending to stir up hatred. It follows that your 
intention was to do great harm in a peaceful community. 
 

 

4
--------
It is also heartening that there have been no similar offences since your arrest. No-one 

seems to have been tempted to copy you. 

However, it is hard to ascertain exactly how much harm you have caused by 

distributing this leaflet outside the Mosque. 

 
I have considered a number of cases supplied to me by Miss Cheema. They are of 

general interest, but none of them is factually similar, and in a number of instances, 

the charges relating to volatile material are secondary offences, and the sentencing 

Judge has had to consider totality. 

I have also borne in mind the case of R v Sheppard and Whittle (2010 2 Cr. App. R 

(S) 68) which relates to Racist material on the internet. Again it is not factually 
similar to this case, but the Court of Appeal did say that they regarded the need to 
deter others as being an important element of sentencing in cases of this kind. 
 
In mitigation I bear in mind your good character. I have considered the personal 

references that speak highly of you, the contribution to society that you make and are 

capable of making. I have read expressions of remorse from each of you. They would 

have carried far more weight had you pleaded guilty and acknowledged your 

culpability, but it may be the case that you do now recognise the fact that what you 

did was wrong. 

I am also conscious of the fact that these offences were committed in July 2010 and 

that none of you have offended since, or done anything to aggravate the situation. 

Nevertheless these offences have to be marked by a Prison sentence, for all the 

reasons I have already given. 

 
In your case Ihjaz Ali, of all the people that were in the dock, you were clearly the 

main organiser. You distributed the leaflets to others who in turn delivered them. I 

have to deal with you for all four counts on the indictment. 

 
The sentence in your case is 2 years on each count concurrently. 

Razwan  Javed and Kabir Ahmed, I cannot make a distinction between you. As I have 

already explained there is evidence that you were more involved than just acting as 

passive distributors. 

 

 

5
--------
The sentence in each of your cases is 15 months. 
 
That means each of you will serve up to half you sentence inside prison. The balance 
will be served on licence. There may be requirements of that licence. Should you fail 
to comply with those requirements or should you commit another offence during the 
licence period, you are like to be recalled to serve some or all of the balance of your 
sentence.

R v Mervyn Westfield 


 

Sentencing Remarks of His Honour Judge Anthony Morris QC 


 

17th February 2012 


 
 

 

You have pleaded guilty to count 1 of accepting a corrupt payment in 
 
September 2009. 
 
You are now 23 years of age. In about 2005, when you were 17 you became a 
professional cricketer with Essex CCC. It was a condition of your contract that 
you would always play to the best of your ability. You thereafter played for 
your county primarily as a fast bowler for the 2nd XI but also on occasions for 
the 1st XI, and earned about £20,000 a year playing for your county. 
 
It is well known that substantial bets are placed not only on the outcome of 
cricket matches but also on specific events in the course of matches, eg on how 
many runs a bowler might concede in a particular over. This form of betting is 
known as spot betting and is much more available when matches are televised. 
 
 
According to your basis of plea, in August 2009, you were visiting the home of 
Danish Kaneria, a senior Essex professional and former Pakistani 
international, when he introduced you to two of his friends. Kaneria told you 
of the possibility of your making large amounts of money for conceding a 
certain number of runs in a particular over bowled by you in a match. I accept 
that such an approach was made to you by Kaneria. He had been warned in 
2008 by the ICC over his connections with a bookmaker, who was involved in 
illegal betting markets. In addition, he had made similar approaches to other 
Essex players who had laughed them off as a joke. 
 
At first you ignored Kaneria’s approach, but similar approaches were made to 
you on a number of occasions after that until you felt under some pressure to 
agree. Finally, shortly before you were due to play in a NatWest Pro40 limited 
overs match on 5th September 2009 between Essex and Durham, you agreed 
to concede a minimum number of runs in the first over you bowled in that 
match in exchange for a payment of £6000. 
 

1
--------
Although there was little by way of education available to county cricketers in 
2009 as to how to deal with corrupt approaches by others, I am satisfied that 
you would have known from the outset that what was being offered was a 
corrupt payment and that you could and should have refused it.  I am also 
satisfied that if you had any concerns about the approaches being made to 
you, you had an opportunity to mention them to the team captain or 
management, or if you were nervous of doing so, at least to your friends within 
the team. You chose not to do so. 
 
This match was televised live on Sky TV in this country, by Star Cricket across 
the Middle East and much of Southern Asia, including India and Pakistan. It 
must have been clear to you that large bets would be placed on the basis of 
your conceding these runs. 
 
The nature of the agreed corrupt behaviour in your case is different from that 
in the recent case of Majeed, Butt, Asif and Amir. In that case, bowlers agreed 
deliberately to bowl no balls. That is something over which they would have 
had control. In the present case you were to concede a minimum number of 
runs in an over. This is to an extent dependent on the skill of the batsmen in 
scoring runs and of the fielders in preventing them doing so and is therefore 
more difficult to guarantee. 
 
You conceded 10 runs in your first over in the Durham match and duly 
received the £6000 you were promised in cash. Your basis of plea makes it 
clear that you deliberately under-performed, by bowling badly in that match, 
and received the money for doing so. 
 
Shortly after that, when your friend and colleague Tony Palladino was visiting 
 
your home, you went to your wardrobe, removed a plastic bag and tipped the 
contents onto the bed. The contents were a large amount of £50 notes. You 
then told Palladino that Kaneria had approached you and told you he had a 
friend who would pay you money if you conceded more than a certain number 
of runs in your first over in the Durham match, that you were to receive 
£6000 and Kaneria £4000 and that you had got the money for doing so. I am 
satisfied this was the £6000, which you had received. 
 
There appears to be uncertainty as to the minimum number of runs you were 
to concede. Palladino when first asked about the matter in March 2010, 
remembered it as 12. Chris Wright another member of the Essex team was 
told by Palladino that you had told him the number was 10. You maintain the 
number was 12. It probably does not matter as you accept that you were 
deliberately underperforming in that first over in order to carry out your side 
of this corrupt bargain. 
 
No legal domestic betting market appears to have been compromised by your 
 
corrupt agreement, and so the inescapable inference is that the person who 
made the corrupt payment must have taken advantage of this information by 
seeking to influence a legal overseas market or an illegal market in this 
country or overseas. 
 

2
--------
The criminality here is that for financial gain you betrayed the trust placed in 
you to play honestly and to the best of your ability. You were trusted to do so 
by other members of your team, your employers, the supporters of Essex CCC 
and the very many followers of the game throughout the world. If because of 
corrupt payments it cannot be guaranteed that every player will play to the 
best of his ability, the reality is that the enjoyment of many millions of people 
around the world who watch cricket, whether on television or at cricket 
grounds, will eventually be destroyed. 
 
No doubt out of a misguided sense of loyalty to you, Palladino did not go 
straight to the Essex authorities, but he did tell other Essex players, including 
Chris Wright and Adam Wheater and the matter eventually came to the 
attention of the Essex authorities in about March 2010. They immediately 
reported it to the England and Wales Cricket Board and the police were 
informed. You were subsequently interviewed by the police and charged. 
 
I give you credit for your guilty plea, but that plea was entered very late in the 
day. When you were first asked about the matter by the Essex captain and 
coach in March 2010, you denied any knowledge of it. You were interviewed 
by the police on 29th March 2010 and lied to them, saying the approach had 
not come via Kaneria, you had not agreed to accept the money, and you had 
not received it or shown it to Palladino. In your defence statement, dated May 
2011, you repeated those lies. It was only in mid-December 2011, shortly 
before this case was fixed for trial on 12th January 2012, that you notified the 
court that you were prepared to plead guilty to count 1. 
 
 
However, even to the probation officer who prepared the pre-sentence report 
dated 9th February 2012, you denied that you had deliberately under-
performed in the Durham match and maintained that you had bowled to the 
best of your ability. Although I accept that pleading guilty has involved a great 
deal of courage on your part, I have grave doubts whether even now you are 
 
really showing the great remorse, which your counsel says you are showing, as 
you have constantly sought to minimise what you did. In all the 
circumstances, the credit you are entitled to is significantly reduced and I 
 
assess it at 20%. 
 
I take into account your age, your previous good character, the contents of the 
pre-sentence Report, the many testimonials submitted on your behalf and 
what has been said so ably on your behalf by your counsel. I also take into 
account that you were put under some pressure to agree to this corrupt 
proposal by those who were more sophisticated than you. 
 
In my judgment it is necessary to impose an immediate custodial sentence in 
this case not only to mark the seriousness of the offence but also to deter 
others in your position from accepting such corrupt payments. In reaching 
 
this conclusion, I take into account the sentences imposed by Cooke J recently 
in the case of Majeed, Butt, Asif and Amir, and in particular the sentence of 6 
months imprisonment on the defendant Amir, which was upheld on appeal. 
Your counsel has urged me to draw a distinction between your sentence and 
the sentence imposed on Amir. I accept that there are grounds for making 

3
--------
such a distinction but not such as to justify the imposition of a suspended 
sentence in your case. 
 
The sentence I impose is one of 4 months imprisonment. Unless you are 
released earlier under day release you will serve one half of this sentence in 
custody and then will be released for the remainder of it. Your release will not 
bring your sentence to an end. If after your release and before the end of the 
period covered by your sentence you commit any further offence, you may be 
ordered to return to custody to serve the balance of this sentence outstanding 
at the date of the further offence, as well as being punished for that new 
offence. 
 
In addition I am asked to make a confiscation order against you in the agreed 
sum of £6,000. I determine the benefit you have received in the agreed sum of 
£6000, determine the recoverable amount to be £6000 and make a 
confiscation order in the sum of £6000. This is to be paid within 28 days with 
a sentence of 6 months imprisonment in default to run consecutively to the 
sentence imposed on Count 1.

JUDGE STEIGER:  These three defendants, Oliver O’Neill, Daniel 

Tuesday, 17th January, 2011 
 

Chrapkowski and Thomas Lane, are all in their early 20s, none 
has any previous convictions and all are from an apparently 
respectable background. 

They fall now for sentence for two incidents:  First, on 
19th November 2010 concerning O'Neill alone.  On that occasion 
the defendant became involved in an argument with a member 
of the public who was attempting to prevent O'Neill from 
being abusive to the staff in the Late Night Store at about 3 
o'clock in the morning.  O'Neill was with others, waited 
outside the store, where there was a discussion which quickly 
turned into violence in which O'Neill kicked several times, 
three or four, the head of Mr. Rogeiro, the member of the 
public attempting to restrain bad behaviour inside the shop. 
In the course of that incident Mr. Rogeiro had a fracture to 
part of his skull, the eye socket.  The defendant was 
eventually traced for that matter and was seen by the police 
and interviewed on 26th November. 

The second incident took place three days after that date 
on 29th November when all three again or rather all three were 
in central Manchester in the early hours of the morning 
having been drinking a considerable amount.  So far as 
O'Neill and Chrapkowski are concerned they fall to be 
sentenced for inflicting grievous bodily harm, the same 
charge as relates to O'Neill on the earlier occasion.  Lane, 
the third member of the trio, pleaded guilty only to the 
lesser charge of affray.

There are some similarities with the second incident and 
the first in that at about 3 o'clock in the morning a member 
of the public was objecting to the manner in which the three 
defendants were engaging in hooliganism.  There was a 
confrontation.  It is accepted by Lane that he began the 
incident with, as it were, shadow boxing with Mr. O’Reilly, 
shortly after that other two became involved.  Chrapkowski 
punched Mr. O’Reilly, appears to have then tripped him up and 
kicked him in the stomach.  O'Neill at a time when O’Reilly 
was on the ground kicked him forcefully to the head such as 
to cause a fractured jaw and contusion or bruising to the 
brain from which the victim appears still to be suffering as 
revealed in his victim impact statement. 

That incident so far as O'Neill was concerned, I repeat, 
took place only three days after the defendant being bailed 
for the earlier and indeed was a topic apparently boasted of 
by him to those who were present and listening. 

The defendants have all pleaded guilty, Lane to the 

charge of affray at the plea and case management hearing on 
8th August and O'Neill, although not on that occasion, did at 
about that time signify that he was prepared to plead guilty 
to the offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm.  He 
pleaded guilty at the outset to the earlier incident. 
So far as Chrapkowski is concerned he did not plead guilty 
until the trial, which necessitated the attendance of 
witnesses, he had until that point been asserting self-
defence but abandoned that claim and accordingly he is

entitled to significantly less credit than the others for 
their pleas of guilty. 

I have carefully considered the material submitted and 
the oral arguments advanced by counsel in relation to these 
three defendants, the pre-sentence reports and all of the 
testimonials and letters, which in some cases are very 
complimentary.  I have borne in mind I hope that no defendant 
has any previous convictions and to the extent to which it 
might be seen as mitigation drink was involved and O'Neill in 
particular has now taken steps to give it up.  I repeat 
that the defendants have pleaded guilty and I bear in mind 
the factual basis of the plea, which I have attempted to 
recite in the facts so far as both Lane and Chrapkowski 
concerned.  In particular in the case of O'Neill I bear in 
mind that the two incidents that he was responsible 
personally for the infliction of significant bodily harm 
on the two victims and the range of sentencing prescribed 
by the Sentencing Council and earlier authorities. 

The very least sentence in the case of O'Neill is 27 
months’ imprisonment, which will be arrived at as to 12 
months for count 2 on T117165 and 15 months consecutive on 
count 2 to T117285.  There is no time to count against him, 
is there, Miss Flynn? 

MISS FLYNN:  No, there is not, your Honour. 

JUDGE STEIGER:  Very good, take him down, please.  In the case of 
Chrapkowkski, there will be a sentence on count 2 of T117385 
of 12 months’ imprisonment.  I have, however, reflected

on the mitigation advanced and bear in mind that Chrapkowski 
was only involved in the one incident and was not involved in 
any kicking to O’Reilly’s head.  Not without some hesitation, 
I am persuaded by the submissions of counsel and the other 
material in the case that it might be just in his case to 
suspend the sentence. 

Stand up Chrapkowski.  The sentence of 12 months in your 
case will be suspended for 12 months, which means that if you 
commit any offence within the next 12 months punishable with 
imprisonment you will serve that sentence and whatever else 
may be appropriate.  You must perform unpaid work for the 
public totalling 160 hours in all within the next 12 months. 
Should you fail to perform that the suspended sentence can be 
implemented and, finally, there will be a curfew to be 
electronically monitored in your case that you remain at home 
indoors between the hours of 9pm and 5am.  Breach of those 
terms will result again in the sentence being implemented. 
You are free to leave the dock but you should not leave court 
before speaking to the probation officer. 

MISS FLYNN:  Can I just check the time? 

JUDGE STEIGER:  Two months 9-5.  In the case of Lane he on the 
facts was the least involved in the second incident and in 
particular there was no physical contact between him and Mr. 
Reilly, although but for his activities the later and more 
serious phrases of that episode might never have occurred. 

Stand up, Lane.  In your case the sentence is that you be 

the subject of a community order for 12 months and that you 

 

 
 
 

4
--------
carry out unpaid work for the community totalling 120 hours 
within the next 12 months.  You too must abide by a curfew of 
a shorter duration than that for Chrapkowski, in your case it 
will be for one month between the hours of 9pm and 5am. 
Finally, since you are in work, unlike the others, you must 
pay £250 towards the costs of the prosecution within the next 
six months.  You should not leave court before speaking 
to the probation officer about when you are to start your 
unpaid work.

Sentencing Remarks of Mr. Justice Saunders 

 

13 February 2012 

 

 
On the last occasion Mr Justice Simon clearly set out why these offences are so 
serious. You are a very senior officer. The breach of trust that the public has 
placed in you is the more serious because of your senior appointment. You 
have been a role model to many other people as a result of your achievements 
as a police officer. 
 
You used your position and your power to arrest a man because of a private 
dispute that you had with him. I like Mr. Justice Simon will deal with you on 
the basis that the earlier conduct of Al-Baghdadi had been provoking. 
Nevertheless you arrested him without good cause and you then made false 
statements about his arrest which led to him being remanded in custody 
overnight and then had to wait on bail for six weeks to see whether he was 
going to be charged and stand trial. 
The offences that you alleged Al Baghdadi had committed were serious ones.  
 
Against these offences must be set your previous good character and your 
distinguished service as a police officer. 
For those offences Mr Justice Simon sentenced you to 4 years imprisonment 
and no criticism can properly be advanced nor has your counsel attempted to 
do so. 
 
The situation in which I sentence you is different. Having served about 15 
months of your sentence, the Court of Appeal quashed your conviction and 
ordered a re-trial. It was not your fault that the information that led to that re-
trial had not been available at your first trial. You have had to wait for a 
further period on bail before the re-trial could take place.  
 
I take that into account. More importantly I take into account that you will be 
re-starting a prison sentence. It is well known that for a first offender in 
particular it is the start of a custodial sentence that is most difficult. For police 
officers, sentences of imprisonment are especially and I am told and accept 
that you spent a substantial time in solitary confinement as a result of your 
treatment by other prisoners.
--------
In all those circumstances, I feel able to pass a lesser sentence on you than was 
the appropriate sentence on the last occasion. However, you will have to 
return to prison for a period of time. The 462 days that you have already 
served will count towards that sentence. I sentence you to 3 years 
imprisonment, concurrent on each count. 
 
I will adjourn the application for costs and any legal aid contribution until I 
have a detailed account of your means.",2012-02-13 00:00:00,UK Crown Court

Sentencing Remarks of  Mr Justice Wilkie 


 

9 February 2012 


 

 
Introduction 
 

 

 

 
1.	  This is a difficult and complex sentencing of 9 offenders arising out of what 
 
the  Crown  says,  and  I  accept,  is  a  novel  factual  matrix  namely,  the 
commission of terrorist offences by fundamentalist Islamists who have turned 
to  violent  terrorism  in  direct  response  to  material,  both  propagandist  and 
instructive,  issued  on  the  internet  by  Al  Quaeda  in  the  Arabian  Peninsula, 
(AQAP). It gives rise to a number of issues of principle and has a high profile. 
I  have,  therefore,  prepared  these  remarks  in  written  form  and  they  will  be 
immediately available on the Judicial Website when this hearing has finished. 

   
2.	  All  of  these  defendants  fall  to  be  sentenced  after  pleading  guilty  to  specific 
 
counts on the indictment, (counts 9, 10, 11 and 12) on specific bases of plea 
which the Crown says are acceptable to them. 

 

3.	  All  the  defendants,  save  for  Mohibur  Rahman,  have  pleaded  guilty  to  the 
offence of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to 
Section 5 (1) of the Terrorism Act 2006. The particulars recited in respect of 
 
counts 9, 10 and 12 are different from each other. In Count 9, the particulars, 
in respect of Usman Khan, Mohammed Shahjahan, and Nazam Hussain, are 
that  they  were  engaged  in  conduct  namely:  travelling  to  and  attending 
operational  meetings,  fund  raising  for  terrorist  training,  preparing  to  travel 
abroad, or to assist others to travel abroad, to engage in training for acts of 
terrorism. In Count 10, the particulars in respect of Mohammed Chowdhury, 
Shah  Rahman,  Abdul  Miah  and  Gurukanth  Desai  are  that  they  engaged  in 

1
--------
conduct with the intention of committing an act of terrorism: namely preparing 
to produce and detonate an explosive device in the London Stock Exchange. 
 
In  Count  12,  in  respect  of  Omar  Latif,  the  particulars  are  that,  with  the 
intention  of  assisting  others  to  commit  an  act  of  terrorism,  he  engaged  in 
conduct namely travelling to and attending meetings on 7th November and 12th 
 
December 2010. 

 

4.	  Mohibur Rahman has pleaded guilty to possession of an article for a terrorist 
 
purpose contrary to Section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000 namely, that on the 
20th December 2010, he was in possession of “Inspire” magazine, Summer and 
Fall 2010 in circumstances which gave rise to a reasonable suspicion that their 
possession was for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or 
instigation of an act of terrorism. 

 

5.	  Originally, all these defendants faced an 8 count indictment which included, as 
against all of them, Count 1 - alleging a breach of Section 5 (1), the particulars 
being compendious and general in content and Count 2 – alleging conspiracy 
to cause an explosion in the United Kingdom. The circumstances by which the 
Defendants, respectively, have pleaded guilty to Counts 9, 10, 11 and 12 will 
be returned to later. 

 

 

 

 

 
The Defendants and the basic facts 
 
 

 

6.	  Save for Chowdhury and Usman Khan, who at the material time were 20 and 
19 years respectively, all the Defendants were in their middle to late twenties 
 
at the relevant time in the late autumn 2010. They all either had been born in 
the United Kingdom or had been born in Bangladesh and come to this country 
a number of years before these events. The five defendants who were based in 
London or Cardiff and 2 of the Stoke based offenders were Bangla Deshi in 
origin. Of the 4 who lived in Stoke 2, Usman Khan and Nazam Hussain were 
Pakistani in origin and their families came from the same village in Kashmir. 
Chowdhury, Omar Latif, Usman Khan, Mohibur Rahman and Nazam Hussain 
have  no  previous  convictions.  Shah  Rahman  has  one  only,  which  was 
committed  during  the  period  covered  by  this  indictment.  Desai  has  minor 
convictions,  Shahjahan  has  previous  convictions  and  Abdul  Miah  had  a 
significant history of criminal convictions between 2004 and 2007 involving, 
amongst other things, possessing two prohibited weapons for the discharge of 
noxious liquid gas in 2005, threatening behaviour, also in 2005, theft from a 
person and false imprisonment for which, in 2007, he served a sentence of 18 
 
months  imprisonment  and  a  recent  offence  of  fraud.  Both  Miah  and  Desai, 
who are brothers, have had a number of aliases and have changed their names 
by deed poll. 

 

7.	  In each case, according to their defence case statements, there came a time, 
about a year or more before these events, when the offenders became actively 
engaged  in  the  Muslim  faith.  They  were  attracted  to  and  espoused  radical 
versions of Islam which are rejected by the vast majority of Muslims in the 
United Kingdom and elsewhere as illegitimate and a perversion of that faith. 
Be that as it may, it is clear, from a meticulous survey of the evidence by the 
prosecution  that,  in  becoming  so  attracted,  they  fell  under  the  influence  of 

2
--------
radical or extremist clerics who preached an obligation, by way of Jihad, to 
engage  in  struggle  including  not  only  fighting  non-Muslim  occupiers  of 
Muslim lands, but also extending the fight to attack civilians within the United 
 
Kingdom. This particular doctrine, which rejects the concept of the “covenant 
of security,” that if you live in a western country you should not attack your 
host  country  directly,  is  espoused  by  Al  Quaeda  based  in  the  Arabian 
Peninsular (AQAP) and is associated with a radical preacher known as Anwar 
Al Awlaki, now dead, whose aims include attacking Western Countries by any 
means possible. 

 

 

8.	  Each  of  these  defendants,  in  their  different  ways,  engaged  actively  in 
proselytising their radical Islamism in public by preaching, a process known as 
 
Da’wah. By so doing, as they were fully aware, they came to the attention of 
the security services.  

 

9.	  I accept the contention of the Crown that, through a network of meetings held 
across  the  country  for  the  purposes  of  Da’wah,  some  of  the  offenders,  in 
Stoke, Cardiff and London came to know, or to know of, some of the others 
and there came a time, in late autumn 2010, when these defendants, in their 
separate locations, began to associate with one and other for a purpose which, 
as far as 8 of them is concerned, went beyond preaching or missionary work or 
 
proselytising. They took the step of deciding to engage in, and engaging in, 
conduct  in  preparation  for  terrorist  violence  as  advocated  by  AQAP  and 
 
Anwar  Al  Awlaki  in  particular.  In  the  summer  and  autumn  2010  AQAP 
published on the internet magazines known as “Inspire”. There was a summer 
and an autumn edition as well as another publication “39 ways to serve and 
participate in Jihad”. The avowed purpose of Inspire was to reach out to those 
in distant lands, who might support the AQAP view of the world, to encourage 
them,  independently  and  of  their  own  initiative,  to  engage  in  violent  acts 
wherever they might be. 

 
10. It is the Crown’s case, which I accept, that the lynchpin of the coming together 
of the defendants from their various geographical locations was Mohammed 
 
Chowdhury who acted as a sort of convenor or conduit.  I also accept from the 
 
evidence  that,  whilst  he  had  that  role,  and  that,  as  between  him  and  Shah 
Rahman, his fellow Londoner, he took the lead, he was by no means the leader 
of the group which then coalesced. I also accept that he was an obsessive self 
publicist. I accept on the evidence, which I have been taken through at length 
by the prosecution in opening, that, of the three groups, the Stoke group was, 
and  was  considered  to  be,  pre-eminent.  They  had  a  longer  term  view,  were 
 
focussed, among other things, on fundraising for their plans to establish and 
recruit for a terrorist military training facility under the cover of a madrassa on 
land owned by Usman Khan’s family, where there was already a mosque, and 
 
looked to the others to supply them with substantial quantities of cash. They 
eschewed,  having  briefly  considered  it,  the  taking  of  immediate  action,  as 
untrained  novices,  such  as  bombing  certain  pubs  in  Stoke.  Rather,  they 
intended to proceed on a more long term and sustained path, to establish and 
operate  that  terrorist  military  training  facility,  at  which  Usman  Khan  and 
Nazam Hussain would train, which would make them, and others whom they 
would recruit to be trained there,  more serious and effective terrorists. They 

3
--------
would  initially  operate  in  Kashmir  but  later  may  return  to  the  UK  and  may 
commit  acts  of  terror  in  this  jurisdiction,  though  it  was  not  a plan  that  they 
should  do  so.  I  also  accept  that,  within  the  Stoke  group,  Shahjahan  was  the 
leader but that Usman Khan and Nazam Hussain were very close to him in the 
hierarchy. I also accept that, of the Cardiff and London groups, Miah was pre-
eminent  by  force  of  his  personality,  as  evidenced  in  the  role  he  took  in 
meetings  and  discussions,  and  from  the  fact  that  he  was  experienced  in  the 
ways of crime and, in particular, on the use of aliases and false identities. He 
 
was one of the London/Cardiff group whom the Stoke group appeared to take 
 
seriously  as  a  potentially  useful  recruit.  I  also  accept  that  Miah’s  brother, 
 
Desai,  was  also  well  regarded  by  the  Stoke  group  but  I  also  accept,  as  is 
common  ground  and  clear  from  the  monitored  discussions,  that  he  played  a 
subordinate role to Miah. I accept that Shah Rahman was not highly regarded 
by Miah and was not allowed to attend an important meeting in Cardiff on 12 
December. I also accept that, even on that day, he managed to draw attention 
 
to  himself  by  being  arrested  for  a  minor  public  order  offence  in  London.  I 
accept  that Latif, though  a well regarded  member of the Cardiff group who 
attended  the  7thNovember  and  12th  December  meetings,  in  fact  never 
participated in the preparation of any specific action.  

 
 
11. The events relied on by the crown include meetings of members of all three 
groups  in  parks  in  Cardiff  and  Newport  on  the  7th  November  and  12th 
 
December, attended by most of the Offenders. There was also a visit by Desai 
and Miah to London where they spent significant time with Chowdhury and 
Shah Rahman driving around various parts of London and engaging in pointed 
discussions  in  which  a  number  of  possible  terrorist  actions  were  discussed 
including sending 5 letter bombs through the post or by DHL. In fact that idea 
 
was  soon  abandoned  as  impracticable.  A  Mumbai  style  attack,  which  was 
briefly mentioned in passing by members of the London/Cardiff group was, it 
is accepted by the crown, never seriously considered.   

 

 
12. There was also monitoring of conversations in various properties and vehicles 
in London, Cardiff and Stoke, the fruit of which has been very helpfully dealt 
with by Mr Edis in his extensive and meticulous opening of the case 

 
13. The Crown’s case, which is not now disputed by the defendants, is that the 
purpose  of  these  meetings  and  the  subject  of  many  of  the  monitored 
 
discussions, was discussion of possible ways for them, either in their separate 
geographical areas or together, to start engaging in terrorist violence. 

 
14. It is clear from the wide ranging discussions that the groups were considering 
 
a range of possible actions. They included fund raising for the establishment 
and  operation  of  the  terrorist  military  training  madrassa  in  Pakistan, 
undertaking training there and recruiting others to undertake terrorist training 
 
there, sending letter bombs through the post, attacking pubs used by British 
 
racist  groups,  attacking  a  high  profile  target  with  an  explosive  device  and  a 
 
“Mumbai” style attack by terrorists. As I have indicated the only ideas which 
the  crown  say  crystallised  as  intentions,  which  were  the  subject  of  any 
preparatory acts, were in respect of the madrassa and the placing of a small, 

4
--------
but potentially lethal, explosive device, a pipe bomb, in a toilet in the London 
Stock Exchange and are  the subject, respectively, of counts 9 and 10. 

15. By the time of the period covered by the indictment, the 1st November to the 
 
 
21st December, the Security Services had become aware of the emergence of 
this  group  as  a  possible  source  for  terrorist  activity  and  it  is  clear  that  they 
embarked  on  a  resource  intensive  and  highly  sophisticated  process  of 
monitoring and surveillance. So successful was it that, on the evening of 19th 
 
December, Chowdhury and Shah Rahman were overheard going through, in 
some detail, instructions to construct a pipe bomb contained in the Inspire 1 
magazine  under  the  heading  “Make  a  bomb  in  the  kitchen  of  your  Mom” 
 
which had been downloaded onto Shah Rahman’s computer at 19:43, some 18 
minutes before the conversation began. As it seemed that an act of violence by 
 
using a pipe bomb was imminent, the Security Services intervened early the 
following morning and all the defendants were arrested.  

 
16. Great praise is due to the Security Services both for the thoroughness and the 
sophistication of their monitoring and their surveilling of these defendants, as 
well as their alertness to intervene at the optimum time before any harm could 
be done by the offenders. As a consequence these nine have pleaded guilty to 
very serious offences 

 

 

 

 

 

 
The Indictment and the Pleas of Guilty 
 

 
17. The indictment, as originally drawn, included, as count 1, a Section 5 offence. 
The  particulars  read  as  follows  “Between  1st  November  and  21st  December 
 
 
2010 with the intention of committing an act or acts of terrorism or assisting 
 
others  to  do  so  engaged  in  conduct  in  preparation  for  giving  effect  to  that 
intention namely travelling to and attending operational meetings, discussing 
methods, materials, targets for a terrorist attack, carrying out reconnaissance 
on  and  agreeing  attack  targets,  downloading  researching  and  discussing 
electronic files containing practical instruction for a terrorist attack, obtaining 
the means and materials for such an attack.” 

 
18. That is a compendious list of all the activities observed and monitored by the 
Security Services during the relevant 7 weeks or so. If it had been contested 
and tried it would have involved a trial of many months and, on a finding of 
guilt, such a finding in respect of all of the facets of the activities of the group 
to  which  I  have  referred,  including  the  wide  ranging  discussions  about 
different forms and sites for attacks.  

 

19. The jury for this trial was sworn on 24th January. The prosecution needed a 
 
few days to put the finishing touches to its opening to reflect its final view on 
certain disputes about the accuracy about certain transcripts of conversations. 
During that period the prosecution and the defence embarked on discussions 
about the defendants’ pleading guilty on specific bases. The first defendants to 
plead  guilty  were  3  of  the  Stoke  defendants,  Usman  Khan,  Shahjahan  and 
Hussain who pleaded guilty to count 9. The basis of that plea was as follows: 
first,  they  were  trying  to  raise  funds  to  build  a  Madrassa  beside  an  already 
existing Mosque in Kashmir: second, the long term plan included making the 

5
--------
Madrassa available for men who would be fighting to bring Sharia  to Kashmir 
in Pakistan: third, the plan included some, including at least one of the Stoke 
defendants, being able to have fire arms training in or around the Madrassa; 
fourth, they did not intend to participate in an act of terrorism in the UK in the 
immediate  future.    Fifth,  they  contemplated  that,  once  trained,  they  might 
return to the UK and engage in some sort of terrorist activity but there was no 
timetable, no targets identified, nor any method agreed. The Crown on its part 
agreed that it would not allege that those defendants were criminally liable as 
participants, either primary or secondary, in the planned attack on the London 
Stock Exchange, and would not allege that any defendant was party to a plan 
to carry out any other attack in the UK in the immediate future. It has emerged 
in the course of this hearing that both Nazam Hussain and Usman Khan agree 
that they intended to travel to the Madrassa in January 2011.  

 
20. The Crown’s position was that these three defendants were part of the group 
of 9 formed in October 2010 to decide how best to further the Jihadist cause 
including  planning  for  acts  of terrorism.  Meetings  on  the  7th  November  and 
12th  December  were  intended  to  further  this  and  were  conducted  within 
Section  5.  Different  proposals  were  considered,  but  in  the  event  two  plans 
emerged,  the  attack  on  the  Stock  Exchange  and  the  plan  of  the  Stoke 
defendants identified in their basis of plea. Each part of the group was aware 
of  the  plan  of  the  other  and  the  matters  were  discussed  freely.  The  group 
continued  to  function  until  the  arrests  as  a  forum  for  discussion  of  possible 
courses  of  action.  The  Crown  accepted  that  Mohammed  Shahjahan  did  not 
intend  to  travel  to  the  Madassa  to  train.  The  Crown  contended  that  these 
 
defendants contemplated that some of those trained would commit their acts of 
terrorism abroad but that others might return to the UK and commit them here 
but accepted that nothing had been agreed as to timetable, target or method. 
Further  the  Crown  accepted  that,  after  going  to  Kashmir,  experiences  there 
might mean that no such activity would have actually taken place in the UK. 

 

 

 
21. Two  defendants  Mohammed  Chowdhury  and  Shah  Rahman  sought  a 
Goodyear direction on the basis of a draft count 10 and they were supported in 
this request by the Crown. Having been given an indication as requested on 
the  morning  of  31st  January,  some  hours  later, first  Mohammed  Chowdhury 
and  Shah Rahman and then Desai and Miah pleaded guilty to the new count 
10 which particularises the Section 5 offence in the following terms: “Between 
the 1st day of November and 21st day of December 2010 with the intention of 
committing an act of terrorism, engaged in conduct in preparation for giving 
effect to that intention namely preparing to produce and detonate an explosive 
device  in  the  London  Stock  Exchange”.  The  basis  of  plea  for  Mohammed 
Chowdhury  included  the  following:  “There  was  a  plan  to  place  a  live 
explosive device of a type that was capable of causing death or serious injury 
in the Stock Exchange in London. The intention was that it should be exploded 
but not that it should cause death or serious injury. The intention was that it 
should cause terror, property damage and economic damage. It was, however, 
a  clear  risk  that  it  would  in  fact  cause  death  or  serious  injury.  It  was  the 
intention that this plan would be carried out in the near future but at the time 
of  arrest  no  materials  had  been  obtained  with  a  view  to  constructing  an 
 
explosive device nor had any firm date been set for carrying it out. Meetings 

6
--------
and discussions relied on by the prosecution were in part in furtherance of this 
plan. Various other projects were also considered during this time. The role of 
Mohammed Chowdhury was as the lynchpin of the group playing a significant 
role  in  the  researching  and  selection  of  the  target  and  researching  the 
construction of a device on 19th December 2010 by reading Inspire 1”. 

22. Shah  Rahman’s  written  basis  of  plea  was  that  early  discussions  on  the  28th 
 
 
November  identified  the  objective  of  causing  economic  damage  and 
disruption. In due course he became party to a plan with Chowdhury to place a 
live explosive device in the Stock Exchange in London. The intention was that 
it should be exploded, but not cause death or serious injury, but that it should 
cause terror, disruption and financial damage.  However, there was a clear risk 
that it would cause death or serious injury. He and Chowdhury were involved 
in  target  selection  and  the  planning  for  the  construction  of  a  device  on  19th 
 
December,  when  both  researched  the  construction  of  a  device  by  reading 
Inspire 1. 

 
23. Abdul Miah’s written basis plea repeats the same elements but says his role 
was  limited  to  discussing  the  plan  and  carrying  out  research  on  the  London 
Stock Exchange. Desai’s written basis of plea was essentially the same though 
he stated that he was party to a plan to place an explosive device in a toilet in 
the  London  Stock  Exchange  of  a  kind  capable  of  causing  death  or  serious 
injury. 

 
 
24. The Crown accepted and agreed those bases of plea but reserved the right to 
 
refer to the wider spectrum of discussions as placing the events the subject of 
that new count and the agreed basis of plea into context. 

 
 
25. Count  12  is  the  final  Section  5  count  and  concerns  Omar  Latif  only.  The 
particulars are that between the 1st November 2010 and 21st December 2010, 
with the intention of assisting others to commit an act of terrorism, he engaged 
in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism by travelling to and attending 
meetings on 7th November and 12th December 2010. The written basis of plea 
 
records that on the 7th November he arrived at the meeting late and left on a 
 
number of occasions, returning to central Cardiff by car. He was not present 
for much of the time the others were together. He attended the meeting of the 
 
12th December, being driven there by car by Abdul Miah. He was aware that 
conversations concerning terrorist activity were likely to take place and such 
conversations did take place. He did not participate in the development of any 
plans of a terrorist nature, including those relating to the Stock Exchange or 
terrorist training in Pakistan. 

 
26. Finally,  Count  11  is  an  offence  of  possession  of  an  article  for  a  terrorist 
purpose contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The particulars are 
that  on  the  20th  December  Mohibur  Rahman  was  in  possession  of  articles, 
namely Inspire magazine Summer and Fall 2010, in circumstances which gave 
rise  to  a  reasonable  suspicion  that  their  possession  was  for  a  purpose 
connected with a commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism. 
His  written  basis  of  plea  is  that  he  had  in  his  possession  Inspire  magazine 
 
summer  2010  recovered  from  a  hard  drive.  He  had  been  in  possession  of  it 

 

7
--------
since  15th  October.  It  was  last  accessed  on  the  16th  October  and  was  never 
 
shared with any of his co-defendants or any other 3rd party. Second, he had in 
his possession Inspire magazine Fall 2010 recovered from the same hard drive. 
He had been in possession of that publication since 25th September. It was last 
accessed  on  the  16th  October.  He  had  never  shared  that  with  any  of  his  co-
defendants or any other 3rd party. 

 
Dangerousness 
 
 

 
27. It is common ground that both the Section 5 offences and the offence under 
Section  57  of  the  2000  Act  are  specified  offences  and  that  they  are  serious 
offences for the purposes of Section 224 of the 2003 Criminal Justice Act. In 
order for an offender to be dangerous I have, in addition, to be of the opinion 
that  there  is  a  significant  risk  to  members  of  the  public  of  serious  harm 
occasioned by the commission by the offender of further specified offences. I 
have  regard  to  the  fact  that,  in  their  defence  statements,  none  of  these 
defendants resiled from any of the views which they have held. Some of them, 
notably  Chowdhury,  Shah  Rahman,  Usman  Khan,  Shahjahan  and  Nazam 
Hussain have written to me that they now repent of those views and Desai has, 
through his counsel, expressed the wish to go on a deradicalisation programme 
 
whilst in custody. That is welcome, but the sincerity or long term nature of 
that stated contrition is more relevant for those who will have to manage their 
 
sentences  than  for  me  in  passing  them.  I  also  have  regard  to  the  fact  that, 
though each one of them, other than Mohibur Rahman, has pleaded guilty to a 
Section 5 offence on a specific basis, I also have to have regard to all the other 
 
surrounding circumstances whereby it is clear that their discussions related not 
 
just to a single imminent incident at the London Stock Exchange, but also to a 
range of possible types of attack and targets, as well as to the plans of the three 
 
Stoke offenders to engage in long term plans to finance, construct and operate 
a terrorist military training facility, to recruit trainees to receive training and, 
in the cases of Usman Khan and Nazam Hussain, to avail themselves of that 
 
training.  I  am  satisfied  that,  in  the  cases  of  each  of  the  offenders  who  have 
pleaded guilty to a section 5 offence there is such a significant risk as triggers 
 
the dangerousness provisions. That includes Omar Latif. He attended both the 
meetings  of  the  group  of  9  and  was  regarded  as  a  member  of  the  Cardiff 
group. I am satisfied that this would not have been the case had he not shared 
the core intentions of the group that each geographical group, whether on its 
own or in combination with another, would prepare to engage in some form of 
violent terrorism,. As such I am satisfied that he poses the necessary risk for 
 
him to be regarded as dangerous. In addition, as the terms of imprisonment I 
am  minded  to  impose  on  each  of  these  8  would  be  at  least  4  years,  I  am 
satisfied that all the statutory requirements  of dangerousness are met for each 
of them. 

 

 

 

 
28. Dangerousness  in  their  cases  having  been  established,  I  have  to  consider 
whether, in each case, an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment for public 
protection or a determinate or an extended, sentence would be the appropriate 
 
disposal in the light of my finding that each offender poses a significant risk of 
serious  harm  to  the  public.  I  remind  myself  of  the  decision  of  the  Court  of 
Appeal in C, [2009] 1 WLR 2158 CA, where the Court of Appeal said that a 

8
--------
court may only impose an indeterminate sentence if satisfied that the risk to 
the public would not be adequately protected by a determinate sentence with 
an extended licence period under Section 227. I also remind myself that, in the 
case of a conviction for a terrorism offence there are now strict requirements 
 
that an offender keep the police notified of various personal details, including 
address, or change of name, travel plans for a period of 30 years, where the 
sentence is 10 years or more, or 15 years when the sentence is between 5 – 10 
years  or  10  years  when  the  term  of  imprisonment  is  under  5  years.  (The 
 
Counter Terrorism Act 2008) I also remind myself that in the most serious of 
the  cases  to  which  I  have  been  referred  as  relevant  for  the  purpose  of 
sentencing namely Jalil and others [2009] 2 CR. App. R. (S) 40 and Karim 
[2011] EWCA Crim 2577, where the terrorist activity involved, or potentially 
involved,  was  described  as  about  as  grave  as  it  could  be,  the  trial  judges 
imposed,  without  any  appellate  criticism,  extended  sentences  rather  than  an 
indeterminate  sentence  which,  in  each  case,  was  available,  under  the  CJA 
2003 regime in Karim and its predecessor in the case of Jalil. 
 

 
 
29. I have in each case to consider the nature and extent of the risk posed, in the 
light of the offence of which the offender is guilty and I have to consider the 
extent to which the public may be adequately protected by the conditions of 
licence in the event that, at a fixed point, the offender would be released from 
 
prison  and  fall  to  serve  the  rest  of  his  sentence  being  supervised  in  the 
 
community, though at risk of return to prison to serve its entirety if he were to 
break his conditions of licence or commit a further offence of any sort.. 

30. I have reached different conclusions in respect of Shahjahan, Usman Khan and 

 
Nazam Hussain to that which I have reached in respect of the other 5. 

 

 
 
31. In the case of those three, in my judgment, the nature of the offending and the 
nature  of  the  commitment  of  the  offenders  to  long  term  terrorist  aims  is 
different  to  that  of  the  other  5.  They  were  about  the  long  term  business  of 
establishing and operating a terrorist military training facility in Pakistan, on 
land  owned  by  the  family  of  Usman  Khan  to  which  British  recruits  whom, 
they  would  recruit,  would  go  to  receive  training.  Usman  Khan  and  Nazam 
Hussain were to obtain that training and were, thereafter, to obtain first hand 
terrorist experience in Kashmir. Furthermore it was envisaged by them all that 
ultimately  they,  and  the  other  recruits  may  return  to  the  UK  as  trained  and 
experienced terrorists available to perform terrorist attacks in this country, on 
one  possibility  contemplated,  in  the  context  of  the  return  of  British  troops 
from Afghanistan. These three were happy to engage with the other groups, 
whom they knew were intending, in the short term, to commit terrorist attacks 
in the United Kingdom. They contemplated, however briefly, such an attack 
themselves but it is clear that their focus was not distracted by that from the 
serious long term plan to which I have referred. 

 
32. It is also clear from conversations they had on 12th December, and from the 
 
structure document prepared by Shahjahan, that these three judged themselves 
to  be  operating  at  a  higher  level  of  efficacy  and  commitment  than  the  rest, 
save that they expressed some admiration for Miah and Desai. They thought it 
proper  that  Shahjahan  should  be  addressed  as  “ameer”  by  Miah.  In  my 
 

 

9
--------
judgment it is proper to infer that they regarded themselves as more serious 
jihadis than the others. In my judgment, having considered the evidence, that 
was a conclusion they were entitled to reach. In my judgment they are more 
 
serious jihadis than the others. They were working to a long term agenda, no 
less deadly in its potential than the potential for damage and injury the subject 
of  the  short  term  intentions  of  the  others.  They  were  intent  on  obtaining 
training for themselves and others whom they would recruit and, as such, were 
working  to  a  more  ambitious  and  more  serious  jihadist  agenda.  In  my 
 
judgment,  these  offenders  would  remain,  even  after  a  lengthy  term  of 
 
imprisonment,  of  such  a  significant  risk  that  the  public  could  not  be 
 
adequately  protected  by  their  being  managed  on  licence  in  the  community, 
subject  to  conditions,  by  reference  to  a  preordained  release  date.  In  my 
 
judgment  the  safety  of  the  public  in  respect  of  these  offenders  can  only 
adequately  be  protected  if  their  release  on  licence  is  decided  upon,  at  the 
earliest, at the conclusion of the minimum term which I fix today 

 

 

 

 
33. I have formed the conclusion that the cases of the other 5 do not require an IPP 
but that they may be managed adequately upon release within the community 
at  a  point  in  their  sentence  fixed  by  me  today.  As  with  all  determinate 
 
sentences Parliament has provided a means of managing risk which involves 
 
the  offender  being  released  after  half  his  sentence  has  been  served,  having 
being  given  credit  for  time  on  remand.  Upon  release,  however,  and 
particularly  in  terrorist  cases,  that  release  is  subject  to  the  most  stringent 
 
conditions.  First,  there  are  the  onerous  notification  requirements  to  which  I 
have already referred which will run for 30 years. Second, and for the lengthy 
period to be identified in the extended sentence, the offender must serve the 
sentence in the community subject to the most onerous of licence conditions. 
They will, inevitably, include a requirement of residence, a curfew, and may 
well include restrictions on activities, restrictions on movement, restrictions on 
contacts  and  other  conditions  designed  to  manage  the  threat  they  pose.  The 
 
approach  to  the  imposition  of  conditions  and  their  policing  will  be  multi 
agency based and will include the involvement of the security services, whose 
 
efficacy  in  monitoring  and  controlling  these  offenders  has  already  been 
 
admirably demonstrated.  

 

 

 
34. In my judgment it is unrealistic to suppose, and the crown does not seek to 
persuade me, that any of these 5 has shown any sign of having a long term or 
 
strategic  perspective  so  as  not  to  be  capable  of  being  adequately  monitored 
and controlled by the agencies to whom I have already referred. It is clear that 
they  were  determined  to  carry  out  some  high  profile  violent  terrorist  action 
even  though  untrained  and,  in  effect,  complete  novices  and  without  any 
meaningful consideration of how they might avoid the security at their chosen 
 
target to make good their attack.  Chowdhury is a compulsive self publicist 
and is incapable of masking his true intentions. Shah Rahman failed to impress 
even the Cardiff members of the group to the extent that he was not invited to 
the 12th December meeting and, in fact, on that same day, drew attention to 
himself by committing a minor, jihadist inspired, public order offence. Miah, 
 
though  criminally  experienced,  has  singularly  failed  on  many  occasions  to 
conceal  his  wrong  doing,  resulting  in  a  series  of  criminal  convictions  and 
Desai, his brother, it is agreed by all and from a proper study of the product of 

10
--------
the probes, is very much subordinate to his brother Miah. Latif’s involvement 
 
does not come close to requiring an IPP.  

 
 
35. I have, in considering IPP, 	 had regard to the relative youth of Usman Khan 
but,  in  my  judgment,  having  had  regard  to  all  the  evidence  I  remain  of  the 
view that for him, despite his youth, a sentence of IPP is necessary.  

 
 
36. I have also had regard to the fact that the Stoke 3 had come to the attention of 
the authorities by virtue of their da’wah activities. It is, however, their ability 
 
to  act  on  a  strategic  level  and  to  consider  the  long  term  at  the  price  of 
eschewing immediate spontaneous action that persuades me that the risk they 
 
pose is so significant that it can only be adequately met by an IPP. 

 
37. Mohibur  Rahman    	has  pleaded  guilty  to  an  offence  under  section  57  of  the 
2000 Act. Although it is a specified offence no case has been cited to me in 
which a finding of dangerousness has been made in respect of such an offence. 
In light of the basis of plea which is accepted by the crown, even taking into 
account  the  context,  to  which  I  will  return  later,  I  am  not  satisfied  that  the 
statutory  requirements  for  dangerousness  are  made  out 
in  his  case. 
Accordingly the sentence on him will be a determinate sentence.  

 

 
 
Discount for a Plea of Guilty 
 
 

 
38. As  with  all  defendants  who  plead  guilty  they  are  entitled  to  a  discount  in 
sentence for having done so. In most cases a plea of guilty on the outset of the 
 
trial results in a discount against sentence of the order of 10%. This is a trial of 
 
unusual  complexity  and  length.  Had  it  fought  it  was  estimated  that  it  could 
have lasted up to 5 months at huge further public expense. Furthermore, the 
offences to which these defendants have now pleaded guilty are very serious 
and, by pleading guilty, each offender has exposed himself to a lengthy prison 
 
sentence.  Having  regard  to  these  factors,  in  my  judgment  the  appropriate 
discount for a plea of guilty in this case is of the order of 20%. I observe that 
in the case of Jalil the pleas of guilty at the commencement of the trial in the 
circumstances of that case, attracted discounts of between 15% and 20%.  

 

 
Determination of Length of Sentence. 
 
Introduction 
 
 

 
39. The Crown submits, and I accept, that sentencing in respect of the Section 5 
offences is highly fact specific and that there is only a limited number of cases 
from which guidance by way of useful comparison can be obtained.  

 
 
40. Of  those  cited  to  me  in  my  judgment  there  are  three  which  are  particularly 
 
salient. The first is Jalil and others [2008] EWCA Crim 29 10 where there 
was  a  plea  of  guilty  to  conspiring  to  cause  explosions  of  a  nature  likely  to 
endanger life. The highest of the sentences imposed in that case was, in the 
 
judgment of the Court of Appeal, based on a sentence, after a trial, of just over 
30 years. 

 

 

11
--------
41. The conspiracy in that case was of 4 years duration. It involved, at one stage, 
detailed written descriptions and plans for the destruction of the buildings of 4 
key American financial institutions, prepared for the consideration of the Al 
 
Qaeda  leadership,  in  the  form  of  a  professional  or  corporate  presentation.  It 
also involved plans for similar attacks on British targets and involved detailed 
proposals of several different possible methods of destruction. One involved 
packing  stretch  limousines  with  propane  gas  cylinders  and  explosives  and 
detonating them in the underground car parks beneath target buildings. Other 
proposals were for a dirty, or radioactive, bomb using many thousands of an 
item  of  domestic  equipment  containing  some  radioactive  material.  The  plan 
 
also involved the sabotage of a major rail artery, perhaps in a tunnel under the 
River Thames, and the hi-jacking of a petrol tanker for use to ram a building. 
The plan was for all or some of those attacks to be synchronised on the same 
 
day.  The  Court  of  Appeal,  in  upholding  the  sentences,  said,  amongst  other 
things, that the potential for mass injury and loss of life was very substantial. It 
involved  projected  attacks  on  different  buildings  in  urban  places  and 
radioactivity as well as explosions.  

 
42. The  second  is  Karim  [2011]  EWCA  Crim  2577.  In  that  case  the  offender 
 
 
received a total of 30 years imprisonment for the commission of a number of 
offences  pursuant  to  Section  5.  The  most  serious  of  those  offences  were 
contested, so the offender did not have the benefit of a plea of guilty. He was a 
graduate in electronics and micro-electronic systems, having graduated from 
an English university in 2002. By that stage he had been involved for a couple 
of  years  in  a  fundamentalist  grouping.  By  the  end  of  2006  he  came  to  this 
 
country  to  live  and  work  and,  by  that  time,  had  formed  the  view  that  Jihad 
involved  an  obligation  to  commit  offensive  actions  against  unbelievers.  He 
had been offered various employment positions but had opted to be employed 
by British Airways as a graduate trainee and from then, until his arrest, for a 
 
period  of  3  years  and  3  months,  he  worked  incessantly  to  further  terrorist 
purposes whilst managing to keep his real opinions concealed behind a quiet 
and unobtrusive lifestyle, such concealment involving heavily encrypted email 
 
correspondence. In the course of those activities he was in direct contact with 
Anwar Al Awlaki and made three specific proposals to him for ways in which 
he could, himself or with the assistance of others, commit a terrorist attack. 
 
First a physical attack on BA’s IT servers which would cause huge financial 
loss and jeopardise its very existence. Second, an electronic attack to disable 
BA’s IT and cause, at least, a temporary cessation of operations, the cost being 
estimated at £20 million a day. Third, getting a bomb on board a plane bound 
for the US. Al Awlaki responded to this by discouraging an electronic attack 
for fear of blowing his cover, but Al Awlaki told him to explore the idea of the 
bomb. All the offender needed was the go ahead from Al Awlaki himself to 
act on his intentions. The learned sentencing Judge described the aggravating 
features of the 3 counts of which he was convicted as being: his direct contact 
with Al Awlaki and the nature of the proposals put forward by him, some of 
which were, as he described, about as grave as can be imagined and that, taken 
together, were matters of the utmost gravity.  

 

 

12
--------
43. At the other end of the spectrum, in the case Tabbakh [2009] EWCA Crim 
 
464, the offender received a sentence, after a trial and a conviction, which was 
 
based on a starting point of 8 years. The offender had compiled a set of bomb 
 
making  instructions  and  had  gone  some  way  towards  assembling  the 
ingredients. He had not yet succeeded, in part because the ingredients, though 
of the right substances, were of poor grade and because he had yet to make, or 
obtain, a detonator, though reference to electric wires were contained in the 
diagrams he had prepared.  

 
 
44. The offender was 39 years of age and had no previous convictions. The Court 
 
concluded that, for an offender, doing his best to make a bomb in this country 
with a view to a terrorist act, but which was, as yet, not viable for want of a 
 
detonator  and  the  right  grade  of  ingredients,  a  sentence  of  8  years  was  not 
outside the range available to the Judge.  

 
Comparing the seriousness of Counts 9 and 10. 
 

 
45. Counsel  for  the  three  Stoke  offenders  have  urged  on  me  that  the  count  9 
offence  is  not  as  serious  as  the  count  10  offence.  It  does  not  involve  any 
intention in the short term to make any violent attack in the UK. It is focussed 
 
on fundraising and the providing, or obtaining, of training, the primary aim of 
 
those trained being to operate in Kashmir. They have pointed out that there are 
 
specific  statutory  offences  concerning  fundraising,  and  the  provision,  or 
obtaining, of terrorist training which could have been charged on the admitted 
conduct and which carry maximum sentences of the order of 10 or 15 years 
imprisonment, and reflected in lower sentences passed by the courts for those 
 
guilty of such offences. 

 

 

 

 
46. The  crown  says  that  counts  9  and  10  are  of  equal  seriousness.  They  are 
different because they reflect different conduct. Whereas the conduct alleged 
in count 10 is very serious and immediate in its potential impact, the conduct 
alleged in count 9 is also very serious and reflects a long term and calculated 
threat to the UK and elsewhere. 

 
47. In my judgment the crown is right so to characterise these offences as of equal 
 
seriousness.  The  crown  has  obtained  pleas  of  guilty  to  section  5,  not  to 
specific  lesser  statutory  offences.  The  particulars  of  count  9  place  at  the 
forefront attendance at the operational meetings of the group on more than one 
occasion.  I  have  already  indicated  that  the  crown  has  emphasised  the 
involvement of the Stoke three in the larger group, in its free discussion of the 
 
plans of all of them, including plans for immediate terrorist action in the UK 
 
and its continuing function for discussion of possible course of action. I have 
already  referred  to  the  fact  that,  within  the  Stoke  group,  there  was  some 
 
consideration of a violent terrorist attack by way of bombing certain pubs in 
the  UK.  In  my  judgment  it  would  be  artificial  to  separate  off  the  madrassa 
project  from  the  gravamen  of  the  section  5  charge  namely  planning  and 
intending to pursue that project from within and with the support of the larger 
group  which  was  coalescing  and  of  which  I  am  satisfied  there  was  an 
emerging structure with the Stoke offenders in the pre-eminent position.  

 

 

13
--------
48. Accordingly I will determine the length of sentence for each of counts 9 and 
10  on  the  footing  that  they  are  of  equal  seriousness  and  that  the  individual 
levels of sentence must reflect the positions of the offender within and across 
the three groups. 

Count 9 
 

 
49. The  conduct  particularised  in  this  count  is  that,  with  the  intention  of 
committing an act or acts of terrorism or assisting others to do so, the three 
 
offenders  engaged  in  conduct  in  preparation  to  give  effect  to  that  intention 
namely  attending  operational  meetings,  fund  raising  for  terrorist  training, 
preparing  to  travel  abroad,  or  assisting  others  to  travel  abroad  to  engage  in 
training for acts of terrorism. 

 
50. The written basis of plea is that they were fund raising to build a Madrassa 
 
next to an already existing Mosque in Kashmir in Pakistan. The plan was to 
 
make that Madrassa available for men who would be fighting to bring Sharia 
to that region. Such people would receive firearms training at the Madrassa. It 
is  now  clear  that  the  plan  would  involve  Usman  Khan  and  Nazam  Hussain 
 
attending the Madrassa from early January for that purpose.  

 
51. The Crown’s position, which I accept, is that, whilst the Madrassa was in the 
early stages of construction, terrorist training there was already possible.  The 
Crown accepts that Shahjahan did not intent to travel to train but that Usman 
Khan and Nazam Hussain did as they were about to travel to Pakistan. Further, 
although it was contemplated that some of those trained would commit their 
acts of terrorism abroad, none the less, it was also contemplated others might 
 
return  to  the  UK  and  commit  them  in  the  UK  though  in  the  light  of 
experiences in Kashmir this might not have actually occurred.  

 

 
52. It is clear to me from the conversations within the group that Shahjahan was 
 
the leader, not only of the Stoke group, but was recognised by his own, and the 
other, groups as the leader of the larger group and to whom members of the 
other components deferred as “ameer”. It is also clear that the Stoke group saw 
itself as pre-eminent.  Shahjahan regarded the three Stoke offenders as almost 
 
on a par with him. 
 

  
53.  It  is  clear  to  me  that  Usman  Kahn  and  Nazan  Hussain  were  to  attend  the 
Madrassa and were themselves keen to perform acts of terrorism in Kashmir 
and that it was envisaged that when they and others, who had been recruited, 
had  also  trained  in  the  Madrassa  and  had  experience  in  Kashmir,  they  may 
return  to  the  UK  and  perform  acts  of  violent  terrorism  here.  The  long, 
monitored, discussions of Usman Khan about the madrassa and his attitudes 
towards  it  and  terrorism  are  highly  eloquent  of  the  seriousness  of  their 
purpose. It is clear that this was a serious, long term, venture in terrorism the 
 
purpose of which was to establish and manage a terrorist training facility at the 
 
Madrassa, to fundraise for its construction and operation by the use of various 
means, including fraud, and to recruit young British Muslims to go there and 
train,  thereafter  being  available  to  commit  terrorism  abroad  and  at  home. 
Added to this is the dimension of all of this being the subject of discussion at, 

14
--------
Usman Khan 
 

Nazam Hussain 
 

and their participation in, the larger group in which they were pre-eminent and 
of which Shahjahan was regarded as the ameer. 

Mohammed Shahjahan 
  

 
 
54. I have already indicated that in my judgment this offence is on the same level 
of seriousness as count 10. Placing it within the range of sentences in the cases 
to  which  I  have  already  referred,  in  my  judgment  the  starting  point  for 
Shahjahan as the leader of the Stoke group, which was the lead group of the 
 
three, is 22 years after a trial. In his case, whilst his previous convictions are 
relevant showing a disposition to commit serious crime, I do not regard them 
as  an  aggravating  factor.  Applying  a  20  %  discount  for  a  guilty  plea  the 
determinate sentence would be 17 years 8 months. I am sentencing him to an 
IPP so I must fix a minimum term which is 50% of that sentence. Accordingly 
he will not be considered for release on licence until 8 years 10 months have 
elapsed less days served on remand. 

 

 
55. In the case of Usman Khan, in my judgment he was marginally more central to 
 
the project than Nazam Hussain and marginally below Shahjahan. In addition, 
 
I must make a small reduction to reflect his youth. This results in a sentence 
after a trial of 20 years from which must be deducted 4 years as a discount for 
his plea of guilty. Thus the determinate sentence for him would be 16 years. I 
 
am imposing an IPP upon him and must fix the minimum term before which 
his release on licence cannot be considered. That is one half of the notional 
determinate sentence  namely 8 years less time served on remand. 

 

 
56. In the case of Nazam Hussain, in my judgment the starting point having regard 
to his place in the hierarchy, but without any reduction on the ground of his 
 
age,  is  20  years  after  a  trial.  As  with  Usman  Khan  he  is  entitled  to  a  20% 
discount  for  his  guilty  plea.  Thus  the  notional  determinate  sentence  is  16 
years.  I  have  to  fix  a  minimum  term  for  him  before  which  he  may  not  be 
considered  for  release  on  licence  from  this  sentence  of  IPP.  That  will  be  8 
 
years less time served on remand. 

 

Count 10 

 
57. It is a fundamental principle that a Court, in sentencing an offender, following 
a guilty plea, may only sentence him for the conduct of which he has pleaded 
guilty.  Count  10  particularises  the  offence  as  “preparing  to  produce  and 
detonate an explosive device in the London Stock Exchange”. The Crown, in 
opening the case, accepted that the device was to be a pipe bomb and that it 
 
was to be exploded in a toilet in the London Stock Exchange. The Crown also 
accept the offenders’ bases of plea that it was not their intention to cause death 
or serious injury but that it was their intention to cause terror, property damage 
 

15
--------
and economic damage. The offenders also accept that they were reckless as to 
whether it would in fact cause death or serious injury. 

 
58. The written basis of plea also accepts that it was the intention of the offenders 
that the plan would be carried out in the near future. There is no dispute but 
that, in the course of conversations and discussions relied on by the Crown, 
other projects of a similar nature were being considered but that only this one 
had  reached  the  stage  that  there  was  an  intention  to  commit  it  and  work  of 
 
preparation  had  commenced.  In  effect  the  others  had  been  abandoned  as 
impracticable ( the letter bombs) or had never been considered beyond being 
mentioned in passing. 

 
59. Whilst  it  is  true  that  no  materials  had  yet  been  obtained  with  a  view  to 
constructing  the  explosive  device,  and  that  no  firm  date  had  been  set,  the 
ingredients for such a device are simple and easily obtainable and, although 
the device requires some dexterity to construct, it does not require any expert 
knowledge or training other than basic manual dexterity and a familiarisation 
with basic electronic principles.  

 
 
 
60. The  Crown  points  out  that  this  is  the  first  case  in  which  a  case  falls  for 
 
sentencing where the involvement of Al Qaeda is in the form of inspiring the 
offenders through the medium of Inspire magazine. These offenders have no 
training. Their involvement in violent terrorism, it seems, is limited to a few 
weeks. They are, in effect, “lone wolf” terrorists, operating alone or in small 
 
groups  without  direct  contact  with,  or  logistical  support  from,  Al  Qaeda 
centre. The information provided on line by Al Qaeda is designed so as to be 
 
used  by  such  untrained  people.  This  reduces  the  potency  of  the  device 
involved but also reduces the chances of detection and increases the chances 
of success. The device in question is designed to be made within a few hours 
 
and  with  the  use  of  little  skill,  using  materials  that  can  be  acquired  without 
suspicion and must, to achieve its terrorising purpose, be capable of causing 
death. In order to have impact, a relatively small device such as this, must be 
placed in a high profile target and that was what was planned here.  

 
 
61. The Crown acknowledges that inevitably, with this new Al Quaeda  	tactic, this 
 
plan lacks the usual features of a serious terrorist plot that is, large, complex 
bombs, 
terrorist  organisation,  complex 
advanced planning. This is of necessity, because spontaneity and practicality 
are part of the new tactic. 

in  an  established 

involvement 

 
 
62. I have, therefore, to attempt to place sentence for this particular offence at a 
point on a spectrum which runs from 30 years (Karim & Jalil) to as low as 8 
(Tabbakh).  I  have  to  have  regard  to  the  fact  that  these  offenders  were  only 
engaged in discussing and planning for terrorist activities for a relatively brief 
 
period before the security forces intervened and that they intended to plant a 
small explosive device, with lethal potentiality, in a toilet at the London Stock 
Exchange, a high profile target chosen to maximise the terrorising effect and 
economic  impact.  I  also  have  to  have  regard  to  the  fact  that  none  of  the 
offenders  are  trained  and  were,  in  fact,  novices  who  had  not  devised  or, 

16
--------
apparently,  considered  any  strategy  to  gain  entry  to  the  London  Stock 
Exchange with the device. 

 
63. On  the  other  hand  I  have  to  reflect  the  fact  that  they  were  determined  to 
 
embark  on  violent  terrorist  action  and  had  given  serious  consideration  to  a 
number of options before homing in on this one. They had deliberately chosen 
a high profile target and they were reckless as to the damage and/or death and 
or  injury  which  might  be  caused.  They  were  responding  to  a  specific  new 
tactic being deployed by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsular and were steeped 
in the philosophy of that organisation.  

 
 
 
64. In  my  judgment,  for  all  these  reasons  this  offence  is  not  as  grave  as  the 
offences in Jalil and Karim.  But is of a different order of seriousness to that 
 
of Tabbakh. 
  

Abdul Miah 

 
65. In formal terms, Abdul Miah was the leader of the Cardiff group and so, in the 
structure chart, put on a par with Chowdhury. However, it is clear to me, as it 
was to the Stoke group, that he was a more serious jihadi than Chowdhury. It 
is clear from his contribution to discussions on 28th November, and on other 
 
occasions,  that  he  was,  by  virtue  of  his  maturity,  criminal  nowse  and 
experience, and personality, the one who was setting the agenda and applying 
an analytical mind to the feasibility of the various projects being discussed. He 
also took the lead in discussing fundraising by use of frauds which particularly 
impressed the Stoke group. He was also advising the others on security with 
his own experience to the fore and was their spokesman when dealing, on 28th 
  
November,  with  a  third  party.  In  addition,  it  is  clear  that,  by  the  12th 
 
December,  he  had  impressed  the  Stoke  contingent  with  his  seriousness  and 
capabilities as a jihadi and he had already mastered the elements of making the 
pipe bomb. Abdul Miah is a man of previous convictions. He has a number of 
convictions  and  has  served  a  significant  custodial  sentence.  Some  of  his 
convictions  evidence  him  as  a  person  with  an  inclination  towards  violence 
 
towards people, notably his convictions in respect of noxious gases and false 
 
imprisonment.  In  addition  he  has  a  recent  conviction  for  fraud  which  is 
apposite  to  his  contributions  to  discussions  about  fundraising  using  fraud. 
Those  previous  convictions,  in  my  judgment,  constitute  a  significant 
aggravating element. Having regard to all of these matters, in my judgment, 
the appropriate starting point after a trial for this offender is one of 21 years 
imprisonment. From that must be deducted 4.2 years in respect of a discount 
for his plea of guilty. This results in a sentence of 16 years and 10 months  to 
 
which will be added a 5 year extended term. Accordingly, the sentence I pass 
is  an  extended  sentence  of  21  years  and  10  months  of  which  the  custodial 
element is 16 years and 10 months.  

Mohammed Chowdhury 

17
--------
66. He was 20 years old at the time of this offence of no previous conviction. He 
 
was  however,  he  accepts,  the  lynchpin,  bringing  the  groups  together  and 
arranging  for  the  meetings  in  Cardiff  and  Newport.  He  was  one  of  the  four 
 
who discussed, on the 28th November, and eventually fixed on, this particular 
act  and  he  was  taking  the  lead  on  19th  December  in  explaining  and  going 
through the Inspire article with Shah Rahman. After a trial and giving him a 
 
small discount for his youth in comparison to the others a sentence of 17 years 
 
would  have,  in  my  judgment,  been  appropriate  given  his  role  and  position 
within the London group and across the three groups. Giving him credit for his 
guilty  plea  of  20%.  a  sentence  of  13  years  and  eight  months  would,  in  my 
 
judgment,  be  appropriate.  However,  in  view  of  my  assessment  of  him  as 
 
dangerous, the sentence I pass upon him is an extended sentence of 18 years 8 
months, of which the custodial sentence element is 13 years 8 months. 

Shah Rahman 

  
67.  I take into account that Shah Rahman is accepted as not being the leader of 
the  London  element  of  this  group.  Nor  does  his  minor  offence,  committed 
during  the  time  of  this  indictment,  aggravate  his  guilt  His  involvement  was 
less prominent than that of Chowdhury and it was clear that he was a follower, 
not a prime mover, when they were together on the 28th November, and when 
they were discussing recipes on the 19th December. To reflect that element, in 
my judgment the starting point for him is 15 years after a trial. Giving him a 
discount for his plea of guilty the sentence I would have passed, but for the 
issue of dangerousness, is one of  12 years imprisonment, to which I add an 
extended sentence element of 5 years. Accordingly, the sentence on him is an 
 
extended prison sentence of 17 years of which the custodial sentence element 
is 12 years. 

 

Gurukanth Desai 
 

 
68. It  is  agreed  that  Desai  is  not  a  leader  of  the  Cardiff  group.  He  played  a 
subordinate role in that group. He has previous convictions but they are long 
 
ago  and  trivial  and  so  I  do  not  regard  hem  as  an  aggravating  feature.  His 
contribution is, in my judgment, no greater than that of Shah Rahman. In his 
case  the  starting  point  after  a  trial  would  be  a  sentence  of  15  years  which, 
giving a discount for his plea of guilty, reduces to 12 years, added to which 
 
must  be  a  5  year  extended  term  which  results  in  his  case  in  an  extended 
sentence of 17 years of which the custodial element will be 12 years. 

Count 12 
 
Omar Latif 

 
69. The particulars of this count are that Omar Latif, with the intention of assisting 
others to commit an act of terrorism, engaged in conduct in preparation for an 
act of terrorism by travelling to and attending meetings on 7th November and 
12th December.  

18
--------
70. I have already referred to his basis of plea. He was present at those meetings. 
He  was  aware  that  conversations  concerning  terrorist  activity  were  likely  to 
 
take place and that such conversations did. But he did not participate in the 
development of any plans of a terrorist nature including those relating to the 
Stock Exchange or terrorist training in Pakistan.  

 
 
71. In my judgment, the gravamen of the offence committed by Latif is that on 
more  than  one  occasion  he  travelled  to  and  attended  such  meetings  well 
knowing  the  nature  of  the  conversations  to  take  place.  That  is  to  say,  their 
wide ranging nature, the number of possible terrorist activities which would be 
discussed and the intention of their participants that they would crystallise into 
a plan or plans to carry out at least one, if not more, terrorist acts of the type of 
severity being discussed. 

 
 
72. Whilst his conduct with the intention of assisting others to commit an act of 
 
terrorism did not involve participation in the planning of or development of 
either of the plans which crystallised during those and other meetings, none 
the  less,  by  his  presence  at  those  meetings,  he  was  contributing  by 
encouraging the others to form the intention to commit those terrorist acts and 
to  prepare  for  them.  As  such,  I  accept  that  his  culpability  is  not  as  great  as 
theirs.  But,  he  was  a  trusted  member  of  what  was,  to  an  extent,  a  self 
 
consciously  exclusive  group  who,  by  his  plea  to  count  12,  shared  their 
intention that an act or acts of terrorism should be planned and prepared. I do 
not accept that the authorities he relies on are, save for Tabbakh, to which I 
have already referred, relevant to this case. The gravamen of this case is the 
operation  of  the  group  and  his  membership  of  it  even  though  to  a  limited 
extent. 

 
 
73. In  my  judgment,  therefore,  and  in  the  particular  context  of  this  case,  the 
starting point for Omar Latif is a sentence of 13 years imprisonment which, 
after a discount for his plea of guilty, results in a custodial term of 10 years 
and 4 months to which must be added a 5 year extended term giving a total 
 
extended sentence of 15 years 4 months of which the custodial term element is 
10 years 4 months. 

Count 11 
 
Mohibur Rahman 

74. This  charges  Mohibur  Rahman  that  on  the  20th  December  2010  he  was  in 
 
possession  of  articles:  namely  Inspire  magazine  Summer  and  Fall  2010,  in 
 
circumstances which gave rise to a reasonable suspicion that their possession 
was for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation 
of an act of terrorism. His plea of guilty is on the basis that he did indeed have 
these  magazines  on  a  hard  drive  in  his  possession  for  several  months  since 
September 2010, though they were not accessed on that hard drive after the 
16th  October  2010.  The  Crown  say  that  this  possession  by  him  of  these 
articles must be seen in the context of his attendance at the Cardiff meeting on 
the 7th November along with the other Stoke defendants, his being referred to 

19
--------
by other defendants at the 12th December meeting, though he was not present, 
and his presence in discussions about a pub bomb on the 14th December with 
Usman Khan and Shahjahan, though no plan in respect of that discussions ever 
 
crystallised.  

 

 
 
75. The  potency  of  these  two  magazines,  which  were  on  his  hard  drive,  is  best 
illustrated by the direct use to which the London and Cardiff offenders put it in 
respect  of  Count  10..  The  prosecution  say  that  the  context  of  his,  albeit 
limited, involvement in the group makes the possession of such articles all the 
more significant and serious. 

 
 
76. The  maximum  sentence  for  the  Section  57  offence  is  now  15  years  having 
been raised from 10 years in 2006. There have been a number decisions of the 
 
CACD in connection with this offence to which I have been referred, though 
in this area of offending cases are highly fact specific.  

 
 
77. In my judgment the commission of this offence by this offender, in the context 
of the activities of this group and his connections with it, places his offence at 
a significant level of seriousness. Had there been a trial and he been convicted 
the appropriate sentence would have been one of 6 1/2 years imprisonment. 
 
Giving credit of 20% for his plea of guilty, that sentence is reduced to one of 5 
years. 

 
78. I do not accept the argument that he was pleading guilty to a new allegation so 
as to attract a greater discount for a plea of guilty. The allegation was already 
on  the  indictment  in  the  form  of  count  8,  a  section  58  offence.  He  never 
offered to plead guilty to that offence. His late plea to the same facts recast as 
 
a section 57 offence cannot, in my judgment, constitute a plea of guilty at the 
first available opportunity. In his case he will be released after he has served 
 
half  of  that  term  less  time  served  on  remand  and  for  the  balance  of  the 
sentence will be at risk of recall if he were to breach he terms of his licence or 
were to commit a further offence. 

 

 
79. Finally I have considered all the personal mitigation and references urged on 
me. I am afraid that in this case they are very marginal to my task and none of 
it has affected my sentences to any significant degree.

Sentencing Remarks of Mr Justice Treacy 
 

The Offence 
 

1.  The murder of Stephen Lawrence on the night of 22nd April 1993 was a 
terrible and evil crime. Recently the Lord Chief Justice described it as a 
“murder which scarred the conscience of the nation.”  

2.  A totally innocent 18 year old youth on the threshold of a promising life was 
 
brutally cut down in the street in front of eye witnesses by a racist thuggish 
gang. You were both members of that gang. I have no doubt at all that you 
fully subscribed to its views and attitudes. The covert Footscray DVD with its 
disgusting and shocking scenes and the nature of the attack itself convince 
me of that. 

3.  This crime was committed for no other reason than racial hatred. You did not 

know Stephen Lawrence or Duwayne Brooks. Neither of them had done 
anything to harm, threaten or offend you in any way, apart from being black 
and making their way peaceably to the bus-stop on their way home. 

4.  At least one of your group was armed with a lethal knife that night. I am sure 

you were aware of that. The Footscray tapes, although recorded in 1994, 
reveal the sort of people you were and associated with in 1993. They reveal 
not only violent racist attitudes but also a casual and accepting attitude to the 
carrying and use of knives. They reveal a group acceptance of the use of 
knives to threaten or harm black people. 

5.  The brief but co-ordinated nature of the attack by your group confirms that 

view. A racist taunt, followed by a group charge towards the two young black 
men, and then the swallowing up of Stephen Lawrence, surrounded and put 
 
to the ground by all of you, shows a deliberately concerted attack. A knife was 
used to stab him with blows aimed to vulnerable parts of the body: once when 
he was upright at the start of the attack; the second when he was on the
--------
ground whilst the rest of you were gathered round aiming blows or kicks to put 
him or keep him on the ground. 

6.  The evidence does not prove so that I could be sure that either of you had a 
knife, but the person who used it did so with your knowledge and approval. 
That is apparent from the brief nature of the attack in which those who were 
unarmed did not themselves inflict blows or kicks of sufficient gravity to leave 
injury or involve themselves in a sustained attack as they would if this was a 
conventional plan to beat up. The attack lasted in the region of 10 seconds 
and then the whole group moved off together as one making its escape. I take 
the view that, in the circumstances, it does not matter that the knife was not in 
your hands.  

7.  The cohesive nature of the group tells its story. It is not as if, for example, one 
person unexpectedly did something that no one else expected or approved of. 
You, Dobson, repeatedly lied to keep Norris’ name away from the police, a 
clear example of group loyalty.  

8.  Whilst the attack on Stephen Lawrence himself clearly could not have been 
pre-meditated since it was a chance encounter, I cannot accept that a crime 
of this type simply arose on the spur of the moment. The way in which the 
attack took place strongly suggests to me that your group, if not actively 
seeking out a victim, was prepared, if opportunity arose, to attack in the way 
in which you did.  

9.  Stephen Lawrence is not the only victim of this crime. His family, (two parents, 

a brother and a sister), whose victim impact statements I have read, have 
been most grievously affected. So has his friend Duwayne Brooks. Of that I 
have no doubt. 

10.Neither of you has shown the slightest regret or remorse. Each of you has lied 

to the court. I do not punish you for that, but this is not a case where there is 
any mitigation available for contrition. 

11.As to other potential mitigation, it is urged upon me that I should make 

allowance on the basis that this was a murder involving an intention to cause 
grievous bodily harm rather than an intention to kill. That is a recognised 
mitigating factor. However in this case it is not a factor to which I can attach 
much weight although I accord it some. The reasons for this are that (i) there 
was premeditation in the sense I have explained, (ii) the carrying and use of a 
deadly weapon was part of what was contemplated, (iii) even if you did not 
positively intend death to result, you intended very serious injury and were in 
reality utterly indifferent as to whether death resulted or not, (iv) death was an 
obvious risk in this sort of attack. This is not a case where the division 
between the two forms of intent is a wide one. Accordingly, the weight to be 
attached is not great. See R v PETERS [2005] EWCA Crim 605 at paragraphs 
13-16.
--------
12.You are both now in your mid 30’s but I have to look at you as you were at the 

time of the crime. Both of you were undoubtedly streetwise at the time of the 
December 1994 Footscray tapes. I believe they reflect how you were in 1993. 
There is nothing I have seen or been told which suggests to me that either of 
you was particularly immature, easily led or otherwise disadvantaged in April 
1993. There is no suggestion that psychiatric or other reports are needed for 
either of you. 

Sentencing Framework 
 

13.The sentencing framework is clear. All parties, after consideration of the 
relevant legal provisions are agreed. In short, the law dictates that I must 
sentence you by reference to your age and maturity at the time of the crime. I 
cannot sentence you as the mature men you now are. In addition I must 
sentence you in accordance with the practice in force before the coming into 
force of Schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 which now governs 
sentencing for more modern murders. 

14.In modern times an adult committing this crime would be facing a life 

sentence with a starting point for a minimum term of around 30 years. That is 
the effect of the provisions of Schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. 
That same Act by contrast fixes the starting point for sentencing where the 
offender was under 18 at the time of committing the offence at 12 years.  

15.I am also required by Schedule 22 Paragraph 10(a) of the same Act not to 

pass a heavier penalty than would have been imposed before that Act came 
into force. So, I must follow sentencing practice as it was before the 2003 Act. 
As is made clear by the Consolidated Criminal Practice Direction [2004] 
1WLR 2251, (issued by the then Lord Chief Justice and dealing with 
sentencing for murders committed before 18th December 2003), the starting 
point for an adult for an offence of this type would be around 15/16 years.  

16.It may be, therefore, that the resultant sentences are lower than some might 

expect, but the law as laid down by Parliament must be applied and I am 
constrained by it. 

The Sentences 
 

17.I will of course apply the law faithfully, but recognising that it is for the trial 

judge to determine the period he considers appropriate within the legal 
framework and guidance. See S 269 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. 

18.The gravity of this case is in my view of a different order from, for example, a 
murder committed by one individual upon another as a result of some sudden 
quarrel. There was a degree of general premeditation; it was a racist crime 
driven by hatred; it involved a gang of like-minded attackers; a lethal weapon
--------
was employed and known in advance to be carried; the victim was completely 
blameless and helpless. The high level of public interest in this case is at least 
in part a reflection of the abhorrence felt by right-thinking people at the nature 
of this crime. This, too, should be reflected in the sentence.  

19.This is an offence which calls for an upward adjustment in the starting point 

because of the aggravating features referred to above. Such an increase is in 
line with observations in R v SULLIVAN and Others [2004] EWCA Crim 1762, 
and R v PETERS (Supra). In this case, were an adult involved and facing 
sentence for this crime based on pre-2003 Act sentencing practice, I would 
envisage a minimum term of around 18 years. I must, however, reflect the fact 
that both of you were under 18 at the time. I shall adopt a starting point of 12 
years and then adjust it to reflect the aggravating features and such mitigation 
as exists in you cases. 

20.In each case, and as a reflection of the fact that the offender was under 18 at 

the time, I must impose a sentence of Detention at Her Majesty’s Pleasure. 
See S 90 Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000. This form of 
sentence is, for practical purposes, the same as a life sentence passed on an 
adult. See S 277 Criminal Justice Act 2003. 

21.Next, I must fix the minimum term to be served in each case. This is the 
period which must be served before an offender can be released by the 
Parole Board. This is a real-time period and is not reduced in the way that 
ordinary sentences of imprisonment are. It is what it says, a minimum term of 
 
the length stated. There is no guarantee of release once the term is served. 
An offender will only be released if, on the basis of a stringent assessment by 
the Parole Board at that time, he is deemed no longer to pose a risk to the 
public. Otherwise he will remain in prison. 

22.After release, whenever that is, an offender is not free of his sentence. He will 
remain subject to licence for the rest of his life and may be recalled to prison 
at any time. 

23.Gary Dobson, you are now 36; at 17 years and 10 months you were very 

nearly 18 when you murdered Stephen Lawrence. You are serving a 5 year 
sentence for drug supply offences. It would be unjust to grant you credit for 
any time spent in custody awaiting trial on this matter. I therefore decline to 
grant you any credit for time already spent in custody pursuant to S 240 of the 
Criminal Justice Act 2003. In addition, there is no just reason why you should 
be able effectively to write off the remainder of the custodial element of the 
drug supply sentence, so I will increase the minimum term for this offence to 
prevent you receiving an undeserved benefit. I take note of two positive 
reports from HMP Belmarsh. 

24.Taking account of all the circumstances referred to above, the sentence of the 
court for the murder of Stephen Lawrence is one of Detention at Her Majesty’s 
Pleasure. I specify a minimum term to be served of 15 years and 2 months.
--------
25.David Norris, you are now 35 years old. You were 16 years and 8 months old 
at the time of the offence. Since 1993 you have been in trouble for dishonesty 
and in 2002 you received 12 months imprisonment for Racially Threatening 
Words or Behaviour. This confirms my view, (and no doubt that of the jury), 
that you were a violent racist in 1993. 

26.You were just over a year younger than Dobson. I shall make allowance for 
that in fixing the minimum term, but not a great deal since there is nothing to 
suggest that you were anything other than a full member of your gang with 
any age differences being less relevant than the fact of membership, 
participation and identification with its aims. I do not regard delay as a 
mitigating factor. That, and hostility towards yourself and your family, arises 
from your own actions. 

27.Taking account of all the circumstances in your case, the sentence of the 

court for the murder of Stephen Lawrence is one of Detention at Her Majesty’s 
Pleasure. I specify a minimum term to be served of 14 years and 3 months. 
Pursuant to S 240 Criminal Justice Act 2003, I direct that 483 days 
representing all time spent on remand since 9th September 2010 be credited 
towards the minimum term. Any arithmetical error may be corrected 
administratively.",2012-01-04 00:00:00,UK Crown Court

5. 

On 22nd April 1993 just after 10.35 in the evening, a young man, Stephen Lawrence, 
then 18 years old, was waiting at a bus stop at Eltham with a close friend of the same 
age, Duwayne Brooks.  As they waited peacefully for the bus, a group of white youths 
crossed the road towards them.  One of the youths used abusive racist language. This 
was  followed  by  a  sudden  and  immediate  attack,  as  the  group  converged  on  or 
charged  at  them.    Duwayne  Brooks  managed  to  make  his  escape,  but  Stephen 
Lawrence was felled.  He was stabbed twice to the upper torso, one wound tracked 
vertically downwards from 10cm to the right of the mid line, and the second tracked 
more or less horizontally, but in an upward direction, from the outer aspect of the left 
shoulder. Major blood vessels were severed.  The injuries were fatal.  The position 
and angle of the wounds suggested that the torso may have been upright at the time 
when  the  knife  wounds  were  inflicted.  Apart  from  the  stabbing  wounds,  the  only 
further injuries noted at post mortem were an incised injury to the left side of the chin 
and  abrasions  to  the  cheek  and  the  back  of  the  right  hand.    Mortally  wounded, 
Stephen Lawrence managed to get to his feet. He ran after Duwayne Brooks, but after 
a little while, he collapsed on the pavement. He died shortly afterwards in hospital.   

The murder of Stephen Lawrence, a young black man of great promise, targeted and 
killed by a group of white youths just because of the colour of his skin was indeed a 
calamitous crime.    

Stephen  Lawrence’s  parents  began  a  private  prosecution  and,  in  April  1996,  Gary 
Dobson, Luke Knight and Neil Acourt were tried for murder at the Central Criminal 
Court  before  Curtis  J  and  a  jury.    Following  the  judge’s  ruling  that  purported 
identification evidence was not admissible, there was insufficient further evidence to 
justify  the  continuation  of  the  prosecution.    The  jury  was  directed  to  acquit  the 
defendants. Not guilty verdicts were entered . 

This  is  an  application  by  the  prosecution  for  the  acquittal  of  Gary  Dobson  to  be 
quashed and for a re-trial to be ordered under section 76 of the Criminal Justice Act 
2003.    No  application  to  quash  the  acquittals  of  Neil  Acourt  and  Luke  Knight  is 
before  the  court,  but  another  suspect,  who  was  not  a  defendant  at  the  earlier  trial, 
David Norris, was arrested in September 2010 and charged with murder.  His trial will 
take place at the Central Criminal Court in November 2011.  If the acquittal of Gary 
Dobson is quashed and a re-trial ordered, the prosecution propose that he and David 
Norris will be tried together. 

The statutory criteria 

Until  Part  10  of  the  Criminal  Justice  Act  2003  (the  2003  Act)  came  into  force  the 
ancient  rule  against  double  jeopardy  represented  an  insuperable  barrier  to  a  second 
prosecution  of  any  of  those  acquitted  at  the  Central  Criminal  Court  in  April  1996.  
The rule has been subject to limited statutory abrogation in relation to a number of 
qualifying offences, of which murder is one.

Section 78 of the 2003 Act provides: 

“(1)  The requirements of this section are met if there is new 
and compelling evidence against the acquitted person…

(2)  Evidence is new if it was not adduced in the proceedings in 

which the person was acquitted… 

(3)  Evidence is compelling if – 

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

it is reliable, 

it is substantial, and 

in the context of the outstanding issues, it appears highly 
probative of the case against the acquitted person. 

7. 

8. 

(4)   The  outstanding  issues  are  the  issues  in  dispute  in  the  proceedings  in 

which the person was acquitted…” 

Thus “compelling evidence” for the purposes of section 78 is defined in the section 
itself.  It does not mean that the evidence must be irresistible, or that absolute proof of 
guilt is required.  In other words, the court should not and is certainly not required to 
usurp the function of the jury, or, if a new trial is ordered, to indicate to the jury what 
the verdict should be.  Our attention has been drawn to the observations of the Vice 
President, Lord Justice Hughes, in R v (G), B (S) [2009] EWCA Crim 1207 where the 
proposed new evidence, of a co-accused who had been convicted at the original trial, 
did not satisfy the test of reliability.  At para 5 of the abbreviated judgment, the Vice 
President observed that it is “only where there is compelling new evidence of guilt, of 
the kind which cannot realistically be disputed, that the exceptional step of quashing 
an acquittal will be justified”.  The purpose of this observation, as para 9 makes clear, 
was to highlight that the quashing of an acquittal is an exceptional step, which indeed 
it is, and can only be ordered if the statutory requirement in relation to the “reliability” 
of the new evidence is clearly established. 

However  the  legislative  structure  does  not  suggest  that  availability  of  a  realistic 
defence argument which may serve to undermine the reliability or probative value of 
the new evidence must, of itself, preclude an order quashing the acquittal.  It must, of 
course, be carefully analysed, and given its proper weight.  If the argument, or indeed 
any defence evidence, leads the court to conclude that the new evidence is not, after 
all, as reliable or substantial as it was thought to be, or that it no longer appears to be 
highly probative of guilt, then the court cannot be satisfied that the statutory test has 
been  met.    That  is  a  fact  specific  decision.    In  the  end,  there  are  three  defined 
elements: provided the new evidence is reliable, substantial, and appears to be highly 
probative, for the purposes of section 78 it is compelling: otherwise it is not.  

9. 

Section 79 of the 2003 Act addresses the separate question which arises once the court 
is satisfied that new and compelling evidence as defined by section 78 is available. It  
provides: 

“(1)  The  requirements  of  this  section  are  met  if  in  all  the 
circumstances  it  is  in  the  interests  of  justice  for  the  court  to 
make the order… 

(2)  That  question  is  to  be  determined  having  regard  in 

particular to –

whether existing circumstance make a fair trial unlikely; 

for  the  purposes  of  that  question  and  otherwise,  the 
length of time since the qualifying offence was allegedly 
committed; 

whether  it  is  likely  that  the  new  evidence  would  have 
been  adduced  in  the  earlier  proceedings  against  the 
acquitted person but for a failure by an officer or by a 
prosecutor to act with due diligence or expedition. 

whether,  since  those  proceedings  or,  if  later,  since  the 
commencement  of  this  Part,  any  officer  or  prosecutor 
has failed to act with due diligence or expedition. 

(3)  … 

(4)  Where the earlier prosecution was conducted by a person other than a 
prosecutor, sub-section (2)(c) applies in relation to that person as well as 
in relation to a prosecutor.” 

The interests of justice test requires attention to be focussed on the express statutory 
criteria  provided  in  section  79,  but  these  criteria,  although  wide  ranging,  are  not 
exhaustive.  They  are  partly  directed  to  events  during  the  original  investigative  and 
trial process, a requirement designed to avoid delay in the administration of justice as 
well as inefficiency and lack of direction which might result from a perception that 
what we shall describe as a second bite of the cherry may eventually become available 
to the prosecution.  Thus if the new evidence relied on by the prosecution would have 
been  revealed  for  use  at  the  first  trial  by  a  competent  investigative  and/or 
prosecutorial process, then the interests of justice may, on this ground alone, lead to 
the application being refused.  The interests of justice have also to be addressed in the 
context of the date when any new trial may take place, with particular emphasis on 
any failure of due diligence or expedition since the original trial and on the impact of 
any  delay  (whether  culpable  or  not)  on  the  fairness  of  the  proposed  second  trial.  
However compelling the new evidence may be, it is elementary that any second trial 
should be a fair one.  For this purpose the court will examine all the known facts, and 
consider  any  material  drawn  to  its  attention  on  behalf  of  the  potential  defendant, 
including any potentially prejudicial publicity attracted by the case, which may make 
it “unlikely” that a fair trial can take place. 

If this court is satisfied that the requirements of both sections 78 and 79 are met, the 
order must be made: otherwise the application must be dismissed (see s77).  In the 
context of the present application it should perhaps be highlighted that the legislative 
arrangements  which  abrogated  the  double  jeopardy  principle  make  no  distinction 
between an acquittal following a prosecution by the Crown in the usual way, or an 
acquittal  following  a  private  prosecution.    This  approach  to  the  legislation  is 
reinforced  by  the  continuing  power  of  the  Director  of  Public  Prosecutions  under 
section 6(2) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 to take over the conduct of a 
prosecution  begun  by  a  private  individual,  and  thereafter  to  serve  notice  of 
discontinuance, or alternatively, to ensure its more efficient conduct.  Accordingly in 
the  present  application  we  cannot  apply  any  less  stringent  test  to  the  legislative

requirements  merely  because  there  was  no  realistic  prospect  that  the  private 
prosecution would succeed. 

The present application depends on the reliability of new scientific evidence which by 
reference to the grey bomber jacket (LH/5) and the multi-coloured cardigan (ASR/2) 
closely links Dobson with the fatal attack on Stephen Lawrence.  It does not and could 
not  demonstrate  that  Dobson  wielded  the  knife  which  caused  the  fatal  wound,  but 
given the circumstances of the attack on Stephen Lawrence, that is, a group of youths 
in a violent enterprise converging on a young man, and attacking him as a group, it 
would  be  open  to  a  jury  to  conclude  that  any  one  of  those  who  participated  in  the 
attack was party to the killing and guilty of murder, or alternatively manslaughter (a 
verdict which would, if there had been sufficient evidence, also have been available at 
the first trial).  If reliable, the new scientific evidence would place Dobson in very 
close proximity indeed to Stephen Lawrence at the moment of and in the immediate 
aftermath of the attack, proximity, moreover, for which no innocent explanation can 
be discerned.   

On behalf of Dobson, Mr Timothy Roberts QC, in a meticulously careful submission 
submitted  that  this  evidence  is  unreliable  and  of  no  sufficient  probative  value,  just 
because the results of the new examination of Dobson’s clothing are likely to be the 
product of contamination over the years, that is, by contact with Stephen Lawrence’s 
blood  and  his  clothing.    On  this  basis,  even  if  scientific  evidence  is  reliable,  the 
apparent links are unconnected with Dobson’s presence and involvement at the scene, 
but rather the result of outdated or incompetent storage or packaging or transporting 
arrangements,  and  therefore  they  are  not  probative  at  all,  and  certainly  not  highly 
probative.  

14.  Mr Roberts further highlighted that even if there was sufficient evidence to link his 
client with presence at the scene of the killing of Stephen Lawrence, it was unlikely 
that after the huge wave of constant publicity over the years, directly identifying some 
of those suspected of the murder with involvement in the crime, be a fair trial.  The 
constant stream of adverse publicity will make it impossible for the jury to approach 
their responsibilities with the necessary level of open mindedness and fairness.  There 
would be prejudice, either actual prejudice, or unconscious prejudice.  

After conducting a detailed examination of a large body of evidence we have come to 
the conclusion that there is sufficient reliable and substantial new evidence to justify 
the quashing of the acquittal and to order a new trial.  This decision means, and we 
emphasise  that  it  means  no  more  than  that  the  question  whether  Dobson  had  any 
criminal  involvement  in  Stephen  Lawrence’s  death  must  be  considered  afresh  by  a 
new jury which will examine the evidence and decide whether the allegation against 
him is proved.  The presumption of innocence continues to apply.   

Our decision in relation to publicity is based on the material we have seen.  The way 
in which publicity should be given to this judgment and indeed the subsequent trial 
must now be governed by the fact that there is indeed to be a new trial of a defendant 
who, we repeat, is presumed in law to be innocent.  The proceedings are now active 
for the purposes of section 2 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981, and care should be 
taken  to  ensure  that  any  further  reporting  of  this  case  must  avoid  any  risk  to  the 
administration  of  public  justice  and  the  fairness  of  the  forthcoming  trial.    It  would

The Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales: 

Introduction 
   

 

On 22nd April 1993, just after 10.35 in the evening, a young man, Stephen Lawrence, 
then 18 years old, was waiting at a bus stop at Eltham with a close friend of the same 
 
age, Duwayne Brooks.  As they waited peacefully for the bus, a group of white youths 
 
crossed the road towards them.  One of the youths used abusive racist language. This 
was  followed  by  a  sudden  and  immediate  attack,  as  the  group  converged  on  or 
charged  at  them.    Duwayne  Brooks  managed  to  make  his  escape,  but  Stephen 
Lawrence was felled.  He was stabbed twice to the upper torso: one wound tracked 
vertically downwards from 10cm to the right of the mid line, and the second tracked 
more or less horizontally, but in an upward direction, from the outer aspect of the left 
 
shoulder. Major blood vessels were severed.  The injuries were fatal.  The position 
and angle of the wounds suggested that Stephen Lawrence was likely to have been 
upright when the wound to the right side was inflicted, but may have been lying on 
the ground when stabbed on the left shoulder. Apart from the stabbing wounds, the 
only further injuries noted at post mortem were an incised injury to the left side of the 
 
chin and abrasions to the cheek and the back of the right hand.  Mortally wounded, 
Stephen Lawrence managed to get to his feet. He ran after Duwayne Brooks, but after 
 
a little while, he collapsed on the pavement. He died shortly afterwards in hospital.   

The murder of Stephen Lawrence, a young black man of great promise, targeted and 
killed by a group of white youths just because of the colour of his skin, scarred the 
conscience of the nation.  This was indeed a calamitous crime, and to date no one has 
been convicted of involvement in it.   

Stephen  Lawrence’s  parents  began  a  private  prosecution  and,  in  April  1996,  Gary 
Dobson, Luke Knight and Neil Acourt were tried for murder at the Central Criminal 
 
Court  before  Curtis  J  and  a  jury.    Following  the  judge’s  ruling  that  purported 
identification evidence was not admissible, there was insufficient further evidence to 
justify  the  continuation  of  the  prosecution.    The  jury  was  directed  to  acquit  the 
defendants. Not guilty verdicts were entered . 

This  is  an  application  by  the  prosecution  for  the  acquittal  of  Gary  Dobson  to  be 
quashed and for a re-trial to be ordered under section 76 of the Criminal Justice Act 
2003.  No  application  to  quash  the  acquittals  of  Neil  Acourt  and  Luke  Knight  is 
 
before  the  court,  but  another  suspect,  who  was  not  a  defendant  at  the  earlier  trial, 
David Norris, was arrested in September 2010 and charged with murder.  His trial will 
take place at the Central Criminal Court in November 2011.  If the acquittal of Gary 
Dobson is quashed and a re-trial ordered, the prosecution propose that he and David 
Norris will be tried together. 

The Background 

Within  a  few  hours  of  the  attack  on  Stephen  Lawrence,  the  police  received 
 
anonymous telephone calls and letters which suggested that members of a group of 
white  youths  were  responsible.  Five  suspects  -  Neil  Acourt,  Jamie  Acourt,  Luke 
 
Knight, David Norris, and Gary Dobson  – were identified.  Dobson (as we shall, for 
 
convenience, hereafter refer to him) was then 17 years old.  He was living with his 
 
parents at 13 Phineas Pett Road in Eltham, very close to the scene of the murder.   For

present purposes the physical description of the suspects is irrelevant.  Arrests were 
postponed  until  a  number  of  inquiries  had  been  pursued  in  an  endeavour  to  gather 
what the police regarded as real or hard evidence against the suspects.  This decision 
was later the subject of considerable criticism. 
   

During house-to-house inquiries on 25th April, Dobson told the police that from about 
5.30pm he had been at home throughout the evening of 22nd April.  On the basis of 
his own later admission that was untrue.   

With the police under pressure to make progress, in May and June 1993, at various 
times, five suspects were arrested.  When Dobson was arrested a number of items of 
clothing were seized from his home.  These included a distinctive grey, sometimes 
called  grey/yellow,  bomber  jacket  which  was  recovered  from  his  bedroom,  (LH/5) 
and  a  multi  coloured  Marks  and  Spencer  cardigan  found  in  the  wardrobe  in  his 
parents’ bedroom. (ASR/2)  Although the delayed arrest impacted on the strategies 
 
adopted by the scientists when they received these two items of clothing in October 
 
1993,  scientific  evidence  relating  to  them  is  now  the  critical  feature  in  the  present 
application. It will be addressed in detail later in this judgment.   

Following his arrest, Dobson was interviewed under caution.  He told the police that 
on 22nd April he had left his house at about 11.45pm after his parents had gone to bed 
 
to  go  round  to  the  home  of  Neil  and  Jamie  Acourt  to  pick  up  a  Bob  Marley  CD. 
While he was there another young man, Mattie White, arrived, and told them all that a 
boy had been murdered.  When he was asked why he had not told the police on 25th 
 
April that he had been out that night to the home of the Acourts, he responded that he 
“didn’t  find  it  necessary…”,  adding  “I  know  I  should  have  now”.    In  interview  he 
denied knowing David Norris. He accounted for the grey “bomber jacket”, saying it 
 
had been given to him some years before, but that it was “miles” too big for him and 
that  neither  he,  nor  anyone  else,  had  worn  it  for  ages.    That  assertion,  too,  is  now 
called into question by the scientific evidence.  But at that stage of the inquiry, there 
was insufficient evidence to justify charging Dobson with any offence. 

Following  their  arrests,  Knight  and  Neil  Acourt  were  charged  with  the  murder  of 
 
Stephen  Lawrence,  after  each  of  them  was  identified  on  identification  parades  by 
 
Duwayne  Brooks  as  part  of  the  attacking  group  of  white  youths.    However  the 
reliability  of  these  identifications  was  called  into  serious  question.    On  any  view 
Brooks had found himself in a frightening situation, with only a brief opportunity for 
making  a  correct  identification  at  night,  under  artificial  light,  in  a  desperately  fast-
moving incident. Moreover, after he had identified Knight, he himself confirmed to an 
independent  police  officer  that  he  had  not  actually  seen  the  faces  of  any  of  the 
attacking group, but had been given a description of them before he took part in the 
parades.  Accordingly, the prosecution of Knight and Neil Acourt was discontinued. 
As to Dobson, he was never identified by anyone.

Thereafter,  notwithstanding 
Prosecution Service concluded that there was insufficient reliable evidence to justify 
any prosecutions arising out of the attack on Stephen Lawrence.

investigation, 

A second police investigation began in May/June 1994.   This investigation, in effect, 
followed up the information (and it was never any more than that) which suggested 
 
that  the  five  original  suspects  were  responsible.    During  the  course  of  this

investigation covert surveillance was carried out at the flat then occupied by Dobson. 
Video  and  audio  footage  demonstrated  that  apart  from  Jamie  Acourt,  who  was  on 
remand in custody throughout this period of surveillance, the remaining four suspects 
 
were present together on a number of occasions at the flat then occupied by Dobson. 
 
All  four  may  have  known  that  they  were  subject  to  surveillance,  but  they  were 
recorded  from  time  to  time  making  racist  comments,  brandishing  knives,  and 
apparently  going  out  into  the  street  carrying  knives.    Some  language  used  in  these 
conversations  was  alarmingly  and  aggressively  racist,  and  some  extremely  violent 
 
gestures  were  also  recorded.  Although  different  things  were  said  by  different 
 
members of the group, it seems apparent that all were party to this kind of language 
and behaviour.  On the other hand nothing said by any one of them, as recorded on the 
audio and video probes, involved an express or implied admission of involvement or 
participation in the attack on Stephen Lawrence.  In any event, before the enactment 
of the 2003 Act, this material would probably not have been admissible in evidence: 
nowadays there is a respectable argument that it should be admitted.  That would be a 
decision for the trial judge in the light of the issues arising in any trial.   

At  the  conclusion  of  the  second  investigation,  the  view  of  the  Crown  Prosecution 
Service  was  that  no  sufficient  admissible  evidence  was  available  to  justify 
prosecution.  This was a balanced objective assessment of the forensic realities: the 
prospects of a successful prosecution were negligible. 

Accordingly, perhaps in despair at the inadequacies of the investigative process and 
the fact that no one had been brought to justice for the murder of their son, members 
of  the  Lawrence  family  decided  to  start  a  private  prosecution.    In  April  1995  Neil 
Acourt, Knight and Norris were arrested, Jamie Acourt was arrested two days later 
and Dobson was eventually arrested in late August. 

Just before Dobson’s arrest committal proceedings against Neil Acourt, Jamie Acourt, 
Knight and Norris began.  At the end of the committal the prosecution did not seek 
the  committal  of  Jamie  Acourt  for  trial,  and  the  committing  Magistrate  discharged 
Norris.  Neil  Acourt  and  Knight  were  committed  for  trial  at  the  Central  Criminal 
Court  on  11th  September  1995.    Following  separate  committal  proceedings  against 
 
Dobson, in December 1995, he too was committed for trial. 

 

The trial of Neil Acourt, Knight and Dobson began on 16 April 1996.  The evidence 
of Brooks was crucial to the success of the prosecution, but as we have indicated, it 
was flawed.  The question whether his evidence should be placed before the jury was 
examined in detail at a voir dire.  Brooks gave evidence on three days.  After hearing 
argument,  Curtis  J  concluded  that  his  evidence  of  identification  of  any  of  those 
 
involved  in  the  attack  on  Stephen  Lawrence  was  inadmissible.    The  judgment  was 
impeccable, the reasoning clear, and the conclusion unavoidable.   

In very brief summary, there was no true recognition of any assailants at the time of 
the  offence,  and  although  the  judge  was  sympathetic  to  Brooks,  who  when  all  was 
said  and  done  had  been  an  intended  victim  of  the  attackers,  he  had  over  the 
investigations  identified  three  or  four  different  individuals  as  the  main  person  who 
 
attacked Stephen Lawrence.  In reality he did not know whether he was “on his head 
or his heels”.  The identifications made by Brooks were open to serious question on 
the  ground  that  there  was  no  true  recognition  at  the  time  when  the  purported 
 
identifications took place, and that the identifications thereafter were tainted by the

knowledge  and  information  gleaned  in  gossip  and  discussion  in  the  locality  in  the 
weeks after the murder.  To admit this evidence of identification would amount to an 
injustice,  and  the  injustice  suffered  by  the  Lawrence  family  could  not  be  cured  by 
 
adding another to the one they were already suffering.  The entire judgment of Curtis 
J is attached to this judgment as Appendix A. 

   

On  25th  April  1996,  the  prosecution  having  considered  its  position,  indicated  that 
 
without the identification evidence made by Brooks the remaining evidence did not 
provide a sufficiently reliable basis to enable the jury to infer the guilt of any of the 
three  defendants.  That  conclusion,  too,  was  inevitable.    No  further  evidence  was 
offered against them.  On Curtis J’s direction, the jury entered “not guilty” verdicts. 
The verdict in relation to Dobson is the subject of the present application. 

 

The statutory criteria 

Until  Part  10  of  the  Criminal  Justice  Act  2003  (the  2003  Act)  came  into  force  the 
ancient  rule  against  double  jeopardy  represented  an  insuperable  barrier  to  a  second 
prosecution  of  any  of  those  acquitted  at  the  Central  Criminal  Court  in  April  1996. 
 
The rule has been subject to limited statutory abrogation in relation to a number of 
qualifying offences, of which murder is one.

Section 78 of the 2003 Act provides: 

“(1)  The requirements of this section are met if there is new 
and compelling evidence against the acquitted person… 

(2)  Evidence is new if it was not adduced in the proceedings in 

 

which the person was acquitted… 

(3)  Evidence is compelling if – 

 

 
(a)	 

 
(b)	 

 
(c)	 

it is reliable, 
 

it is substantial, and 

in the context of the outstanding issues, it appears highly 
probative of the case against the acquitted person. 

(4)  The  outstanding  issues  are  the  issues  in  dispute  in  the  proceedings  in 

   
which the person was acquitted…” 

Thus “compelling evidence” for the purposes of section 78 is defined in the section 
itself.  It does not mean that the evidence must be irresistible, or that absolute proof of 
guilt is required.  In other words, the court should not and is certainly not required to 
 
usurp the function of the jury, or, if a new trial is ordered, to indicate to the jury what 
the verdict should be.  Our attention has been drawn to the observations of the Vice 
 
President, Lord Justice Hughes, in R v (G), B (S) [2009] EWCA Crim 1207 where the 
proposed new evidence, of a co-accused who had been convicted at the original trial, 
did not satisfy the test of reliability.  At para 5 of the abbreviated judgment, the Vice 
President observed that it is “only where there is compelling new evidence of guilt, of 
 
the kind which cannot realistically be disputed, that the exceptional step of quashing 
an acquittal will be justified”.  The purpose of this observation, as para 9 makes clear,

was to highlight that the quashing of an acquittal is an exceptional step, which indeed 
it is, and can only be ordered if the statutory requirement in relation to the “reliability” 
of the new evidence is clearly established.   

However  the  legislative  structure  does  not  suggest  that  availability  of  a  realistic 
 
defence argument which may serve to undermine the reliability or probative value of 
the new evidence must, of itself, preclude an order quashing the acquittal.  It must, of 
 
course, be carefully analysed, and given its proper weight.  If the argument, or indeed 
any defence evidence, leads the court to conclude that the new evidence is not, after 
all, as reliable or substantial as it was thought to be, or that it no longer appears to be 
highly probative of guilt, then the court cannot be satisfied that the statutory test has 
been  met.    That  is  a  fact  specific  decision.    In  the  end,  there  are  three  defined 
elements: provided the new evidence is reliable, substantial, and appears to be highly 
probative, for the purposes of section 78 it is compelling: otherwise it is not.   

 
22.	 

Section 79 of the 2003 Act addresses the separate question which arises once the court 
is satisfied that new and compelling evidence as defined by section 78 is available. It 
 
provides: 

“(1)  The  requirements  of  this  section  are  met  if  in  all  the 
 
circumstances  it  is  in  the  interests  of  justice  for  the  court  to 
make the order… 

(2)	  That  question  is  to  be  determined  having  regard  in 

 

particular to – 

 
(a)	 

 
(b)	 

 
(c)	 

 
(d)	 

whether existing circumstance make a fair trial unlikely; 

for  the  purposes  of  that  question  and  otherwise,  the 
length of time since the qualifying offence was allegedly 
committed; 

whether  it  is  likely  that  the  new  evidence  would  have 
been  adduced  in  the  earlier  proceedings  against  the 
acquitted person but for a failure by an officer or by a 
prosecutor to act with due diligence or expedition. 

whether,  since  those  proceedings  or,  if  later,  since  the 
commencement  of  this  Part,  any  officer  or  prosecutor 
has failed to act with due diligence or expedition. 

(3)	  … 

 

 

(4)	  Where the earlier prosecution was conducted by a person other than a 
prosecutor, sub-section (2)(c) applies in relation to that person as well as 
in relation to a prosecutor.” 

The interests of justice test requires attention to be focussed on the express statutory 
criteria  provided  in  section  79,  but  these  criteria,  although  wide  ranging,  are  not 
exhaustive.  They  are  partly  directed  to  events  during  the  original  investigative  and 
 
trial process, a requirement designed to avoid delay in the administration of justice as 
 
well as inefficiency and lack of direction which might result from a perception that

what we shall describe as a second bite of the cherry may eventually become available 
to the prosecution.  Thus if the new evidence relied on by the prosecution would have 
 
been  revealed  for  use  at  the  first  trial  by  a  competent  investigative  and/or 
 
prosecutorial process, then the interests of justice may, on this ground alone, lead to 
the application being refused.  The interests of justice have also to be addressed in the 
context of the date when any new trial may take place, with particular emphasis on 
any failure of due diligence or expedition since the original trial and on the impact of 
any  delay  (whether  culpable  or  not)  on  the  fairness  of  the  proposed  second  trial. 
 
However compelling the new evidence may be, it is elementary that any second trial 
should be a fair one.  For this purpose the court will examine all the known facts, and 
consider  any  material  drawn  to  its  attention  on  behalf  of  the  potential  defendant, 
including any potentially prejudicial publicity attracted by the case, which may make 
 
it “unlikely” that a fair trial can take place. 

If this court is satisfied that the requirements of both sections 78 and 79 are met, the 
order must be made: otherwise the application must be dismissed (see s77).  In the 
 
context of the present application it should perhaps be highlighted that the legislative 
 
provisions  which  abrogated  the  double  jeopardy  principle  make  no  distinction 
between an acquittal following a prosecution by the Crown in the usual way, or an 
acquittal  following  a  private  prosecution.  This  approach  to  the  legislation  is 
reinforced  by  the  continuing  power  of  the  Director  of  Public  Prosecutions  under 
section 6(2) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 to take over the conduct of a 
 
prosecution  begun  by  a  private  individual,  and  thereafter  to  serve  notice  of 
discontinuance, or alternatively, to ensure its more efficient conduct.  Accordingly in 
the  present  application  we  cannot  apply  any  less  stringent  test  to  the  legislative 
requirements  merely  because  there  was  no  realistic  prospect  that  the  private 
 
prosecution would succeed. 

The issue under section 78 in this application 

The present application depends on the reliability of new scientific evidence which by 
reference to the grey bomber jacket (LH/5) and the multi-coloured cardigan (ASR/2) 
closely links Dobson with the fatal attack on Stephen Lawrence.  It does not and could 
 
not  demonstrate  that  Dobson  wielded  the  knife  which  caused  the  fatal  wound,  but 
 
given the circumstances of the attack on Stephen Lawrence, that is, a group of youths 
 
in a violent enterprise converging on a young man, and attacking him as a group, it 
would  be  open  to  a  jury  to  conclude  that  any  one  of  those  who  participated  in  the 
 
attack was party to the killing and guilty of murder, or alternatively manslaughter (a 
verdict which would, if there had been sufficient evidence, also have been available at 
the first trial).  If reliable, the new scientific evidence would place Dobson in very 
close proximity indeed to Stephen Lawrence at the moment of and in the immediate 
 
aftermath of the attack, proximity, moreover, for which no innocent explanation can 
be discerned. 

On behalf of Dobson, Mr Timothy Roberts QC, in a meticulously careful submission 
submits that this evidence is unreliable and of no sufficient probative value, simply 
because the results of the new examination of Dobson’s clothing are likely to be the 
product of contamination over the years, that is, by contact with Stephen Lawrence’s 
 
blood  and  his  clothing.  On  this  basis,  even  if  the  scientific  evidence  is  reliable  in 
itself,  the  apparent  links  with  Stephen  Lawrence  are  unconnected  with  Dobson’s 
presence  and  involvement  at  the  scene,  but  rather  are  the  result  of  outdated  or

incompetent storage or packaging or transporting arrangements, and therefore they are 
not probative at all, and certainly not highly probative. 

 

Evidence relating to clothing at the first trial 

 
27.	 

At the time of the fatal attack, Stephen Lawrence was wearing the following layers of 
 
clothing on his upper body: 

 
(a) 

 
(b) 

 
(c)	 

 
(d)	 

 
(e)	 

A “Raiders” jacket (SP/3) 
 

A body warmer (SP/4); 

A blue cardigan (SP/2); 

A red polo short (SP/5); and 

A vest (SP6) 

After his arrival at hospital, his bloodstained upper clothing was cut from him, the cut 
being made through all the layers of clothing simultaneously, along the full length of 
one arm and across the body, and passing over  the site of one of the bleeding stab 
wounds.  These  clothes  were  bundled  together  and  placed  in  a  plastic  hospital  sack 
(SP/1).  His lower garments were also removed, and placed in another hospital sack 
(SP/7).  In due course they were seized as part of the investigative process.   

As we have explained, a number of items of clothing were also seized from the home 
 
of Dobson during the course of the search at the time of his first arrest on 7th May 
1993.  These were the grey bomber-type jacket with black cuffs and waistline, and 
bright yellow trim to the pockets and collar, found in a bedroom occupied by Dobson 
at  his  home  address  (LH/5)  and  an  extra  large  multi-coloured  “St  Michael”  wool 
cardigan  with  horizontal  patterns  found  within  a  wardrobe  in  his  parents’  bedroom 
(ASR/2). 

In the early stages of the investigation, scientific testing was carried out initially by 
the  Metropolitan  Police  Forensic  Science  Laboratory  and  then  by  the  Forensic 
Science Service.  For present purposes nothing turns on the distinction between the 
two, and for convenience we shall therefore refer to the “FSS” throughout. When the 
clothing  of  Stephen  Lawrence  and  the  suspects  was  scientifically  examined  for  the 
first time by FSS, the view was taken that it was not a worthwhile exercise to search 
the  clothing  of  the  suspects  for  fibre  transfer  from  Stephen  Lawrence’s  clothing. 
Principally  that  was  because  of  the  delay  of  two  weeks  between  the  time  of  the 
 
stabbing and the arrests and seizing of clothing from the suspects.  A further reason 
was that in any event any contact between Stephen Lawrence and his attackers could 
only have been brief.  There was therefore thought to be only a very slim chance that 
any fibres from his clothing would be found on the clothing of the suspects even if 
they were involved in the attack.  However a search was made for fibres which might 
have transferred the other way, that is from the clothing of the suspect to his clothing. 
This process produced only limited results, which can be summarised as follows. 

 

 

Textile  fibres  were  removed  from  the  inside  of  the  plastic  bag  into  which  Stephen 
Lawrence’s  right  hand  was  placed  (RC/4).    They  included  two  purple/brown  wool 
fibres which were found to have the same microscopic, colour and dye characteristics 

 

 
28.

as constituent fibres found on the multicoloured cardigan (ASR/2) recovered from the 
bedroom of Dobson’s parents.  At the time this was thought to provide no more than 
“weak support” for the assertion that the two fibres had originated from that cardigan. 
In  addition  to  the  two  brown  fibres,  a  single  white  polyester  fibre  with  the  same 
 
microscopic characteristics as constituent fibres from the jacket (LH/5) seized from 
Dobson’s bedroom was found in the right hand bag (RC/2).  In addition a single grey 
cotton  fibre  with  the  same  microscopic  and  dye  characteristics  as  the  constituent 
fibres  of  the  jacket  (LH/5)  was  recovered  from  within  the  plastic  sack  (SP/7)  into 
which  Stephen  Lawrence’s  lower  clothing  had  been  placed  at  the  hospital.  The 
opinion expressed at the time was that this provided only “very weak” support for the 
assertion that the white polyester fibre and the grey cotton fibre may have originated 
from the jacket (LH/5).

36.	 

The jacket (LH/5) was visually examined for blood, and the then usual KM screening 
test was carried out.  The presence of blood was not detected. 

In August 1995 an independent forensic scientist, Dr Gallop, was instructed by the 
solicitors  conducting  the  private  prosecution.    She  took  the  view  that  it  was 
appropriate  to  look  for  any  fibre  transfer  from  Stephen  Lawrence’s  trousers  to  the 
trousers of the suspects, since the deceased’s trousers were made of a material which 
could  be  expected  to  shed  fibres,  and  the  nature  of  the  attack  could  have  involved 
direct  contact  between  the  lower  limbs  of  the  attackers  and  the  victim.    That 
examination was carried out, but revealed nothing of significance. 

Thus at the time of the unsuccessful prosecution in April 1996, there was no evidence 
of any transfer of blood from Stephen Lawrence to any suspect, and no evidence of 
any  fibre  transfer  other  than  the  four  fibres,  of  common  types,  to  which  we  have 
already referred.   Therefore the scientific evidence at the date of the trial, on its own, 
failed to produce any link sufficient to place Dobson, or either item of clothing found 
in his home, at the scene of the fatal attack on Stephen Lawrence.  As there was not 
 
even a purported identification of him by any witness, there was no case for him to 
answer. 

 

The investigative process 

The investigative process which has culminated in the fresh scientific evidence is long 
 
and convoluted.  We shall provide a brief narrative account of these events, but first 
 
we must make some general observations.        

Dealing  with  it  generally,  the  process  of  investigating  this  murder  was  marred  by 
 
incompetence.    The  criticisms  are  manifold.    When  the  Kent  Constabulary 
investigated  the  complaint  by  Stephen  Lawrence’s  family  against  the  Metropolitan 
Police  on  behalf  of  the  Police  Complaints  Authority, 
the  report  which  became 
 
available in December 1997, concluded that “there were a large number of oversights 
and  omissions  which  resulted  in  the  murder  investigation  failing  to  operate  to  an 
acceptable standard.” 
   

 

 
37.	 

The  Stephen  Lawrence  Inquiry  chaired  by  Sir  William  Macpherson  published  its 
 
report in February 1999, and again identified considerable deficiencies in the initial 
investigation into the murder.

40.	 

 
41.	 

The  Inquiry  stated  in  unequivocal  terms  that  the  first  police  investigation  was 
“palpably  flawed  and  deserves  severe  criticism”  and  went  on  to  observe  that  the 
second  police  investigation  “could  not  salvage  the  faults  of  the  first”  investigation. 
Some  of  the  criticism  was  directed  at  the  police  failure  to  deal  with  Brooks  in  a 
 
sufficiently sensitive and unsceptical way. Ample evidence sent to the police in the 
early stages of the investigation suggested that the “Acourt gang” was responsible for 
the  attack,  and  that  this  notorious  group  was  known  for  carrying  knives  and 
threatening  behaviour,  but  there  was  insufficient  police  action  to  ascertain  whether 
supportive information might be obtained from other sources.   

 

There is no advantage in detailing all the many criticisms made of the investigative 
process by the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry, nor indeed to repeat the criticisms made by 
others.  We  must,  however,  note  a  police  report  in  March  2001  which  was  very 
critical  of  the  handling  of  the  exhibits  in  the  case,  and  suggested  that  the  record-
keeping in relation to the movement of exhibits and their storage made it impossible 
to  vouch  for  the  integrity  of  each  exhibit.   Perhaps  all  the  ingredients  of  the  sorry 
story are encapsulated in the fact that as recently as 2008, a very experienced police 
officer with a most important role in examining the storage and continuity of exhibits, 
with  a  view  to  rebutting  criticisms  based  on  potential  contamination,  was  removed 
from his post.  In response to that removal, he apparently sabotaged the integrity of 
 
the continuity chart that he was preparing.  In short, therefore, from start virtually to 
finish, the investigation was bedevilled with difficulty.         

 

There are two questions for us arising from the unhappy history of the investigations 
into  the  death  of  Stephen  Lawrence.  The  first  is  whether  these  difficulties  in  the 
  
investigative process, both at the time, and since, as the case has been examined and 
re-examined, should lead us to doubt the reliability of the findings now made by the 
forensic  scientists’  re-examination  of  the  jacket  (LH/5)  and  the  cardigan  (ASR/2). 
The  second  is  to  address  the  possible  impact  of  the  history  of  incompetence  in  the 
context  of  the  “interests  of  justice  question”  which  falls  to  be  considered  under 
section 79 (2)(c), that is, whether the absence of this new evidence from the first trial 
resulted from investigative failings. 

 

It is perhaps worth underlining that the Macpherson Inquiry directed no criticism at 
 
the forensic scientists, but rather criticised a number of aspects of the investigation 
which, as the scientists made clear, made their task more difficult. In the meantime 
although a number of different investigations of possible new lines were identified, 
and  the  murder  has  been  under  continuous  review  until  today,  the  results  of  these 
 
investigations have not produced any new reliable and admissible evidence on which 
to  base  the  present  application,  beyond  the  new  scientific  evidence  which  we  have 
 
been asked to consider. We must now address that evidence, and then having done so, 
assess it in the light of the submission that the evidence is unreliable as an indication 
that Dobson was involved in the attack. 

 

42.	  Within  that  general  context  we  shall  briefly  summarise  the  history  of  the  scientific 
investigations. This is largely taken from the Crown’s analysis of the relevant dates 
 
and history.  These were not challenged at the hearing before us. 

 

The  first  exhibits  submitted  by  the  police  were  received  by  the  FSS  on  28th  April, 
1993,  that  is  before  any  of  the  original  suspects  were  arrested.    They  were 
accompanied by a narrative account of the attack, and the initial emphasis was on the 

 
43.
--------

items  recovered  from  around  the  scene  of  the  attack  as  potential  weapons  to  be 
examined for blood.  At that stage in the investigation it was thought that the victim 
had been struck with a “metal bar or piece of wood”.   

Thereafter the results of the searches from the homes of the original suspects were 
submitted on 15th May 1993.  At the time it was routine for fibre comparisons to be 
undertaken, but on 15th June, Mr Wain of the FSS indicated that it was “unlikely” that 
 
fibres  would  be  found  on  the  suspects  clothes  as  they  were  not  arrested,  and  the 
clothing was not seized until two weeks or more after the offence.   In any event in 
 
view  of  the  history  of  the  attack,  and  the  items  of  clothing  themselves,  he  was 
extremely guarded about the possibility of establishing any links between the victim 
and the suspects.  The fibre examination would therefore concentrate on the clothes of 
 
the victim to see whether there were any matching fibres from the suspects.  In July 
1993 the FSS confirmed the view that searching for fibres from the deceased’s clothes 
on the clothes of the suspects would not be “worthwhile”.    

 

In August 1993, the jacket (LH/5) and the cardigan (ASR/2) were first submitted for 
 
examination.  On 28th October, they were examined by Mr Wain’s assistant, Yvonne 
Turner, whose work that day also included the examination of a set of exhibits from 
an  entirely  unconnected  robbery  investigation  (reference  number  SW/2746/93).  At 
that  time  she  recorded  that  no  tapings  were  made  in  relation  to  LH/5  and  ASR/2 
when, as we shall see, the Crown relies on taping examinations of these clothes made 
 
at the time. We shall return to this clear discrepancy at a later stage, and consider in 
more detail the evidence to the tapings in question: AW/47 in relation to LH/5, and 
AW/44 in relation to ASR/2. 

In brief summary, however, the work carried out by the FSS at this stage was to look 
for  any  fibres  from  the  suspects’  clothes  on  the  deceased’s  clothes  and  for  any 
evidence  of  blood  on  items  recovered  from  the  scene,  in  particular  any  potential 
weapons,  and  on  the  clothing  recovered  from  the  suspects.  The  search  for  blood 
involved, in accordance with standard practice at the time, screening with chemicals 
and  a  visual  examination,  with  the  naked  eye,  but  only  involved  the  use  of  a  low 
power microscope in relation to specific areas such as seams.  No blood was found on 
any of the potential weapons, and such blood as was found on the clothing could not 
have  come  from  Stephen  Lawrence.    The  outer  clothing  of  Stephen  Lawrence  was 
examined for fibres which may have come from the suspects, but, as we have seen, 
 
the  exploration/assessment  of  possible  transfer  of  fibres  from  Stephen  Lawrence’s 
clothing to the suspects was not believed to be a worthwhile exercise because of the 
lapse of time between the attack and the seizure of the items of clothing. This was in 
accordance with accepted research at the time. 

Over  the  years  greater  experience  and  increased  knowledge  and  expertise  have 
produced incremental improvements in the way in which questions of this kind are 
 
examined  and  scientists  have  reconsidered  the  way  in  which  they  should  be 
In  2006,  a  re-investigation  of  a  number  of  historic  or  “cold”  cases,

including this one, began.  The new strategy began with an examination, by a new 
team of scientists from LGC, of the FSS tapings made of Stephen Lawrence’s outer 
clothing for evidence of any paint which could have been transferred from a scaffold 
pole recovered from near the scene.  This examination exposed a series of connected 
findings  which  culminated  in  the  discovery  of  the  new  evidence.    Dealing  with  it 
shortly, during the examination of the FSS taping (AW/2) from Stephen Lawrence’s

jacket (SP/3) a significant number of red fibres were observed.  One possible source 
of  these  red  fibres  was  the  red  polo  shirt  (SP/5)  worn  by  Stephen  Lawrence 
underneath  his  jacket  and  his  cardigan.  Similar  red  fibres  were  also  found  on  a 
 
taping (AW/5) taken from his green corduroy trousers.  Before these discoveries the 
red polo shirt (SP/5) had not been considered as a possible source of fibre transfer, 
just because it was worn beneath Stephen Lawrence’s outer clothing.   However the 
discovery  of  the  red  fibres  led  to  an  examination  of  AW/47,  the  FSS  taping  of  the 
jacket  (LH/5),  which  revealed  seven  pink/orange  fibres  and  four  red/orange  fibres 
which also matched fibres in the red polo shirt (SP/5).  From these a search was made 
for any other fibres from Stephen Lawrence’s clothing on the FSS tapings of other 
items  of  the  clothing  of  the  original  suspects,  and  two  green/blue  acrylic  fibres  on 
AW/47,  and  three  more  on  AW/44,  the  tapings  from  ASR/2  were  found,  which 
matched  the  fibres  in  Stephen  Lawrence’s  clothing.    As  the  testing  proceeded,  one 
particular  test  using  an  instrument  which  provides  an  objective  assessment  of  the 
colour returned a result from a component normally associated with the presence of 
blood on one of the pink/orange fibres found on AW/47, the tapings from the jacket 
(LH/5)  which  matched  the  fibres  in  the  red  polo  shirt  (SP/5).    This  led  the 
investigation  to  reflect  on  the  possibility  that  there  might  be  blood  on  the  jacket 
(LH/5) notwithstanding the negative results for blood when the item was examined on 
earlier occasions, and indeed when it was first screened for blood in the initial stages 
of the new investigation. 
 

In earlier days it had not been standard practice in relation to the examination of blood 
and fibres to examine debris which may have fallen off any exhibits within the bag in 
 
which the exhibit was sealed.  The debris which had been collected by LGC from the 
original exhibit bag containing the jacket (LH/5) was also now examined, and this led 
to the discovery of tiny flakes of blood in the debris.  One of the blood flakes had two 
blue  acrylic  fibres  embedded  in  it.  These  fibres  matched  fibres  in  Stephen 
Lawrence’s  cardigan  (SP/2).    Testing  of  the  flake  containing  the  fibres  and  other 
blood flakes from the same debris in the original exhibit bag produced DNA profiles 
matching Stephen Lawrence.  Thereafter attention switched back to the jacket (LH/5) 
 
itself.  As the earlier examinations using techniques which were still standard up to 
2006 had not produced any positive results, it was decided that the garment should be 
subjected to a comprehensive wholesale microscopic search.  It was this examination 
which revealed a tiny blood stain on the back of the collar that had absorbed into the 
weave  of  the  fabric,  from  which  an  almost  full  DNA  profile  matching  Stephen 
 
Lawrence  was  obtained.  The  more  extensive  examination  also  revealed  further 
adhering tiny blood flakes in other places on the jacket.  A partial DNA profile, again 
 
matching Stephen Lawrence was obtained.   

Thereafter  the  FSS  taping  made  in  autumn  1993  of  the  jacket  (LH/5)  was  re-
examined.  More tiny blood flakes were then discovered, although when DNA testing 
was carried out, the result was inconclusive.   

In  summary,  the  revelation  of  the  material  which  is  now  relied  on  by  the  Crown 
resulted from careful re-examination of available material using different techniques, 
and following up each new result as and when it became available to see whether new 
techniques might produce yet further fresh evidence.  We shall summarise the results.

The grey jacket (LH/5) 

 

(a)  A tiny blood stain was found on the exposed part of the collar when the collar is 
folded down.  The stain is very small indeed, with a visible area of 0.5mm x 0.25mm. 
 
It was partly soaked into the white yarn of the fabric with some thicker parts on the 
surface, and heavy in the centre.  It had a different overall appearance to the flakes 
adhering to the grey polyester outside surface.  An almost full DNA profile matching 
Stephen Lawrence was obtained. (1:billion). 

(b) 43 blood flakes were also found, mostly on the grey fabric on the outside of the 
jacket, but also on a part of the inner padded lining of the jacket, which was exposed 
when  part  of  the  outer  material  was  cut  away  in  the  course  of  the  scientific 
examination in the 1990s.  These flakes adhered to the jacket as discrete flakes, and 
were not absorbed into the weave.  Some of the fragments have been tested and have 
been  identified  as  blood,  and  the  others  which  have  not  been  tested  appear  to  be 
 
blood.  By  aggregating  a  number  of  fragments  it  has  been  possible  to  obtain  an 
incomplete DNA profile matching the DNA profile of the deceased (1:500). 

Tapings from LH5 made during the course of the original investigation (AW/47) 

(a)  Flakes or fragments were found on the tapings taken from the outer surface of 
LH/5 which gave a positive reaction for blood when tested, but without providing any 
conclusive DNA profiling. 

(b)  Four rare red-orange polyester fibres and seven quite common pink-orange cotton 
fibres, all of which were microscopically indistinguishable from the fibres in Stephen 
Lawrence’s polo shirt (SP/5) were found on the tapings.  

(c)  One  of  the  pink-orange  fibres  gave  a  spectrum  result  which  corresponded  to  a 
bloodied fibre from SP/5, and was more likely to have produced that result due to the 
presence of blood than because of colour variation. 

(d) 
Two  quite  rare  green-blue  acrylic  fibres  which  were  microscopically 
indistinguishable from the fibres in the cuffs/waistband of Stephen Lawrence’s jacket 
 
SP/3 were found. 

(e) Five grey cotton fibres of no probative significance were also found. 

Debris from the original packaging of LH/5, collected by LGC during the recent 
investigation. 

(a)  A  taping  of  debris  from  the  inside  of  the  original  bag  of  LH/5  revealed  an  
 
apparently neat blood fragment encasing two blue acrylic fibres.  The blood fragment 
 
was found to have an almost full DNA profile matching Stephen Lawrence (1:billion).  
One fibre was a quite rare long blue acrylic fibre which entered and exited the blood 
fragment.    The  other  was  a  shorter  blue  acrylic  fibre,  also  quite  rare,  which  was 
encased  within  the  blood  fragment  and  only  discovered  when  the  fragment  was 
 
broken open.  These fibres must have come into contact with the blood when it was 
 
wet.  Both  these  fibres  are  similar  to  each  other,  and  could  have  come  from  SP/2, 
Stephen Lawrence’s blue cardigan.

(b) Fragments of blood were found within the debris. Three of these were combined 
and found to have a full DNA profile matching Stephen Lawrence (1:billion). 

(c)  One  red-orange  polyester  fibre  of  a  rare  type  which  is  microscopically 
indistinguishable from the fibres in the deceased’s polo shirt (SP/5) was found inside 
 
an exhibit bag which had been used to repackage LH/5.

Three common blue wool fibres which could have come from ASR/2 were found of 
this taping.  However the significance of these fibres is debatable because ASR/2 is 
made up of so many colours and shades of wool that there must be a greatly increased 
 
chance of finding matching wool fibres on an item selected at random compared to 
finding a wool fibre from an item which contains only one shade of wool.

51.	 

Expert  evidence  produced  by  the  prosecution  summarises  the  significance  of  these 
 
new  findings  in  relation  to  the  jacket  (LH/5).    The  findings  in  relation  to  fibres 
provide: 

“Extremely strong scientific support for the assertions that the 
 
evidential fibres found within the material recovered from the 
grey  jacket  (LH/5)  originated  from  the  clothing  of  Stephen 
Lawrence,  rather  than  being  due  to  chance  matches…the 
numbers of matching fibres present on the jacket are …higher 
than one might expect if they were from secondary transfer and 
far  more  so  than  if  they  were  due  to  a  tertiary  transfer…the 
 
presence  of  the  fibres  provides  at  least  moderately  strong 
scientific support for the assertion that they arrived as a result 
of  primary  contact  with  the  clothing  of  Stephen  Lawrence 
rather than having arrived by an indirect route.” 

 
52.	 

Addressing the new findings in relation to blood and fibres together: 

“The simplest explanation is that the wearer of the jacket was 
involved in the attack and the blood and fibres that were found

were what remained of the evidential material transferred…it is 
extremely  unlikely  that  blood  just  happened  to  fall  upon  or 
come into contact with fibres already transferred to the jacket, 
and  far  more  likely  that  the  blood  stained  fibres  found  were 
transferred  to  the  jacket  in  an  already  bloodied  state.    If 
collectively  or  individually  they  did  not  arise  from  primary 
transfer, the blood, the blood-stained fibres and the un-bloodied 
fibres (in the number and range of types found) would all have 
 
had  to  have  been  deposited  by  some  indirect  route  or  routes, 
involving  contact  with  the  jacket  when  some  of  the  blood  at 
least  was  still  wet…when  considered  in  combination,  the 
 
explanation that blood, bloodstained matching fibres and non-
bloodstained  fibres  deposit  by  secondary  transfer  is,  in  my 
opinion, an unlikely explanation for the evidence that has been 
found.  The evidence is even less likely to have been found if it 
 
is proposed that the fibres were acquired by the jacket during a 
secondary transfer event and the blood and bloodstained fibres 
by  a  separate  transfer  event…the  combination  of  blood/DNA 
and  fibres  provides  extremely  persuasive  evidence  to  link  the 
wearer of the grey jacket (LH/5) to the attack itself and/or to 
contact with the perpetrators soon afterwards.” 

The  possible  conclusions  in  relation  to  ASR/2  are  more  limited.    In  particular, 
although the finding in relation to the three green-blue acrylic fibres provides strong 
scientific  support  for  the  proposition  that  the  fibres  originated  from  SP/3,  and 
moderate scientific support for the assertion that they were transferred as a result of 
primary contact between the two items of clothing, the findings in relation to the three 
 
blue wool fibres and the one turquoise fibre lack significance because ASR/2 contains 
so many colours and shades of wool. 

These new findings, relating to garments which can be linked to Dobson are crucial to 
the present application.  The question is whether they have revealed items of blood 
flakes and blood stains and fibres which demonstrate that Dobson was in very close 
 
proximity to Stephen Lawrence at or in the immediate aftermath of the fatal attack, or 
whether  some  reasonable  alternative  explanation  for  them,  either  as  a  result  of 
contamination, or the absence of sufficient security against the risk of contamination, 
or the consequence of the process of the original examinations and tests themselves 
may be available.  It is virtually self-evident that this is substantial highly probative 
evidence of the involvement of Dobson in the killing of Stephen Lawrence, provided, 
and it is a very important proviso, it is established that it is reliable, not so much in the 
sense  that  the  integrity  or  competence  of  the  current  scientific  conclusions  may  be 
open  to  question,  (which  has  not  been  contended  before  us)  but,  much  more 
important, that the findings may be explicable on some reasonable alternative basis, 
such  as  possible  contamination,  even  if  entirely  inadvertent  and  accidental.    In 
essence, this is the core of the submissions by Mr Roberts, and he relies on the fact 
that  none  of  the  material  now  relied  on  was  found  during  the  course  of  the  long 
history  of  investigations  and  examinations  of  the  jacket  (LH/5)  and  the  cardigan 
 
(ASR/2) over the years. 

 
53.

--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 
 
 

 

 
55.	 

His  submission  is  illustrated  by  reference  to  a  specific  feature  of  the  case,  that  Dr 
Gallop, when she conducted her investigation for the purposes of the first trial, had 
said  that  the  polo  shirt  (SP/5)  was  not  a  suitable  source  for  the  transfer  of  fibres 
because it was an undergarment, and that the jacket (SP/3) was not made of material 
which would be expected to retain fibres.  Now, Mr Roberts pointed out, the Crown 
asserts  that  the  polo  shirt  (SP/5)  shed  fibres  on  to  the  deceased’s  outer  garment  to 
 
such an extent, and his jacket (SP/3) retained those fibres to such good effect, that no 
fewer  than  eleven  fibres  from  SP/5  are  said  to  have  been  transferred  to  the  jacket 
(LH/5) found in Dobson’s bedroom.  That he suggests is inherently implausible.  The 
 
more realistic explanation, he submits, is to be found in the way in which the exhibits 
have  been  handled  over  the  many  years  since  the  jacket  (LH/5)  was  seized  by  the 
police. 

 

56.	  We must examine the submissions made by Mr Roberts in sufficient detail to explain 
them,  and  our  understanding  of  them,  but  we  shall  not  prolong  the  judgment  by 
reference to the many hundreds of pages of material which we have examined. 

 

57.	  Mr  Roberts  began  by  making  a  general  submission  about  the  way  in  which  the 
exhibits in this case were packaged.  He pointed out that the long-established practice 
of  packing  exhibits  in  paper  bags  sealed  with  sellotape  is  out  of  date,  and  in  the 
context of a case which has continued over many years, is inherently unreliable.  With 
the passage of time, the sellotape loses its adhesive quality and the result is that the 
seal of the bag will eventually break, either in full or in part.  When that happens all or 
 
part of the bag may gape open, and thus an opportunity for tiny particles to enter into 
it and come to rest on the exhibit within is provided.  As the exhibit bag is handled 
and moved about, the break in the seal may be caused to gape and then to close, so it 
is impossible to predict when the seal has failed, or whether it has failed: much may 
depend on the precise type of sellotape used for the purpose, and the temperature of 
the room in which the bag sealed by the sellotape is stored.  There was no system for 
periodic inspection or renewal of the sellotape seals.  There is no industry standard 
which  suggests  the  appropriate  period  for  which  sellotape  should  be  regarded  as 
 
providing a reliable seal for a paper bag.  The failure of a seal may only be identified 
 
after it has failed, by when, it will already be too late to preserve the integrity of the 
exhibit contained in the paper bag. 

 

58.	  Mr Roberts supported this submission by drawing our attention, first, to an internal 
police report prepared by Detective Chief Superintendent Webb, which referred to a 
problem  he  had  raised  with  the  forensic  scientist,  Mr  Wain,  namely  “that  of  the 
deterioration  of  the  packaging  of  the  clothing  exhibits…the  original  sellotape  seals 
used when the items were seized in 1993 had become so ineffective, that in Adrian 
 
Wain’s view, in the event of alien blood cells being found on the suspects’ clothing in 
any  subsequent  examination,  he  would  be  unable  to  rule  out  the  possibility  of 
contamination  having  occurred  at  the  point  of  storage”.    Mr  Roberts  came  to  the 
 
report of the review of the exhibits carried out by DC Sloper in 2001.  This review 
documented a number of exhibit bags which were not securely sealed.  Thus the sack 
(SP/1) was sealed and secure, but of the exhibit bags within it, those containing both 
the cardigan (SP/2) and the jacket (SP/3) of the deceased were “open at sellotape seal 
line”: so too was the exhibit bag containing the multi-coloured cardigan (ASR/2). 

 

59.  Mr  Roberts  addressed  the  prevailing  view  during  the  1990s  that  once  a  scientific 
examination had been completed, it was no longer of great importance to handle the
--------

exhibits  carefully.  Thus,  by  way  of  example,  he  suggested  that  the  handling  of 
exhibits at court paid little or no heed to the necessity to preserve the integrity of the 
exhibits for the future, and to avoid the risk of fibres or other debris being shed into 
the  exhibit  packaging,  or  even  on  to  another  exhibit.    He  pointed  to  the  particular 
feature that the unsuccessful prosecution in 1996 was conducted privately, with the 
result, he suggests that there can be no confidence that the proper procedures were 
 
followed, or at any rate no sufficient confidence that they were. 

 

60.	  Mr  Roberts  moved  to  the  evidence  that  exhibits  were  “over  bagged”.  In  short,  this 
means the placing of one or more wrapped exhibit into a larger bag or sack for ease of 
 
transport or storage, which clearly happened in this case, without any attempt to avoid 
mingling  wrapped  exhibits  from  more  than  one  source  in  the  same  sack.    It  is, 
however,  important  in  this  context  to  underline  that  each of  the  exhibits  within  the 
larger bag or sack would itself continue to be wrapped in its own individual bag.  Mr 
Roberts highlighted a number of risks, and the scientists who gave evidence before us 
 
agreed  with  him  that  they  included:  the  possibility  that  the  seal  of  an  exhibit  bag 
might fail; or without proper procedures, that even a sealed exhibit bag may bear on 
its  outer  surface  fibres  or  fragments  of  blood  which  have  fallen  from  the  exhibit 
before it was packaged and sealed. Movement of the packages within the larger bag 
may then cause such fibres or fragments to be dislodged from the outer surface of one 
 
bag and to land on another bag; if the seal of the second bag happens to have failed, 
so that it is open, fibres or fragments might enter it and come to rest on the exhibit 
within, or indeed fall into the debris, with the result that an entirely spurious finding 
 
might then arise; and finally, even if the seal of the second bag is intact there is an 
opportunity, in the event of inappropriate exhibit-handling, for the exhibit to pick up 
fibres or fragments from the outer surface of its bag. 

 

61.	  Mr Roberts went on to submit that there was clear evidence to indicate that from time 
to  time  poor  practice  was  adopted  or  inadequate  care  taken  with  the  handling  of 
exhibits.  The  particular  examples,  which  go  beyond  the  general  account  of 
incompetence to which we have already referred included:  

 
i)	 

 
ii)	 

 
iii)	 

The  Macpherson  Report  noted  that  one  exhibit  had  been  lost  altogether,  in 
circumstances which were condemned as “unforgivable”. 

In  the  later  1990s  Kent  Constabulary  investigated  a  complaint  against  the 
Metropolitan Police in relation to this case, and thereupon took possession of 
all the exhibits.  Once they were returned to the Metropolitan Police, a review 
 
found that 14 items could not be traced; 56 items were present which had not 
been recorded an at earlier stage; and the Kent Constabulary had returned over 
300 exhibits in five boxes without any form of continuity documentation. 

The Sloper Report in 2001, which set out the impossibility of  vouching “for 
the integrity of each exhibit”, although the Report went on to conclude “that in 
 
the vast majority of incidents in this case the integrity of the exhibits is sound 
and strong rebuttal of any alleged contamination can be made.  There being 
very few occasions when exhibits have been co-mingled, and where they have, 
most of the exhibit packaging has been sealed and secured.  The only doubt I 
had is what happened to the exhibits at the private prosecution”.

iv)	 

The photographs showing that two exhibits were in turn removed from their 
packaging  and  placed  onto  the  same  piece  of  carpet  in  order  to  be 
photographed,  a  demonstration  of  a  clear  opportunity  for  the  exhibit  which 
was  photographed  second  to  pick  up  fibres  or  fragments  from  the  exhibit 
which had been photographed first. 

 

 

62.	  Mr Roberts concluded this part of his submission by reminding us of the actions of 
the officer engaged in conducting a detailed review of the exhibits, who following his 
arrest for an incident of disorder while on holiday, was removed from the case, and 
deliberately altered some of the computerised records.  Mr Roberts underlined that no 
one  can  know  how  extensive  the  alterations  were,  because  only  the  officer  himself 
knows for sure. 

Turning  to  particular  matters  highlighted  by  Mr  Roberts,  particular  emphasis  was 
placed by him on the potential contamination arising from what happened at hospital. 
 
Naturally  the  concern  of  the  hospital  staff  was  to  do  everything  possible  to  save 
Stephen  Lawrence’s  life.  The  process  of  cutting  away  the  upper  clothing  from  his 
 
body would have released fibres from each of the garments, and blood (wet at that 
stage  but  later  dry)  would  have  fallen  from  any  of  those  garments  which  were 
bloodstained. Therefore the plastic sack (SP/1) into which all the upper clothing was 
placed  would  have  contained  within  it  a  potent  source  of  material  which  could  be 
 
transferred  onto  another  exhibit  if  proper  exhibit-handling  procedures  were  not 
observed. 
If  that  occurred,  it  would  be  a  matter  of  chance  which  fibres  were 
transferred: thus the recipient garment might end up bearing fibres from all or any of 
the Stephen Lawrence’s upper garments.  Mr Roberts reinforced his point by noting 
that Stephen Lawrence’s cardigan (SP/2) was so heavily bloodstained that at a much 
later  stage  it  was  used  as  a  source  of  dried  blood  flakes  for  some  recent  scientific 
investigation.  Turning from the general observations, he made a specific submission 
in relation to the important bloodstain on the jacket collar (LH/5) and the fragments of 
blood or apparent blood recently found on that jacket.  He suggests that the finding of 
 
blood fragments on the inner lining of the padding of the jacket, an area which would 
not have been exposed at the date of the fatal attack, and was exposed by later being 
cut open in the laboratory, clearly shows that the blood fragments must have come 
 
onto  the  jacket  at  a  later  date  than  the  time  of  the  fatal  attack.    The  suggested 
explanation is that the presence of these fragments is an artefact of Phadebas testing 
on the jacket itself. 
   

Dealing with it as briefly as we may, Phadebas testing is a test for the presence of 
saliva.  The test is performed by wetting the garment which is to be tested and placing 
 
on to it a sheet of paper which has been treated with a reagent.  The paper is then 
 
covered  with  a  sheet  of  glass,  on  to  which  weights  are  placed.    The  paper  is  then 
examined  at  intervals  for  the  staining  which  is  displayed  if  saliva  is  present.    This 
 
testing process was carried out in relation to the jacket (LH/5), not as part of the initial 
scientific examination of the jacket, but at a much later date.  Mr Roberts makes the 
point that no blood was found on the jacket before the Phadebas test was carried out, 
but blood was found on it afterwards. 

A  series  of  detailed  experiments  were  carried  out  to  see  how  fragments  of  blood 
behave  if  they  are  present  on  a  garment  which  has  been  made  the  subject  of  the 
 
Phadebas test.  They show that when dampened the fragments resolubilise and acquire 
a gel-like consistency which can cause them to adhere to the surface of the garment. 
 

 
63.

65.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 
 
 

 

 
66.	 

On this basis the possible explanation for the presence of the 43 fragments of blood or 
apparent blood on jacket (LH/5) is that fragments of dried blood have come on to it 
after its initial examination, having been resolubilised when the jacket was dampened 
for the purpose of the Phadebas testing, and so they adhered to the garment.  That 
 
possibility  was  accepted  by  Mr  Edward  Jarman,  an  expert  called  before  us  by  the 
Crown, and we did not understand the Crown to argue to the contrary.   

It is the next stage in the submission which is perhaps more important.  Mr Roberts 
submitted that the tiny blood stain on the collar of the jacket (LH/5) may also be an 
artefact, produced in a similar way.  Mr Jarman accepted that he could not exclude 
that proposition as a scientific possibility, because the situation was complex with a 
number  of  variables,  and  he  was  unable  to  discern  the  precise  composition  of  the 
bloodstain.  He was however able to say that the blood had soaked into the collar, and 
therefore the blood which caused the stain appeared to have been deposited when wet. 
 
In detailed experiments he had been unable to produce a similar stain: resolubilisation 
of a dried blood fragment did not in his experiments reproduce or mimic the tiny stain 
found on the collar.  Thus the experiments which did show that the fragments of blood 
or apparent blood on the jacket could be an artefact of the Phadebas testing did not 
 
produce such a result in relation to the bloodstain on the collar.  Mr Jarman therefore 
maintained the view expressed in his written statement (which stood as his evidence 
in chief for the purposes of this hearing), that the bloodstain on the collar was in a 
 
different category to the fragments of blood or apparent blood on the jacket, and while 
he accepted the scientific possibility that the collar stain, too, could be an artefact of 
the Phadebas testing, he thought it unlikely.  He expressed his conclusion in strong 
terms.    The  collar  stain  was  “far  more  likely”  to  have  the  characteristics  which  he 
observed  if  it  was  related  to  the  fatal  attack  than  if  it  was  a  consequence  of  the 
Phadebas testing. 

 

67.	  Mr  Roberts  attached  significance  to  the  fact  that  there  was  no  stain  on  the  jacket 
(LH/5) which could indicate the earlier presence of a spot of blood which had fallen 
off  and  thereby  created  the  fragments  of  blood  which  subsequently  adhered  to  the 
 
jacket.  This,  he  submitted  is  a  feature  which  is  consistent  with  the  view  that  the 
 
fragments  of  blood  recently  found  on  the  jacket  (LH/5)  are  the  result  of  cross-
contamination.  However we were told by Mr Jarman that when a spot of blood dries 
 
and falls off a garment, the scientists will not always find any visible stain or other 
trace that it has been there.  He also told us that the total amount of blood present on 
the jacket was very small.  The aggregate quantity was such that all the 43 fragments 
could have had their origin in a spot of wet blood on the collar, some of which had 
fallen  off  when  dry,  thus  producing  the  tiny  fragments  of  blood  loose  within  the 
exhibit bag as well as the small stain on the collar. 

The other specific target at which the submissions by Mr Roberts were directed was 
the tapings AW/47.  We must begin with a slightly more detailed history.  On 28th 
 
October 1993 Mrs Turner worked both on the present case, and on an unrelated case 
of armed robbery.  This was the only date on which she was engaged working on both 
these cases.  The FSS reference for the present case was M/1595/93; the reference for 
the armed robbery was SW/2746/93.  In the robbery case there was neither an exhibit 
LH/5  nor  an  exhibit  ASR/2.    Although  Mrs  Turner  examined  fibres  in  the  robbery 
case,  they  were  not  of  the  same  type  as  the  fibres  with  which  the  present  case  is 
concerned.  On that day Mrs Turner made handwritten notes of her examinations of 

 
68.

69.	 

 
70.	 

LH/5 and ASR/2.  However her handwritten notes were initially marked by her with 
the case reference SW/2746/93, plainly a clerical error, and later corrected by over-
writing  the  reference  M/1595/93.    There  is  no  evidence  before  us  about  precisely 
when this was done, but there is clear evidence, undisputed for present purposes, that 
it had been completed by July 1995 when the notes were sent to Dr Gallop prior to the 
private prosecution. 

In the body of her notes relating to the two garments, Mrs Turner recorded in each 
 
case that she had taken a fibre sample, but also wrote down in each case “no tapings 
made”.    She  later  compiled  a  “fibre  examination  sheet”  relating  to  these  and  other 
exhibits,  which  she  told  us  she  produced  by  referring  to  her  examination  notes,  so 
unsurprisingly, this sheet repeated the record in relation to both LH/5 and ASR/2, “no 
tapings made”.  All those documents were checked at the time by Mr Wain, and he 
did not notice that any error had been made. 

As we have already indicated, Mr Wain had taken the policy decision that it would 
not be worth looking for any sign of fibre transfer from the deceased’s clothes to the 
clothing  of  the  suspects,  and  he  acknowledged  in  his  evidence  before  us  that  a 
 
decision not to take any tapings from either LH/5 or ASR/2 would be consistent with 
that policy decision.  However, notwithstanding the policy, and despite having written 
the words “no tapings made” in her notes, Mrs Turner’s evidence was that she did 
take  tapings  from  both  garments.    Unfortunately,  she  repeated  her  clerical  error  by 
 
giving AW/47, tapings from LH/5, the case reference SW/2746/93.  At a much later 
stage, when Mr Wain was looking for AW/47 he found AW/47 not in the file relating 
to the present case, but rather in the file relating to the armed robbery.   

 

71.	  Mrs Turner accepted that her contemporaneous notes record an unequivocal statement 
 
which is the exact opposite of her evidence, and she accepted that it was an aberration 
for  her  have  made  the  notes  she  did  when  she  had  in  fact  taken  tapings  from  both 
garments.  Mr Wain was referred to a note he made in 2001 in which he expressed the 
conclusion that LH/5 was taped in 1995.  He told us that he could not now remember 
 
why he had expressed that conclusion which he no longer believed to be correct.  He 
felt that he had been trying to reconcile Mrs Turner’s note of “no tapings made” with 
the fact that Dr Gallop undoubtedly did examine AW/47 in 1995, so he had assumed 
at that time that the tapings had been taken then. 

 

72.	  We  do  not  underestimate  the  difficulty  for  the  Crown  in  proving  that  the  tapings 
AW/47 were taken on 28th October 1993.  What however is clear is that on that date 
clerical errors were made, and so (subsequently) were filing errors, in the sense that 
AW/47 was found not in the file relating to the present case (to which it undoubtedly 
related) but in relation to the armed robbery. The evidence of both Mrs Turner and Mr 
Wain was to the clear effect that if the tapings had been taken at some later date, that 
is later than 28th October 1993, there would have been a separate record of what she 
 
had done, and that the incorrect case reference from AW/47 is only explicable on the 
basis that she had been working on both cases at that date.  It seems to us highly likely 
that Mrs Turner did indeed take the tapings AW/47 on 28th October 1993, but in any 
event, our decision overall is not exclusively based on the current scientific findings 
in relation to AW/47. 

 

73.	  We have examined Mr Roberts’ submissions in the light of the evidence before us, 
which includes a Report on the continuity and integrity of significant exhibits dated
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 
 
 

 

March 2011 by DS Taylor.  The officer has examined every detail of the available 
evidence about these exhibits.  The result of his work has been submitted to another 
 
witness,  Mrs  Hammond,  who  has  specifically  considered  all  the  criticisms  and 
suggestions made by Mr Roberts on behalf of the respondent about how and when 
 
cross-contamination  between  exhibits  may  have  occurred.    For  this  purpose  she 
assumed the worst-case scenario in relation to matters which were not the subject of 
 
clear evidence.  Her overall conclusion was that she accepted there had been a number 
of  hypothetical  opportunities  for  cross-contamination  to  have  occurred,  but  on 
detailed examination the risk of such cross-contamination was so remote that it could 
safely be excluded.  We have considered all her written and oral evidence together 
 
with each of the factual situations to which she has referred, but it is unnecessary and 
inappropriate to recite the details in this judgment.   

 

74.	  We take one example.  It was pointed out on behalf of the respondent that when the 
 
jacket (LH/5) was returned to the police by the FSS in November 1995, it was over-
bagged with the deceased’s jacket (SP/3).  Mrs Hammond accepted the hypothetical 
possibility that blood flakes and fibres could have been present on the outside of the 
bag  containing  SP/3,  could  then  have  been  transferred  to  the  outside  of  the  bag 
containing  LH/5,  and  then  could  later  have  come  on  to  exhibit  LH/5  itself.    But, 
 
having conceded this as a hypothetical possibility, she explained that it is so unlikely 
that, in practical terms, this sequence of events is effectively impossible.  There would 
have had to be a surprising combination of events, each of which, on its own, was 
unlikely,  and  any  such  contamination  in  or  after  November  1995  would  be  a 
remarkable coincidence having regard to the findings on the tapings (AW/47).   

 

75.	  More generally, Mrs Hammond gave evidence that she can see no realistic possibility 
of contamination in relation to tapings having occurred in this case or that the new 
evidence was affected by cross-contamination.  The new evidence is mainly based on 
tapings taken in the laboratory, tapings which are secure, and so the only period which 
needs  to  be  considered  is  the  period  before  they  were  taken.    The  possibility  of 
transfer between the packages is extremely remote because if there was anything on 
the outside of the packaging it would only remain there for a limited period, and on 
every occasion the package is handled, a proportion of any such material would be 
lost,  so  reducing  yet  further  the  possibility  of  a  later  transfer.    Dealing  with  it 
generally, we accept the evidence of Mrs Hammond and her conclusions. 

   

 

76.	  We would simply add that the answers given by Dobson when he was first questioned 
about the jacket (LH/5) were not merely that he had not been wearing it at the scene 
of  the  fatal  stabbing,  but  that  no  one  had  worn  it  for  ages.    On  this  account,  the 
combination  of  improbable  coincidences  required  for  the  suggested  “accidental” 
contaminations  would  have  had  to  have  occurred  in  relation  to  a  garment  which, 
according to Dobson himself, had not even left the home of its owner for a long time. 
 
That seems a remote possibility.  

In summary, therefore, we accept the evidence of Mrs Hammond that there has been 
 
no  realistic  opportunity  for  cross-contamination  to  have  occurred  in  a  way  which 
would or could affect the new evidence, and this evidence is highly probative of the 
conclusion that the fibres and blood to which we have referred were indeed present on 
the  jacket  (LH/5)  and  the  cardigan  (ASR/2)  because  those  clothes  were  worn  by  a 
person  or  persons  who  were  in  very  close  proximity  to  the  attack  on  Stephen 
Lawrence rather than as a result of some later contaminating event or events.  We also

accept  Mr  Jarman’s  evidence  that  none  of  his  experiments  with  resolubilisation 
reproduced a stain such as that found on the collar of LH/5, and while we respect his 
view  that  there  is  a  scientific  possibility  which  cannot  be  excluded,  we  are  also 
satisfied that his evidence as a whole is highly probative of the conclusion that the 
explanation for that stain does not lie in resolubilisation.  In effect therefore we accept 
the  Crown’s  contention  that  the  new  scientific  evidence  provides  reliable  evidence 
 
that  both  the  jacket  (LH/5)  and  the  cardigan  (ASR/2)  were  being  worn  by  an 
individual or individuals who participated in the attack on Stephen Lawrence. 

Stripped  to  essentials,  it  comes  to  this.    On  the  jacket  found  in  Dobson’s  bedroom 
(LH/5)  there  were  small  blood  flakes  providing  an  incomplete  DNA  profile  with 
Stephen Lawrence, and a very small bloodstain on the collar which provided a match 
of 1: billion.  Within the package in which that jacket was contained, a blood flake 
with another DNA match of  1: billion, encasing two blue fibres linked with Stephen 
 
Lawrence’s cardigan, deposited while the blood flake was at least partially wet, were 
found, together with a fibre linked to Stephen Lawrence’s red polo shirt.  The jacket 
was placed within the package and we have not found a shred of evidence to suggest 
that any other object was placed in the package at any time.  We recognise the more 
limited  conclusions  which  may  be  drawn  in  relation  to  the  cardigan  found  in 
Dobson’s parents’ bedroom, but they are at the very lowest, consistent with the links 
between  the  jacket  and  Stephen  Lawrence.  However,  viewed  cumulatively,  even 
allowing  for  the  contentions  advanced  by  Mr  Roberts,  this  provides  formidable 
evidence. 

The  potential  significance  of  the  material  which  we  have  examined  can  be  readily 
understood.  Is  the  newly  discovered  evidence  reliable,  substantial,  and  highly 
probative of the Crown’s allegation that Dobson was a party to the attack on Stephen 
Lawrence?  The new evidence demonstrates that the answer to that question is that 
there is a high probability that he was. Assuming that a new trial is ordered, it would 
be for the jury to decide whether his guilt was established to the criminal standard of 
 
proof,  and  if  so  whether  of  murder  or  manslaughter.  For  this  purpose  it  would  no 
doubt consider all the relevant and admissible evidence, including the clear and direct 
lie apparently told by Dobson when he was first asked to account for his movements 
 
on  the  fateful  evening.  On  his  own  admission  to  the  police  when  formally 
interviewed, that was untrue, but that falsehood was of relatively minor significance 
compared to the significance of the falsehood which would have been uttered if the 
jury were satisfied that the scientific evidence demonstrated that Dobson was indeed 
one of the group of assailants who attacked Stephen Lawrence.

Publicity 

There can be no doubt that this case has attracted an unusually high level of media 
 
attention.  We  have  been  supplied  with  a  vast  volume  of  material  based  on  media 
references  to  the  murder  of  Stephen  Lawrence.    We  doubt  whether  very  many 
individuals,  other  than  those  directly  involved  in  this  case,  will  have  seen  this 
 
encyclopaedic  volume,  and  in  relation  to  newspaper  cuttings,  each  entry  will  have 
formed part of the entire newspaper and lacked the stark impact of an article standing 
on its own.  It is possible to discern a number of reasons why the case has continued 
to attract public interest.  In part it is because every decent individual in this country

(whatever  his  or  her  racial  background)  had  come  to  hope  that  racism  with  such 
desperate consequences had been eradicated from our society.  It is caused in part by 
the overwhelming wave of public sympathy for the parents of Stephen Lawrence and 
the dignified way in which they have endured the disaster that has overtaken them. 
And it is also caused in part because, for whatever reason, no one has been brought to 
justice for a killing which occurred on the streets of London.  Nothing reported by the 
media before the trial was open to criticism, and as far as we know the reporting was 
 
not  criticised  before  or  at  the  trial  before  Curtis  J  and  the  jury  at  the  Old  Bailey. 
Similarly, no real criticism can be directed at the reporting of the trial process or the 
verdicts.    However  the  reality  is  that  once  the  defendants  were  acquitted,  the  rule 
against  double  jeopardy  meant  that  there  was  no  prospect  of  a  second  trial  for  the 
acquitted  men,  and  as  a  matter  of  reality,  no  realistic  prospect  of  any  trial  of  the 
 
remaining two of the original suspects. There was no reason at all for any newspaper 
or television company to be circumspect in its reports and comments, or, subject only 
to the laws of defamation, to hold back from expressing robust views about the case, 
or  the  investigative  process,  or  even  the  identity  of  those  believed  to  have  been 
involved in or responsible for the death of Stephen Lawrence.  The enactment of the 
 
2003 Act, as we have explained, abrogated the rule against double jeopardy, and in 
the strictly limited situations identified by ss 77 and 78 of the 2003 Act, the court was 
vested with jurisdiction to quash an acquittal and order a new trial.  By then, however, 
 
the case was more than a decade old, and until recently there was nothing to suggest 
that evidence might emerge which could bring this particular case within the ambit of 
the  new  statutory  arrangements.    Indeed  the  overwhelming  proportion  of  material 
 
drawn to our attention entered the public arena before 2002. 

 

 

News  “spikes”  have  continued  since  the  collapse  of  the  prosecution  in  April  1996. 
Particular features which re-ignited media attention took place in February 1997 when 
the  five  original  suspects  gave  evidence  at  the  inquest  into  the  death  of  Stephen 
Lawrence, in June 1998 when all five attended the well known Macpherson Inquiry, 
and again in February 1999 when the Inquiry’s report became available; in April 1999 
when  the  five  suspects  gave  television  interviews,  denying  any  involvement  in 
Stephen Lawrence’s death, and in the case of Dobson, also gave a radio interview; in 
Spring  2000  a  BBC  Crimewatch  programme  about  the  case  attracted  a  further 
“spike”;  in  July  2006  BBC  Television  broadcast  a  documentary  about  the  five 
suspects entitled “The Boys Who Killed Stephen Lawrence”; in November 2007 there 
 
were reports of a forensic breakthrough in the case, and in July 2010 further reports 
 
were published about recent developments in the investigation. 

 
81.	 

 
82.	 

Quite  apart  from  these  “spikes”  the  Daily  Mail,  which  appears  to  have  taken  a 
particular interest in this case, alleged in express terms on 14 February 1997 that the 
five suspects were “murderers”, directly accusing them of involvement in the murder, 
and  challenging  them  to  sue  for  libel  if  the  allegations  were  wrong.    The  same 
 
headline appeared on the front page of the Daily Mail on 27 July 2006, immediately 
after the broadcast of the documentary The Boys Who Killed Stephen Lawrence. 

 

83.	  Mr  Roberts  identified  two  strands  to  the  publicity,  the  first  of  which    involved 
allegations of discreditable or criminal conduct or facts connected with one or other of 
the original suspects detrimental to them, and the second, expressions of opinion that 
 
they, or some of them, were indeed responsible for the attack on Stephen Lawrence 
and guilty of his murder.  He suggested, too, that some of the publicity followed a
--------

deliberate  attempt  to  attract  publicity  to  the  work  that  was  being  done  by  those 
responsible for the new investigation, LGC.  We have examined the material with the 
 
submission in mind, and accept that without over-compartmentalisation, the strands 
identified by Mr Roberts are clear, and, that the deliberate attempt to seek publicity at 
the time (whether by LGC, or someone else) was inappropriate.      

The issue is stark.  The question is not whether the publicity over the years was wise 
 
or ill-advised, but whether now, or at the date when the new trial, if ordered, would 
take place, the impact of that publicity would make a fair trial unlikely.  Mr Roberts 
submitted  that  the  effect  of  the  publicity  would  be  to  prejudice  any  future  juror, 
perhaps without the juror in question even appreciating that he or she had unconscious 
prejudice against any of the original suspects.  The effect would be insurmountable. 
 
Mr Mark Ellison QC for whose equally careful submissions we are no less indebted, 
accepted  that  over  the  years  there  had  been  publicity  for  the  case  which  was 
 
potentially prejudicial to the suspects, but he argued that the difficulties identified by 
 
Mr Roberts could and would be dispelled by appropriate judicial direction, in a trial in 
which  the  emotional  aspects  of  the  case  would  quickly  give  way  to  the  practical 
reality  that  the  jury  would  have  to  concentrate  on  the  new  scientific  findings,  the 
 
circumstances in which they were made, and the weight to be attached to them in the 
light of the defence case that post-incident contamination could not be excluded. 

If Mr Roberts is right, whatever new evidence may emerge, however powerful it may 
be, neither of the two original suspects who have not faced trial could ever face trial, 
nor  could  any  of  the  three  original  suspects  who  have  been  tried  and  acquitted,  be 
made the subject of a successful application for the acquittal to be quashed and a new 
 
trial ordered.  That is because, on Mr Roberts’s contention, any further trial, however 
carefully managed, regardless of the directions given by the judge, would be unlikely 
to  be  fair.    In  effect  therefore,  if  he  is  right,  the  publicity  over  the  years  has  now 
created  an  ineradicable  prejudice  against  them  with  the  result  that  they  have  been 
immunised against the risk of prosecution.  That would indeed be a remarkable result.   

 

Our conclusion is a matter of impression based on a careful analysis of the material 
which contains the potentially prejudicial publicity and ultimately judgment.  Among 
the potential jurors there are bound to be many who will have memories about this 
case and about the killing of this particular young man in the street, and many of them 
will be alert to the unrequited anguish of his parents and his family.  Some are likely 
to have an abiding impression that no one has yet been brought to justice, and to that 
extent, that justice has not been served.  A few may remember that some in the media 
 
have asserted that the original five suspects were responsible for Stephen Lawrence’s 
death  and  therefore  guilty  of  murder.    In  short,  as  in  Montgomery  v  HM  Advocate 
[2003] 1 AC 641: 

“…the  risk  that  the  widespread,  prolonged  and  prejudicial 
 
publicity that occurred in this case will have a residual effect on 
the  minds  of  at  least  some  members  of  the  jury  cannot  be 
regarded as negligible.”  (per Lord Hope of Craighead) 

That however does not decide the question.

87.	 

In his speech Lord Hope went on to analyse the safeguards which in such cases are 
provided to ensure the objective impartiality of the trial, the trial process itself and the 
conduct of the trial by the judge.  He described how: 

“On the one hand there is the discipline to which the jury was 
subjected of listening to and thinking about the evidence.  The 
actions of seeing and hearing the witnesses may be expected to 
have  a  far  greater  impact  on  their  minds  than  such  residual 
recollection  as  may  exist  about  reports  about  the  case  in  the 
 
media.    This  impact  can  be  expected  to  be  reinforced  on  the 
other  hand  by  such  warnings  and  directions  as  the  trial  judge 
may think appropriate to give them as the trial proceeds…the 
entire system of trial by jury is based upon the assumption that 
the jury will follow the instructions which they receive from the 
trial judge and that they will return a true verdict in accordance 
with the evidence.” 

 
88.	 

The same approach was adopted by Lord Phillips CJ in R v Abu Hamza [2007] 1 Cr 
 
App R27 at 371 where he acknowledged: 

“Prejudicial  publicity  renders  more  difficult  the  task  of  the 
 
court,  that  is  of  the  judge  and  the  jury  together,  in  trying  the 
case fairly.” 

However he continued: 

“The  fact,  however,  that  adverse  publicity  may  have  risked 
prejudicing a fair trial is no reason for not proceeding with the 
trial if the judge concludes that, with his assistance, it will be 
possible to have a fair trial.” 

 
89.	 

 
90.	 

The report includes detailed extracts of the approach of the trial judge, Hughes J (as 
 
he then was) which may be of assistance to the trial judge in the present case. 

The  final  consideration  in  our  assessment  is  to  repeat  the  feature  of  trial  by  jury 
identified in Re B [2006] EWCA Crim 2692:   

“…which is sometimes overlooked or taken for granted…that 
juries up and down the country have a passionate and profound 
belief in, and a commitment to, the right of a defendant to be 
given  a  fair  trial.  They  know  that  it  is  integral  to  their 
responsibilities.  It is, when all is said and done, their birthright; 
it  is  shared  by  each  one  of  them  with  the  defendant.    They 
guard  it  faithfully.    The  integrity  of  the  jury  is  an  essential 
feature of our trial process.  Juries follow the directions which 
the judge will give them to focus exclusively on the evidence 
and  to  ignore  anything  they  may  have  heard  or  read  out  of 
court…we  cannot  too  strongly  emphasise  that  the  jury  will 
follow  (appropriate  directions),  not  only  because  they  will 
loyally abide by the directions of law which they will be given 
by  the  judge,  but  also  because  the  directions  themselves  will

appeal directly to their own instinctive and fundamental belief 
in the need for the trial process to be fair.” 

 
91.	 

Having  reflected  carefully  on  the  submission  made  by  Mr  Roberts,  we  have 
 
 
concluded  that  a  fair  trial  can  take  place,  or  putting  it  another  way,  that  the  vast 
publicity relating to this particular case is unlikely to render the subsequent properly 
conducted trial unfair. 

Delay 

 

92.	  We have described the processes undertaken in 1993, and how this new evidence has 
come to light.  The delay is significant, but we can find no real prejudice to the proper 
preparation and conduct of the defence arising from the delay.  As to whether the new 
evidence could have been adduced in the earlier proceedings, although we accept that 
there  was  an  absence  of  diligence  or  expedition  in  the  earlier  part  of  the 
 
investigations, we have explained why and how the new evidence emerged, and are 
satisfied  that  even  with  proper  diligence,  the  evidence  which  has  now  become 
available would not have been appreciated at that time. 

Conclusion 

 
93.	 

The  application  by  the  Director  of  Public  Prosecutions  for  an  order  to  quash  the 
acquittal  of  Gary  Dobson  on  25th  April  1996  will  be  granted,  the  acquittal  will  be 
quashed and a new trial will be ordered.

HH JUDGE PETER THORNTON QC   

SENTENCING REMARKS                                   

        

 
REGINA v GORDON THOMPSON 

 

1. 	 Gordon THOMPSON  - You have pleaded guilty to three counts of burglary and 

one count of arson being reckless as to whether life would be endangered. All 
four charges arise out of the riots in Croydon on 8 August 2011. 

 
2. 	 That day was a bad day for Croydon and the people of Croydon. Shops were 
broken into and looted, a bus was attacked and set on fire, groups of people 
roamed the streets looking for trouble, missiles were thrown, bystanders were 
threatened and, perhaps the most shocking event of all, the House of Reeves 
furniture store was set alight and burned to the ground, putting lives at risk. That 
is the factual context in which your involvement must be considered. 

 
3. 	 First, you, with many others, looted the Iceland store in Surrey Street, stealing 

bottles of alcohol which you proudly displayed outside, leading to your 
photograph being displayed on the front of the Croydon Advertiser. That is the 
burglary in Count 2 on the original indictment. All references to Counts will relate 
to that indictment. 

 
4. 	 Then an hour or so later the Centrale shopping centre was broken into. The 

numbers of people who rushed in were so great that the security officers could do 
nothing but stand back and watch. You and a large group waited across the road 
until the centre was ripe for looting. Then you went in and up to the first floor to 
the House of Fraser. You helped hold the shutters up for others to enter and then 
went in yourself and stole from the store (burglary, Count 3). The cctv footage 
shows a truly shocking stream of people, mostly young, younger than you, 
entering and leaving the store with clothing and jewellery, some returning more 
than once. You were a part of that looting. When the police arrived the mob fled, 
scattering stolen goods all over the pavement and roadway. 
 

 
5. 	 Some 20 minutes later you are seen outside the House of Reeves, your 

distinctive red top bulging with stolen goods. This is - was - a landmark store, a 
furniture store of the Reeves family business which had stood on that site for over 

 

1
--------
140 years, proudly giving its name to its location, Reeves Corner. You were about 
to bring all that to an end. First, you pulled out the glass window which somebody 
else had shattered. You were one of the first to enter the shop. From inside you 
stole a laptop (burglary, Count 4), then left the store and handed it to somebody 
else. 

 
6. 	 Then you were heard by an eyewitness to say: ‘Let’s burn the place’, and you 

asked, ‘Who’s got a lighter?’ A lighter was handed to you. You walked back to the 
shop window, leant in on your own and made two attempts to set fire to a sofa 
inside. The cctv catches the flash of the lighter on each occasion. The second 
attempt was successful (arson, Count 6). The sofa - then the shop - was quickly 
alight. Meanwhile you stood back and watched. Mobile telephone footage seems 
to show you celebrating what you had done. You certainly boasted to another 
eyewitness with these words: ‘It was me, I did that, I burned Reeves Corner’. 
While House of Reeves burned to the ground you left with your looted 
possessions. 

 
7. 	 By your plea of guilty to arson being reckless as to whether life would be 

endangered you knew when you clicked the lighter that there was a risk that lives 
would be put at risk, but you nevertheless went ahead and took that risk. This 
was a deliberate, wilful act of shocking, dangerous vandalism. 

 

 
8. 	 The fire was devastating as you must have realised to some extent that it would 
be. In cold money terms the damage to the building was over £1 million, a figure 
now assessed with consequential loss approaching £3 million. In the road the fire 
was so intense that the tramlines melted, with a repair cost of nearly £330,000. 

 
9. 	 But the real cost was in human and emotional terms. The Reeves family lost their 

historic business, something they, and generations before them, had lived and 
worked for all their lives. Their loss was priceless. The trauma they have suffered 
is inestimable. Furthermore, the lives of local residents were put seriously at risk. 
The flames reached across the road, where there were numerous flats above the 
shops. Monika Konczyk, for example, had to jump out of a window to safety. She 
jumped because she believed she would die from the fire. The image of her 
falling went round the world’s press. Other neighbours had their windows blown 
out and smoke poured in, just as dangerous as fire. The police were banging on 
doors to get residents out. Hira Latif’s three year old child was screaming with 
fear; her two year old was terrified. Adults and children alike were crying in 
distress. Another witness, Mark Atkinson, fled his flat just in time; everything he 
owned was destroyed. Some of the residents, from statements I have read, 
suffered sleepless nights, were afraid to go out and their close relationships 
suffered badly afterwards. All of this makes this charge so serious. It is extreme 
good fortune, and no thanks to you, that nobody died or was seriously injured. But 
they will be scarred emotionally, for a long time. 

 
10. All in all this was a course of criminal conduct by you on a grand scale and in the 

context of widespread lawlessness. As the Lord Chief Justice said in R v 
Blackshaw [2011] EWCA Crim 2312: ‘Those who deliberately participate in 
disturbances of this magnitude, causing injury and damage and fear to even the 
most stout-hearted of citizens, and who individually commit further crimes during 
the course of the riots are committing aggravated crimes. They must be punished 
accordingly, and the sentences should be designed to deter others from similar 
criminal activity.’ 

 

 

2
--------
11. For the purpose of sentence your admitted conduct is also aggravated by your 

many previous convictions. You are 34 years of age and have convictions on 20 
separate occasions including a robbery in 2000 when you were involved with 
others who were armed with knives and a machete in a violent robbery in North 
London. 

 
12. There is little mitigation in your favour except for the following. First you pleaded 
guilty at an earlier stage to the Iceland and House of Fraser burglaries, and you 
pleaded guilty to the House of Reeves offences on the second day of your trial, 
immediately after the prosecution opening. You must have due credit for your 
pleas of guilty. Second, no witness had to give evidence and some of them were 
understandably fearful about coming forward. Third, you have expressed some 
remorse for destroying the Reeves family business. Fourth, I am grateful to your 
counsel for his helpful submissions. These matters will all count in your favour. 

 
13. I am satisfied, inevitably, that the custody threshold is passed. The sentence I am 
about to pass is the least sentence that the gravity of these offences demands in 
all the circumstances, taking account of the aggravating and mitigating factors, 
and considering the sentencing authorities on burglary and arson including the 
case of Blackshaw on riot offences. I have also considered the decision of HH 
Judge Chapple in the case of Burls (Inner London Crown Court, 20 February 
2012), and the Sentencing Council Guideline on burglary. 

 
14. I have heard submissions about an indeterminate sentence. My conclusion is this. 

Although the public is clearly at risk in the future from some harm caused by you 
(as the Pre-Sentence Report spells out), I am not entirely convinced that the 
relevant provisions of Chapter 5 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 apply. The 
offences, particularly the arson, were committed in a wholly unusual context, 
unlikely to recur again. You have not committed this kind of offence before. And 
the Pre-Sentence Report, although addressing risk and harm, never actually uses 
the phrase ‘serious harm’. I shall therefore pass a determinate sentence. 
 

 
15. First, Count 6, arson being reckless as to whether life would be endangered. My 

starting point is 13 years imprisonment, reduced by a little more than 10% for 
your very late plea of guilty to 11 ½ years. That sentence is loaded to reflect the 
aggravating features of burglary at the same premises and the two earlier 
burglaries, all part of one course of unlawful conduct on the same evening. Hence 
the other sentences (which are deliberately outside the guidelines because they 
are repeated looting offences) will be concurrent. They are: 2 years imprisonment 
for each of the burglaries in Counts 2 and 3 and 3 years for the burglary on Count 
4 (each reduced to that figure by your guilty pleas). That makes a total sentence 
of 11 ½ years imprisonment in all. 

 
16. I order that all days spent in custody will be deducted from that sentence. At 
present the number of days is estimated at 241 days. Should that number be 
incorrect, it can be altered administratively.  

 
17. In the ordinary way you will be released after you have served half of your 

sentence, and then be on licence for the remainder. If you offend again or breach 
the terms of your licence you may be returned to prison.  

 
18. In the circumstances compensation is not appropriate, nor are prosecution and 

defence recovery costs.

Janet Chapman, you are to be sentenced for a serious contempt of court committed 
by you whilst you were a juror in a trial in this building presided over by His Honour 
Judge Baker. 
 
The case was a serious one involving allegations of robberies of cash in transit 
vehicles. The case lasted about 4 weeks. At the beginning of the trial the judge 
 
informed potential members of the jury of the anticipated length of the case and gave 
jurors who might not be able to serve for that period of time an opportunity to make 
 
representations that they should be excused from serving on the jury. A document 
was provided to the jury panel which included this request: 
 
“If there is any reason why you would not be able to serve on the jury in this case (eg 
 
because of a pre-booked and pre-paid holiday, or admission to hospital) please 
 
indicate the reason(s):…” 
 
I have before me the form you returned which indicated that there was no reason why 
 
you should not serve on the jury and you were selected in the ballot. 
 
The case lasted its anticipated time and on the morning of the Monday of the fourth 
 
week, Monday 19th March 2012, you did not appear at court. You contacted the court 
that morning and said you were unfit to attend. On Tuesday 20th March a telephone 
 
message was left by you on the number provided to jurors, which is that of the Jury 
 
Bailiff, in these terms: 
 
“Hello, this is Janet Chapman Juror Number ***. I won’t be attending court for a 
 
period of up to two weeks. I have got to return to the doctors next Tuesday. I have got 
sciatica. Thank you. Bye” 
 
 
This call was made from Malta. 
 
In fact on that Tuesday morning you were at Liverpool Airport – a car registered to 
your address was in the vicinity of the airport at 05.42 a.m. – and you boarded a 
flight which departed Liverpool Airport at 08.15 for Malta, and were to stay there for 
a week. The message you left at the court was misleading and a deliberate deception.
--------
Meanwhile enquires were made at your home and in the vicinity to try to discover 
your whereabouts. Enquiries were made of your doctor and it was discovered that 
you had visited the surgery on Monday 19th March complaining of a back related 
 
problem and a sick note was issued for 7 days. However you were not at home as 
would be expected to be the case if you were off sick for this reason, and whilst such a 
complaint might be sufficient to be off work it would not necessarily preclude you 
from performing jury service, and as you were able to endure a flight to Malta and 
enjoy a holiday there it is quite clear to me that you were not unfit to continue your 
 
duties as a juror on medical grounds. I am satisfied that if you really suffered back 
pain of such severity that you could not continue your jury service you would not 
have been able to endure the travel to Malta. I am driven to the conclusion that you 
 
pretended to your doctor that you had a back problem in order that you could take a 
holiday in Malta. As Mr McEntee pointed out in cross-examining you, back pain is 
something which is easily feigned. 
 
Your assertion to the police when you were arrested on your return to the United 
 
Kingdom that you were unaware that you could not go away on holiday whilst absent 
from jury duty due to what you maintain was illness is ludicrous. If you were too ill to 
attend court you were not fit to travel to Malta for the holiday. I do not accept the 
evidence and mitigation which has been put forward on your behalf and I specifically 
reject the assertion made on your behalf that by telephoning the court and informing 
 
the court of your supposed illness you thought that you had done all you needed to do 
and that there was nothing wrong with going to Malta – this was not the action of a 
responsible person. 
 
As a result of your actions the trial was delayed for two days while enquiries were 
made. There was genuine concern at first for your welfare. Extensive police enquiries 
were made which have cost the taxpayer considerable expense which should not have 
 
been incurred. The two day delay to the trial has resulted in significant wasted costs, 
 
personal loss to several people and considerable inconvenience. After this delay and 
wasted time Judge Baker discharged you from the jury in your absence and the trial 
continued. It is important to note that when a trial has to continue with a reduced 
 
number of jurors this can mean that it is more difficult for a result to be achieved and 
sometimes a retrial may have to be ordered.  
 
Jury service is one of the most important public duties that a citizen of this country 
can be called upon to perform. It is inconvenient, but an essential part of our 
 
democratic system. It is essential that the duty of jury service is taken seriously by 
 
those called upon to perform it, and that it is performed diligently and responsibility. 
 
You have manifestly failed to perform your public duty. Further it is clear that you 
deliberately deceived the court for your own ends and pleasure, namely taking a 
holiday in Malta. 
 
In my judgement this is a serious contempt of court which can only be met by an 
immediate sentence of imprisonment. 
 
The sentence of the court is 56 days imprisonment of which you will serve up to half.",2012-04-05 00:00:00,UK Crown Court

The Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales: 
 

A -v- R 

 
1.	 

This is an appeal against conviction by A following her plea of guilty at Mold Crown 
Court on 15th October 2010, to doing acts tending and intended to pervert the course 
of public justice, contrary to common law. For the sake of preserving her anonymity 
she  has  been  identified  by  the  media  during  these  proceedings  as  “Sarah”.    The 
particulars of offence alleged that between 7th February 2010 and 30th July 2010, with 
 
the  necessary  intent,  she  did  a  series  of  acts  which  had  a  tendency  to  pervert  the 
course of public justice by making and pursuing false retractions of her complaints of 
rape  against  her  husband. 
She  was  sentenced  to  8  months  imprisonment.    The 
sentence was quashed in this court on 23rd November 2010, and replaced with a non-
custodial sentence.  The judgment of the court is set out at [2010] EWCA Crim. 2913. 
 
By the time the sentence was quashed, the appellant had already been in custody for 3 
weeks, and her own personal position, as well as that of her four children, had become 
 
so uncertain and problematic that the court, as then constituted, believed that it would 
be  of  positive  assistance  to  all  of  them  to  make  a  community  based  order,  taking 
 
immediate effect.  If the situation had been different, the likely order, given that the 
 
appellant  had  already  been  in  custody  for  3  weeks,  would  have  been  an  order  for 
conditional discharge. 

 

The appeal against sentence 

Dealing with it very briefly at this stage, the prosecution of the appellant began with 
her  complaint  that  her  husband  had  raped  her.    In  due  course  she  withdrew  that 
complaint.    She  then  proceeded  to  assert  and  reassert  that  her  complaint  had  been 
false.  Proceedings against him were stopped.  She was prosecuted for perverting the 
course  of  justice  by  making  a  false  complaint  of  rape.    In  due  course,  having  seen 
counsel and solicitor, she reasserted the truth of the original complaint.  In due course, 
on 15th October 2010, she faced two indictments at Mold Crown Court, both of which 
alleged that she had perverted the course of public justice.  Although the statement of 
offence  in  each  indictment  was  identical,  the  particulars  of  offence  were  mutually 
 
contradictory.  The  first  indictment  alleged  that  she  had  made  and  pursued  false 
allegations of rape against her husband, the second that she had made and pursued a 
 
false retraction of these allegations.  She pleaded not guilty to the first indictment, and 
guilty to the second.  The Crown offered no evidence on the first indictment.  She was 
acquitted  by  order  of  the  judge  and  a  “not  guilty”  verdict  was  entered.    On  5th 
 
November she was sentenced and shortly afterwards the sentence was quashed 

The appellant was therefore convicted of making false retractions of a most serious 
allegation of sexual crime when she would otherwise have been in a position to assist 
the Crown to prosecute the perpetrator to conviction.  On this basis she deliberately 
enabled  her  husband  to  escape  justice  for  the  crime  of  rape  for  which  she  was  the 
victim.  On both occasions when the case has been before this court, the prosecution 
 
has proceeded on the basis that the allegations of rape and domestic abuse suffered by 
the appellant at the hands of her husband were true.  We shall proceed on the same 
basis.  Nevertheless  it  is  only  fair  to  the  appellant’s  husband  to  record  that  he  has 
consistently  denied  the  allegations  and  has  not  had  any  opportunity  publicly  to 
challenge or refute them.   

During  the  course  of  the  judgment  on  her  appeal  against  sentence,  a  number  of 
observations were made in this court:   

 
2.	 

 
3.	 

 
4.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

A -v- R 

“… a complaint that an individual has been the victim of crime 
is not, and never has been, merely a private matter between the 
complainant  and  the  alleged  perpetrator  of  the  crime.    Every 
crime  engages  the  community  at  large.    There  is  a  distinct 
 
public  interest  in  the  investigation  and,  if  appropriate,  the 
prosecution  and  conviction  of  those  who  have  committed 
crimes.  …  an  unconvicted  criminal  is  free  to  continue  to 
commit crime and to add to the list of his victims, as well as to 
 
escape justice.  Therefore, perverting the course of justice is not 
confined  to  making  and  pursuing  false  allegations  or  giving 
false  evidence,  which  is  always  a  very  serious  offence.    It 
extends to the retraction of truthful allegations or the retraction 
 
of truthful evidence. …”. 

 
5.	 

Critical features of mitigation were then addressed:   

“The  different  between  the  culpability  of  the  individual  who 
instigates  a  false  complaint  against  an  innocent  man  and  the 
complainant who retracts a truthful allegation against a guilty 
man  will  often  be  very  marked.    Experience  shows  that  the 
withdrawal  of  a  truthful  complaint  of  crime  committed  in  a 
domestic environment usually stems from pressures, sometimes 
direct, sometimes indirect, sometimes immensely subtle, which 
are consequent on the nature of the individual relationship and 
the characters of the people who are involved in it.  Where a 
woman  has  been  raped,  and  raped  more  than  once  by  her 
husband or partner, the father of her children, the man in whom 
she is entitled to repose her trust, those very actions reflect, and 
are often meant to reflect, manifestations of dominance, power 
and  control  over  her.  When  these  features  of  a  relationship 
between a man and a woman are established, it is an inevitable 
consequence  that  the  woman  who  has  been  so  ill-treated 
becomes extremely vulnerable. 

Of course it is better for a truthful complaint to be pursued, but 
if  the  proposal  that  it  should  be  withdrawn  is  not  accepted, 
leading to a positive retraction and admission that the original 
truthful  complaint  was  untrue,  and  the  complainant  is  then 
prosecuted to conviction, the sentencing court, when assessing 
culpability,  should  recognise  and  allow  for  the  pressures  to 
which the truthful complainant in such a relationship has been 
 
exposed,  and  should  be  guided  by  a  broad  measure  of 
compassion for a woman who has already been victimised.” 

The case attracted a good deal of understandable public interest, and indeed concern. 
  
It was reported in The Guardian newspaper on 16 December 2010 that the Director of 
Public  Prosecutions,  referring  to  the  need  of  the  Crown  Prosecution  Service  to 
organise an improvement in their handling of retraction cases, and plainly referring to 
this  particular  case,  said  that  he  did  not  consider  “justice  was  done  or  seen  to  be 
 
done”.  Unsurprisingly Mr Niall Quinn QC on behalf of the appellant highlighted this

7.	 

comment,  and  used  it  to  develop  his  submission  that  the  conviction  should  be 
regarded as unsafe. 

Thereafter, following a detailed consultation exercise, fresh Guidance was published 
by the Crown Prosecution Service.  If this Guidance had been in force at the date of 
the appellant’s conviction, on the basis of the evidence that she had been raped and 
subjected  to  other  domestic  violence  over  a  long  period  and  that  this  had  had  a 
damaging effect on her health, she would, as Miss Alison Levitt QC for the Crown 
accepted, in all likelihood, not have been prosecuted.  Mr Quinn suggested that it was 
not simply that a prosecution to conviction would have been unlikely, but rather, the 
appeal should be approached on the basis that she would not have been prosecuted at 
all. 

The appeal against conviction 

 
8.	 

 

The entire case has now been re-examined.  The solicitors and counsel who acted on 
behalf of the appellant have provided the appellant’s new legal advisors with all the 
material  available  to  them,  and  commented  on  the  facts  which  confronted  them. 
Further  detailed  instructions  have  been  obtained  from  the  appellant.    A  number  of 
witnesses  who  support  her  account  of  the  ill  treatment  to  which  she  was  subjected 
have  provided  statements.    Recently  she  was  examined  by  Roger  Hutchinson,  a 
consultant  forensic  clinical  psychologist.  Based  on  a  rather  developed  account  of 
 
events provided to him by the appellant herself, and, as far as we can see, without 
dealing with all the material available to us, he concluded that during the latter part of 
her relationship with her husband the appellant was experiencing post traumatic stress 
disorder,  and  that  this  condition  persisted  at  the  time  when  she  retracted  the 
allegations  of  rape,  and  indeed  still  continue.    Based  on  this  material  Mr  Quinn 
submitted that crucial evidence was not properly examined or considered before the 
 
appellant  pleaded  guilty,  and  that  if  it  had  been,  she  had  a  viable  defence  to  the 
charge,  in  the  form  of  duress  and,  initially  at  any  rate,  although  it  was  rightly 
abandoned at the hearing of the appeal, marital coercion.  The issue of duress in the 
form of the physical, sexual and mental abuse inflicted on her is at the heart of the 
appeal, and we shall examine the evidence closely, omitting a degree of Mr Quinn’s 
 
forensic  overstatement  from  our  analysis.    Mr  Quinn  further  suggested  that  all  this 
 
material  revealed  that  the  decision  to  prosecute  the  appellant  followed  failings  by 
everyone concerned in the process which culminated in the sentence imposed at Mold 
Crown Court, and constituted an inexplicable and inappropriate exercise of the well 
 
established prosecutorial discretion which required that she should not be prosecuted 
at all.  In short, he submitted that if all the relevant facts had been properly considered 
 
the prosecution would not have gone ahead, or would have been stayed on application 
to the court. 
 

 
9.	 

For present purposes, we shall not distinguish between evidence which was available 
prior to conviction, and material relating to the period before  conviction which has 
emerged subsequently, which we considered de bene esse. In the end, subject to the 
reservations expressed in the course of the judgment, we admitted the evidence. 

The facts 

 
10.	 

The narrative begins on 28th November 2009 when the appellant reported that she had 
just been raped by her husband and had been raped by him on two earlier occasions.

A -v- R 

She was quickly relocated to the Women’s Refuge with her four children and he was 
immediately arrested.  He denied the offence.  On the following day she was video 
interviewed.  She gave a detailed account of rape. He was interviewed and maintained 
his  denials.  He  was  then  charged  with  rape  and  remanded  in  custody.    On  the 
following day she was video interviewed.  She made detailed complaints.  He, too, 
was further interviewed and maintained his denials. 

On 30th November the husband was remanded in custody by the Magistrates Court 
and the case was sent to the Crown Court.  A few days later he made an application 
for bail to the Crown Court.  This was refused. 

On 10th December a preliminary hearing took place at Mold Crown Court.  Mr A was 
 
released on conditional bail, with a specific condition that he should not directly or 
indirectly contact any prosecution witness. 

During the course of the police investigations the appellant was provided with support 
and assistance.  She was assisted by the Montgomeryshire Family Crisis Centre and 
referred to Powys Social Services.  She was in telephone contact with Victim Support. 
  
In connection with possible counselling, she was advised to seek assistance from her 
 
medical practice. 

On 21st December it was reported that the appellant wished to withdraw her allegation 
of rape against her husband.  The police contacted Victim Support Service to establish 
whether any problems had been reported to them.  The investigating officer was told 
 
that none had been mentioned.  During the Christmas period there was something of a 
reconciliation. Sexual intercourse took place between the husband and wife.  This was 
 
not  rape,  nor  even  reluctant  acquiescence,  but  consensual  sexual  intercourse.    It 
happened because, in her reported words, she “wanted” to. Throughout this period she 
must have been aware that her husband was in breach of the bail condition that he 
 
should have no communication or contact with her.  The only realistic conclusion is 
  
that she connived at it.  She now finds it difficult to explain her behaviour at this time. 
It does however provide the contextual background to the submission by Mr Quinn 
that there was a viable defence of duress open to the appellant. 

 

On 7th January 2010, the appellant contacted the police to withdraw her complaint. A 
 
further video interview was conducted with her.  She made clear that she wished to 
withdraw  her  complaint  of  rape  against  her  husband  and  that  she  did  not  want  to 
attend court.  She indicated that she wanted to put everything behind her and move 
forward for her own sake and the sake of her children.  She did however confirm that 
 
her  relationship  with  her  husband  had  ended,  and  she  confirmed  that  all  of  her 
allegations were true.  It was explained to her that, even if she wished to withdraw the 
complaint, the case might still proceed and that if it did she might be required to give 
evidence.  In answer to the specific question why she was withdrawing the complaint, 
the contemporaneous notes record that “(she) states that nobody has put any pressure 
on  her”.  She  confirmed  that  she  had  “engaged  with  Victim  Support  and  received 
emotional support.  The Montgomery Family Crisis Centre has also been involved”. 

 

On 14th January, following a case conference to assess this development, the appellant 
was informed that the prosecution would proceed.  She was invited to a meeting at 
Mold Crown Court on 18th January when a plea and case management hearing was 
 
due to take place.  The husband pleaded not guilty to the counts of rape and the trial

was fixed for the week of 4th May.  In the meantime the appellant met the prosecution 
 
 
team at Mold Crown Court.  She admitted to them that she had been in contact with 
her  husband  over  the  Christmas  period.    A  signed  statement  outlining  the  contact 
 
which had taken place was obtained from her.  She admitted that she had had sexual 
 
intercourse with him, consensually, on a number of occasions during the Christmas 
period, and she pleaded with the police not to arrest her husband, notwithstanding that 
 
he was in breach of his bail conditions, as this would make the situation worse.  She 
said  that  everything  had  been  done  for  her  children  so  they  could  enjoy  their 
Christmas.  Her husband’s solicitor was informed of the breach of bail and told that in 
the circumstances, instead of arresting him, he would receive a warning. 

On  23rd  January  the  appellant  telephoned  DS  Whitgreave  and  said  that  she  had 
received a series of abusive text messages from her husband.  Later that day she sent 
the police officer a text message to the effect that she had had a very low day, having 
 
found out that her husband had been seen out with another woman.  She went on that 
she had complained about her husband’s texting in order to “spite him”.  There was 
no excuse for what she had done but it had been a “very tough few days” for her.  She 
 
had  calmed  down  and  had  time  to  think  about  it.    She  was  sorry  for  having  done 
 
 
something  so  stupid.    When  this  text  message  was  followed  up  by  the  police  the 
appellant admitted that she had not received any text messages from her husband and 
that she had made up the story to get back at him.  There were understandable police 
 
concerns about her reliability as a potential witness. 

On 1st February the husband was involved in a road traffic collision.  It was believed 
 
that  his  front  seat  passenger  was  his  wife.    The  collision  occurred  in  an  area  from 
 
which he was excluded by his bail conditions, and obviously, his contact with his wife 
constituted a further breach.  In view of the earlier warning, on 5th February he was 
arrested and remanded in custody.   

On 7th February, while he was in custody, the appellant made her first false retraction. 
 
She telephoned the police asking to speak to the investigating officer, and when the 
 
officer telephoned her back, the first thing she said was “that’s it, it’s over what is 
going  to  happen  if  I  now  say  I  made  it  all  up,  I  have  lied  about  the  rapes.    I  lied 
because  Terry  would  not  let  me  go  and  work  in  the  place  again,  I  wanted  to  work 
there as I liked the money”.  She was referring to work in a massage parlour. 

 
During  this  conversation  the  appellant  was  aggressive  in  her  manner.  The  officer 
explained in clear terms that she needed to think very carefully about what she was 
saying.  She had to be sure that what she was saying was in fact the truth.  She said 
that  she  was  not  bothered  about  what  happened  to  her  and  didn’t  care  if  she  was 
charged or dealt with for “whatever offence”.  It was made clear to her that she could 
not get her own way. She was told that the CPS would have to be consulted and that 
 
when  a  decision  had  been  made  she  would  be  told.    She  was  informed  that  her 
husband would be at the Mold Crown Court on 9th February in connection with his 
 
breach of bail conditions. 

On 9th February the husband’s application for bail was refused.  On 11th February the 
 
appellant  attended  the  police  station  voluntarily,  to  tell  the  “truth”  about  the 
allegation.  She said that the rape allegations were lies which she had made up.  The 
 
police warned her of the potential seriousness having made false allegations of rape. 
 
She was given legal advice and cautioned.  A solicitor attended the police station to

represent and advise her.  The appellant provided a written statement to the police. 
 
She maintained that her allegations were false.  She explained her lies on the basis 
that her husband would not let her return to work in the massage parlour.  There were 
financial pressures, and she felt she had to get back to work quickly and earn some 
 
easy money to try and sort out the debts. 

 

22.	  Mr Quinn suggested that the explanation given by the appellant for her false story was 
such nonsense that an investigation by the police would have demonstrated that what 
she  was  saying  was  untrue.    With  respect,  that  is  a  little  too  easy:  the  entire 
prosecution case depended on the credibility of the appellant.  Notwithstanding the 
 
clear  warning  she  had  received  about  the  seriousness  of  her  position  this  was  the 
 
explanation  that  she  chose  to  provide  for her  false  allegations  against  her  husband. 
 
She was later to repeat and amplify it. 

 
23.

25.	 

On 12th February the husband appeared at Mold Crown Court.  The Crown offered no 
evidence against him.  In the circumstances there was no alternative.  Effectively that 
was the end of the rape allegation against him.  There was no possible justification for 
remanding him in custody.   

An  investigation  was  now  conducted  into  the  offence  admitted  by  the  appellant, 
namely  that  she  had  made  a  false  allegation  of  rape  against  her  husband.    On  16th 
 
 
April  she  was  arrested  on  suspicion  of  perverting  the  course  of  justice.    A  tape 
 
recorded interview in the presence of her solicitor took place. 

 
The appellant said in categoric terms that she was never raped by her husband.  She 
was  asked  to  explain  why  she  made  the  false  allegations,  and  it  is  clear  from  the 
record of the interview which we have studied, that the police were sympathetic, and 
offered  her  every  opportunity  to  deny  that  she  had  made  a  false  allegation.    They 
discussed whether her husband had put emotional pressure on her, whether she was 
concerned about the position of the children, and whether her support network was 
limited.  She was questioned whether he had convinced her to go to the police and 
 
withdraw the allegation, and whether he had an emotional hold over her.  She was 
 
asked whether she had received sufficient support from outside agencies. Even at that 
stage the police pointed out that if the allegations were true and what she was telling 
 
the police now, that is, that the retraction was the lie, she could still tell them about it. 
 
She was adamant.  The allegations were untrue.  She was responsible for them. She 
denied that she was withdrawing the complaint because of lack of support. 

 
26.	 

On 23rd June the appellant was charged with perverting the course of justice on the 
basis of her false allegation against her husband.  She was bailed. Her solicitor, Mr 
Sherrard, prepared her case.  On 13th July the case was sent to the Crown Court.  It 
was listed for a preliminary hearing on 23rd July. 

 

27.	  Mr Sherrard, reflecting his own personal concern, said directly to his client that the 
police  remained  “unconvinced”  that  her  original  complaint  was  a  false  one.    He 
believed that the police had charged her with the offence with some reluctance.   In 
his letter to her, he noted that she appeared to be in full command of her faculties, and 
he advised her that the police were “supposed to work hard to punish those who make 
 
false  allegations”,  but  they  may  also  consider  that  they  were  “unfairly  treating 
someone who was in fact a victim”.  She was later advised in writing, that a custodial 
 
penalty would normally follow conviction for perverting the course of justice, but the

ongoing relationship with her husband and children would be a significant factor in 
the  sentencing  decision.  Shortly  before  her  appearance  on  23rd  July  her  solicitors 
 
wrote to the Crown Court to inform the court that they might be in difficulty on that 
 
 
date because she had failed to respond to letters.  In explanation, they said that she 
was “extremely distracted by the turbulence in her life, to a very unusual degree, and 
she  previously  failed  to  keep  in  contact  whilst  on  police  bail,  but  nevertheless 
 
answered bail”.  Mr Sherrard briefed Mr Gordon Hennell of Counsel. 

 
28.	 

The  brief  to  Mr  Hennell  suggested  that  the  officers  involved  in  the  case  clearly 
believed that the allegations made by the appellant in November 2009 were true, and 
that they were guessing at the motive for her subsequent assertion that she had told 
lies.  He was expressly instructed that it did however appear to be accepted “at least 
that there is no improper pressure from (the husband) upon her”. 

 

29.	  Mr Hennell met the appellant for the first time on 30th July.  At first she told him that 
she planned to plead guilty to having made the false allegation of rape.  Those were 
her instructions to him.  If he had accepted them at face value she would have pleaded 
guilty to that charge.  Mr Hennell was sceptical and advised her in detail and without 
equivocation.  On  direct  questioning  she  admitted  that  she  had  indeed  been  raped. 
 
The  allegations  were  true.  The  case  was  relisted  for  a  preliminary  hearing  on  30th 
 
July.  Again Mr Hennell advised that if the allegation of rape was true, it would not be 
right  to  plead  guilty,  even  if  the  appellant  was  under  pressure  to  withdraw  the 
allegations because she wanted to be with her husband.  She needed to think about the 
position.  She did not need to make any decision on that day.  The advice that she 
should tell the truth was repeated in stark terms:  “stick with the truth”. 

30.	  Mr Hennell also advised her that a family lawyer should be instructed to consider a 

 

non-molestation order to prevent her husband contacting her  and the children. 

On 5th August the appellant contacted the police.  She said that she had come to her 
 
senses  and  that  she  had  in  fact  been  raped.    In  the  meantime  she  consulted  family 
 
lawyers  and  they  prepared  her  sworn  statement  dated  16th  August  in  proposed 
proceedings for a non-molestation and occupation order at Welshpool County Court. 
 
In the statement the appellant asserted that she had been subjected to domestic abuse 
and  had  indeed  been  raped  on  three  occasions.    As  to  her  reason  for  retracting  her 
 
allegations to this effect, she said that her husband “persuaded” her to do so on the 
basis that if she did “any punishment (she) would suffer would be considerably less 
than that he would be subject to.”  She added that her husband was able to control her. 

On  31st  August  she  was  arrested  and,  with  her  solicitor  present,  interviewed.    Her 
account in this interview is not consistent with any possible defence of duress.  She 
 
said that she had been told by someone, probably her husband’s sister, that if she said 
she had lied about the rape she would not go to prison, but as a single parent, would 
receive a suspended sentence.  However she said that when she spoke to the barrister 
 
at  court  he  had  told  her  that  she  would  receive  a  sentence  of  12  to  18  months 
imprisonment.  The significance of this became clear.  She had decided to be truthful 
and to accept that she had lied when she had said that the rapes had not happened. 
 
She was asked why she had not turned to Victim Support.  She said that she had, and 
that when she said to the lady in Victim Support that her husband had changed and 
was being very good with her, that he had altered and he was behaving very loving, 
she was advised to be very careful because he would revert to his old ways.  She was

asked  the  direct  question  why  she  felt  she  could  not  speak  to  the  police,  and  she 
responded that she did not know. 

 
33.	 

In this interview she said:  

“the  only  reason  why  I  said  I’d  lied  and  make  it  all  up  was 
 
because  I  had  pressure  put  on  me  and  I’d  been  advised  by 
somebody that if I said I was lying, I wouldn’t be sent to prison 
because I am a single mum and I’ve got 4 children.  That’s the 
reason why I said I was lying, because that’s what I presumed 
would happen.  I was told I would get a suspended sentence as 
they wouldn’t put the kids in care”.  

 
34.	 

She was asked: 

“When  Terry’s  sister  came  up  to  the  house,  whose  idea,  who 
first  started  sort  of  suggesting  things  to  try  and  help  with  the 
 
situation, because as you admitted, you weren’t sort of coping 
 
…” 

 
35.	 

The appellant replied 

“Well I thought about it, and I mentioned it to her on that day, 
and I said that the only thing that was holding me back is the 
 
fact that I am scared that if they arrest me, the kids and that’s 
when she said “don’t worry about the kids” …”. 

 
36.	 

She was asked whether anybody put her under pressure to phone that day and say that 
she had lied.  She responded: 

“I don’t know whether it was pressure or not.  Put it this way, 
Tracey wasn’t a regular visitor to the house and that visit was 
almost  a  bit  out  of  the  blue  and  I  haven’t  spoken  or  haven’t 
seen her since”. 

 
37.	 

She was asked directly whether her husband had put her under pressure to withdraw 
 
her allegations when she first did so.  She responded: 

“We  discussed  it  and  our  thinking  was  that  if,  because  I  had 
asked  my  solicitor  how  long  do  you  think  Terry  would  get 
inside and they said and I know Terry has told me this since, 
that his solicitor had said more or less, he’s get about 10 years, 
and  serve  half.  Then  we  discussed  about  me  ringing  up  and 
saying that I was lying and like he’d said and Tracey said as 
well, that it would be a suspended sentence for just like 2 or 3 
months.  And  then  me  sitting  there  stupidly  thinking  right, 
what’s best for the kids, Daddy missing for 5 years or Mummy 
missing for 3 months and that’s where them, yeh, …”. 

 
38. 

At  this  the  interviewing  officer  interrupted  and  made  an  extremely  pertinent 
 
observation:
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

“So you say, “our thinking”,… ” 

 
39.	 

And she responded: 

A -v- R 

“Sorry,  me  and  Terry  would  sit  down  and  discuss  this  and  I 
remember saying to him “look, Mummy disappearing for 2 or 3 
months  is  better  than  Daddy  disappearing  for  5  or  6  years”. 
And yeh, he wasn’t happy with the idea, but he didn’t stop me.” 

 

At the same time, with her consent, her solicitor provided the police with a copy of 
the statement made by her in support of her non-molestation application, proceedings 
which  had  not  yet  been  started.  He  believed  that  this  account  of  the  incidents  of 
domestic violence would greatly mitigate her culpability.  He suggested to the police 
that  as  everything  they  did  was  designed  to  assist  victims  and  prevent  what  had 
actually  happened  (that  is,  the  withdrawal  of  a  true  complaint)her  personal 
circumstances made her “particularly vulnerable”.   

On 16th September the appellant was charged with an additional offence of perverting 
the  course  of  justice  by  falsely  retracting  a  true  allegation  of  rape.    Her  solicitors 
 
obtained  her  authorisation  to  be  provided  with  her  medical  records  with  a  view  to 
obtaining a psychiatric or psychological report for her at the Crown Court.   

On  20th  September  the  appellant’s  husband  was  arrested  following  an  incident  in 
which he, in effect, forced entry into her home at about 5.30 – 6.00a.m.  She told her 
 
solicitors  that  she  was  not  assaulted,  but  the  “whole  process  put  her  in  fear”.    She 
called  the  police.  He  was  arrested.  The  incident  made  her  keen  to  pursue  an 
application  for  a  non-molestation  order.    She  agreed  to  make  a  witness  statement 
about the incident to the police.  She was now very keen to stop him ever going back 
 
to the home. Thereafter her husband was remanded on bail, with conditions that he 
should not contact her, whether directly or indirectly. 

In due course the appellant’s medical records were received from her doctor.  Apart 
from a brief mention of post-natal depression some 7 or 8 years earlier, the solicitor 
could  find  no  reference  to  depression  or  any  other  psychological  or  psychiatric 
problems,  therefore  he  did  not,  as  he  put  it  “progress  a  medical  report”  into  the 
appellant’s thinking during the relevant periods, at any rate until the issues had been 
discussed further with counsel. 

On  14th  October  a  conference  took  place  with counsel  in  his  chambers.    Advanced 
Disclosure made no mention of any investigation into pressure put upon the appellant 
by  her  husband  and  his  sister.  However  on  the  basis  of  her  own  instructions,  the 
 
appellant decided to plead not guilty to making a false allegation of rape, but guilty to 
 
making a false retraction of the allegation.  Mr Hennell advised that this meant that 
there  would  be  a  much  greater  chance  that  a  custodial  sentence  would  be  avoided. 
 
The proposed plea would be acceptable to the Crown.  He advised on the evidence to 
 
be put together for the purposes of the Pre-Sentence Report.   

On  15th  October  at  Mold  Crown  Court,  in  accordance  with  her  decision  on  the 
 
previous day, the appellant pleaded not guilty to the first indictment and guilty to the 
 
second  indictment.    The  prosecution  offered  no  further  evidence  on  the  first 
 
indictment.    A  Pre-Sentence  Report  was  ordered.    The  appellant’s  solicitors  sought

information  from  the  Crown  Prosecution  Service  whether  there  had  been  any 
investigation of pressure placed on the appellant to retract the original allegation, and 
the state of the investigation into his actions when he forced entry into her home, that 
is, the incident on 20th September. 

On  28th  October  the  husband  came  to  the  appellant’s  home.    During  his  visit  he 
 
attacked her.  According to her report he dragged her outside by her hair and began to 
tear her clothes off.  Much later she was to tell Mr Hutchinson that according to her 
husband she had ripped her own clothes off and caused some injury, and that when 
the  incident  was  investigated  the  police  told  her  that  her  husband  would  not  be 
arrested as there were not enough physical injuries to her body. 

The  Pre-Sentence  Report  was  completed  on  4th  November  2010.  This  gives  the 
appellant’s  account  of  her  marriage  which  was,  from  the  outset,  “turbulent”.    The 
appellant described her husband as “controlling” and “violent”, and the relationship 
was marred by a history of abuse.  Although she felt intimidated by her husband, she 
 
tried  to  keep  up  a  normal  façade  for  the  sake  of  the  children.    According  to  her 
account  she  talked  of  extreme  financial  difficulties  and  gaining  employment  at  a 
massage  parlour  to  alleviate  them.    In  order  to  deal  with  Mr  Quinn’s  contentions 
 
about the absurdity of accepting the “massage parlour” explanation she gave to the 
 
police,  we  must  note  that  she  told  the  writer  of  the  report  that  her  husband  had 
“initially agreed to transport her to the employment; however the nature of the work 
caused  immense  difficulties  between  the  couple  …  her  husband’s  attitude  to  her 
worsened and at every opportunity he degraded and tormented her in relation to the 
 
employment she had undertaken.  He had also, against her will, informed her parents 
 
of the work she had ventured in to.  … she left the employment after 2 days work.” 
  
Although she wished to escape from the marriage, she felt compelled to stay due to 
threats by him to harm himself if she left, the emotional strain and lack of finances 
and isolation. 

The appellant’s explanation for the retraction of the allegation of rape was that after 
 
her  husband  had  been  arrested  and  remanded  in  custody  she  felt  “immense  guilt”. 
 
She decided that taking divorce proceedings would be “punishment enough for him” 
 
and so she withdrew the complaint.  She was in an emotional state and very confused 
at  the  time.    Although  she  had  suffered  years  of  abuse  by  her  husband  and  was 
 
frightened of him she reported that “due to her feelings of guilt, low self esteem and 
wanting her children to have a family Christmas, she continued communicating with 
him”.    She  felt  under  “immense  pressure”  from  her  husband  to  retract  her  original 
statement and she had agreed to do so “due to fear of repercussions from him”.  The 
 
reasons for the retraction were developed later in the report.  The decision arose from 
“immense  pressure”  placed  upon  her  by  her  husband.    She  also  “felt  the  children 
should have regular contact with their father especially at Christmas”.  This coupled 
with  financial  difficulties,  lack  of  family  support  and  isolation  appeared  to  have 
contributed  to  “the  retraction  of  the  complaint”.    She  decided  to  lie  to  the  police 
“without thinking of the consequences”. 

This unprompted contemporaneous account by the appellant to the writer of the Pre-
Sentence  Report  about  the  circumstances  in  which  she  came  to  make  the  false 
retractions  of  which  she  was  subsequently  convicted  are,  again,  inconsistent  with  a 
defence of duress.

On  5th  November  at  Mold  Crown  Court  the  Pre-sentence  Report  and  careful 
 
submissions  on  behalf  of  the  appellant  by  Mr  Hennell  were  considered  before  the 
appellant was sentenced to an immediate prison sentence. 

 
In the context of the submission that the appellant was acting under duress when she 
retracted her allegations against her husband it is perhaps worth underlining what she 
 
herself has said in her recent sworn statement prepared for the purposes of the present 
appeal. 

 
52.	 

She reflected on the period between her husband’s release from prison on bail and her 
first lie to the police that 
 

“Sometimes he would be so upset that he appeared to be having 
a nervous breakdown.  Thinking of it now it was all a bit over 
the top, but at the time it made me feel all the more sorry for 
him.  Although he had done what he had done to me, by this 
time I was feeling responsible for all the upset and worries that 
he had about missing his children and being frightened of going 
to prison.  The children were upset because they couldn’t see 
their father and it was basically all my fault”. 

 
53.	 

Later she said  

“… 
I  had  tried  to  withdraw  the  complaint  but  that  the 
Prosecution wouldn’t drop the case.  Tracey (her sister-in-law) 
 
asked quite calmly what would happen to me if I told the police 
it was all a pack of lies.  I told her I wouldn’t do it because it 
would mean me going to prison and leaving my children, but 
Tracey  said  they  wouldn’t  put  me  in  prison  because  I  had  4 
children …  She was present when I made the telephone call to 
(the police)” 

 
54.	 

Later still, referring to events on 11th February, she said: 

“I  can  only  say  that  when  I  was  in  that  mental  state  I  didn’t 
think about what would happen to me but only if the case didn’t 
proceed  Terry  wouldn’t  have  to  be  in  prison,  my  children 
would have their father back and I would have some help”. 

 
55.	 

She had said earlier that when he was away she had “simply felt lost without him”. 
She went on: 

 

“All I can say now is that I would have said anything at that 
time to make it all go away.  I know it makes me sound quite 
calculating but I was really saying whatever I could to produce 
the result I wanted”. 

Miss Levitt suggested that on the appellant’s own present account, plainly she was 
under pressure, but the pressures were far removed from constituent elements of the 
defence of duress.  We agree.

As we have noted, we were pressed with the contents of the appellant’s evidence in 
the non-molestation proceedings at Welshpool County Court.  We shall simply record 
that in answer to her application, her husband produced a letter which he says was 
received by him while he was in custody, and therefore written before 12th February, 
in which the appellant wrote to him: 
 

“I have done the one thing that you said not to do.  I told you I 
would make it all go away and I will by doing what you said 
 
not to do.  I want you home babe, we all miss you so much.  I 
 
cry every night and every morning coz your not here”. 

The letter continues in affectionate terms. 

57.	  We can now turn from the lengthy summary of the facts to the submissions advanced 

 

in support of the conclusion that the conviction is unsafe. 

Discussion 

The offence 
 

Perverting the course of public justice 

 
58.	 

Before the hearing of the appeal we invited submissions from both sides on the broad 
question  whether  the  retraction  of  a  true  complaint  could  constitute  the  offence  of 
 
perverting  the  course  of  justice.    It  was  agreed  that  given  proof  of  the  necessary 
intention and the ingredients of the offence governed by the long standing decision in 
 
R v Vreones [1891] 1 QB 360 such conduct could indeed fall within the ambit of the 
 
offence.  The  conduct  alleged  and  admitted went  very  much  further  than  a  witness 
withdrawing a complaint or withholding evidence of rape. Rather it involved repeated 
assertions which led directly to the acquittal of the man who had committed rape on 
more  than  one  occasion.    It  was  not  suggested,  and  we  can  see  no  reason  for 
concluding that in the context of the ingredients of this offence, the victim of a crime 
is entitled to be treated differently from any other witness to a serious offence who 
falsely retracts truthful evidence.  In this context Miss Levitt emphasised that the issue 
was  the  defendant’s  intention,  not  her  motive,  and  that  if  the  necessary  intent  was 
 
present the defendant’s motivation, particularly if she was a victim of the crime, was 
relevant and should be taken into account when the court was considering sentence, 
assuming that in the light of current CPS policy she was prosecuted at all. 

 

 
59.	 

In our judgment, it is plain that this conviction cannot be quashed on the basis that the 
appellant’s  conduct  did  not  fall  within  the  ambit  of  the  offence  of  perverting  the 
 
course of public justice. 

The defence 

Duress 

On  the  facts  here  the  appellant  had  a  complete  defence  to  the  charge  based  on  the 
 
allegation  that  she  had  made  a  false  complaint  of  rape  against  her  husband.    That 
defence was that the complaint was true.  Mr Quinn submitted that it has now become 
 
apparent, and if the issue had been properly addressed before the appellant pleaded 
guilty,  it  would  then  have  been  apparent,  that  she  also  had  a  viable  defence  to  the

--------

A -v- R 

second  indictment  in  the  form  of  “duress”,  and  that  she  should  have  been  advised 
accordingly. 
 

 

61.	  Mr Quinn’s argument took as its starting point the observations in this court, when 
 
dealing with the appeal against sentence, which had underlined the specific problems 
which faced an abused partner.  This was lent significant support, he submitted, by the 
vulnerability  of  the  appellant  as  now  revealed  by  the  post  conviction  psychiatric 
evidence  that  she  was  at  all  material  times  suffering  from  post  traumatic  stress 
 
disorder at all relevant times.  In this context care however is needed to avoid any 
juxtaposition between the former law of provocation in the context of section 3 of the 
Homicide Act 1957, which provided Mr Quinn with a number of authorities to which 
he  directed  our  attention,  and  the  now  seemingly  endless  debate  about  the  true 
constituents of the characteristics appropriate to a defendant advancing that defence, 
and the defence of duress. 

 
62.	 

Duress is subject to clear limitations, and the thrust of recent decisions in the House of 
Lords has been that these limitations should not be further eroded.  (See R v Hasan 
 
[2005] 2 AC 467).  Although not directly relevant to the outcome of this appeal, in the 
 
context of duress, the situation of women who have been subjected to domestic abuse 
and  are  coerced  into  committing  crimes  against  third  parties  has  been  valuably 
illuminated in the article by Janet Loveless, Domestic Violence, Coercion and Duress 
 
[2010] CLR 93, where the writer observes: 

 

“Leaving aside for the moment the contentious issue of whether 
 
an  abused  woman,  even  one  suffering  from  BWS,  remains  a 
 
reasonable  person  or  not,  the  problem  of  the  law  is  how  to 
translate  the  medical  language  of  “learned  helplessness, 
passivity and paralysis” into the legal discourse of duress.  It is 
not simply that there is automatic equivalence between “learned 
helplessness” and “overpowerment of will”; the two are not the 
same”. 

The writer analyses the decisions of this court in R v Emery [1992] 14 Cr. App. R(S) 
394 and Bowen [1996] 2 Cr. App R 157. She suggests that reference to characteristics 
such as post traumatic stress disorder or battered women syndrome “merely reinforces 
the inconsistency and reveals the incompleteness of the test which requires that the 
defendant shall have displayed “reasonable fortitude””. 

All these considerations acknowledged, the question nevertheless remains whether on 
the facts here, and making the most generous allowance for the appellant’s psychiatric 
condition,  duress  might  have  provided  a  realistic  potential  defence.    Miss  Levitt 
emphasised,  and  we  agree,  that  duress  should  not  and  cannot  be  confused  with 
pressure.  The circumstances in which different individuals are subject to pressures, or 
perceive that they are under pressure are virtually infinite.  Such pressures may indeed 
provide powerful mitigation, as this court recognised when dealing with the appeal 
against sentence.   Dealing with it very broadly, duress involves pressure which arises 
in  extreme  circumstances,  the  threat  of  death  or  serious  injury,  which  for  the 
avoidance of any misunderstanding, we have no doubt would also include rape, and 
which  cannot  reasonably  be  evaded.  (See,  for  example,  the  approval  of  Graham 
 
[1982] 74 Cr. App. R 235  in Howe  [1987] AC 417 in the House of Lords, and the 
 
restricted approach to this problem intimated in the House of Lords in Hasan, where

64.	 

Lord Bingham warned against drawing comparisons between the duress defence and 
any other defences which might widen the scope of duress.)   

The contemporaneous evidence available to the appellant’s legal advisers, once she 
 
had decided to tell the truth provided a great deal of mitigation, but no viable defence 
of duress.  That was not the case that she was advancing in her instructions to them, or 
 
for that matter in her accounts to the police, who were undoubtedly sympathetic to her 
situation, and did their best to dissuade her from withdrawing the allegation and then 
to find an explanation for her doing so.  She did not suggest to any of them that when 
she falsely retracted her truthful complaints she was acting under the threat of serious 
ill  treatment  or  violence  at  the  hands  of  her  husband  or  anyone  else.   The  police 
 
interview on 16th August is one of the crucial features of this case.  By now, it must be 
remembered, the appellant was asserting that her husband had raped her more than 
once, and had treated her with violence, and that she was confirming the truth of her 
allegations against him.  If she had been threatened by him with violence if she did 
not withdraw the complaint, as it seems to us, it is unconceivable that she would not 
have said so at the time.  If she was asserting that he forced a retraction by raping her 
 
or  threatening  to  rape  her,  there  was  no  reason  why  she  should  not  also  have 
explained her retraction of the rapes by reference to any such threats.   

 

65.	  We  have  recorded  and  shall  not  repeat  the  account  given  by  the  appellant  of  the 
history  of  her  marriage  narrated  to  the  writer  of  the  Pre-Sentence  Report,  prepared 
after she had already pleaded guilty, but before she was sentenced.  This account, too, 
was quite insufficient to justify an application by her legal advisors for the court to 
allow her to vacate her guilty plea. 

Even  her  most  recent  statement  does  not  suggest  that  she  was  threatened  with 
violence  during  this  period,  and  in  particular,  at  the  time  when  she  made  her  false 
retractions.  We  have  set  out  her  account  in  some  detail  in  paragraphs  51-55.    We 
immediately  recognise  that  the  appellant  felt  under  huge  pressure,  but  although 
feeling concerned for or even fearful of her husband, or a sense of guilt, or concern 
about what would happen to her children if her husband was in prison for 10 years or 
thereabouts,  taken  in  combination,  undoubtedly  creates  difficult  problems  and 
provides significant mitigation, does not constitute duress.  It is unnecessary for us to 
examine the further problem of the alternative ways in which the appellant might have 
sought  to  avoid  any  such  risk,  not  least,  the  favourable  attitude  of  the  police,  who 
undoubtedly were anxious to give her every possible assistance. 

The recent psychiatric report is based on an assessment made in December 2011 and 
January  2012.  We  have  studied  it  in  detail.    The  appellant’s  account  of  why  she 
retracted her allegations has developed.  Nevertheless, even on this basis, the duress 
 
defence was not realistically available to her.  According to the report she stated that 
at the time of retraction “she felt very guilty”. …  “she believed instigating divorce 
proceedings was punishment enough and so decided to withdraw her complaint”.  … 
“when Mr A had been released on bail he had contacted her”.  … “she was in a very 
 
emotional state and was confused at the time and she was fearful of him as a result of 
the years of abuse she had suffered”.  … “due to her feelings of guilt, low self-esteem 
and wanting her children to have a family Christmas, she continued communicating 
with  Mr  A.”  …  “she  had  been  under  immense  pressure  from  Mr  A  to  retract  her 
statement and due to her fear of repercussions from her husband she had agreed.”

The conclusions proceed on the basis of the appellant’s account to the writer that the 
retraction was made as a consequence of her husband’s “continued abusive behaviour 
towards her after the allegations were made”.  This, however, is inconsistent with any 
 
of the other accounts provided by the appellant.  She referred to the visit of his sister, 
stating that: 

“She became very upset and told Mr A’s sister that she couldn’t 
cope without Mr A and the family needed him back.  She states 
 
that at this point they planned to say the allegations were a lie.” 

 
69.	 

The report goes on to record that she said that 

“the reason she told police that the allegations were untrue is 
because of the immense feelings of guilt and worry and also the 
pressure from Mr A and what he would do to her if she did not 
sort the problem out.” 

 
70.	 

Notwithstanding Mr Quinn’s forceful and persuasive advocacy, we can see no basis 
for  concluding  that  the  appellant  felt  exposed  to  violence  or  the  threat  of  violence 
 
when  she  made  the  false  retractions  on  which  her  prosecution  was  founded.    The 
defence  of  duress  was  not  realistically  available,  and  faced  with  the  material  now 
available,  no  responsible  counsel  would  have  advised  her  that  the  case  should  be 
contested on this basis. 

The plea 

 
71.	 

It was suggested in written and brief oral submissions that the guilty plea tendered by 
the  appellant  was  an  equivocal  plea.    The  basis  for  this  assertion  was  duress.  No 
further basis for this argument appears.  There is nothing in the material available to 
us to which suggests that the plea was equivocal. 

The decision to prosecute 

This submission as developed, had a number of different facets, and we shall attempt 
to  summarise  the  most  significant  features.    It  is  suggested  that  a  combination  of 
errors before the appellant’s conviction was made by the police, the appellant’s legal 
 
advisors, the Crown Prosecution Service, and indeed the court.  Although the errors 
were not made maliciously, and indeed in his oral argument, Mr Quinn accepted that 
 
he  could  not  identify  any  specific  area  of  professional  incompetence,  he  submitted 
that the overall effect of the errors was that the appellant was prosecuted when, if they 
 
had not been made, the prosecution would not have proceeded. 

In the context of the prosecution which took place, dealing first with the police, we 
can find nothing for which the police should be criticised.  We have to be realistic. 
The allegation of rape depended on the appellant’s complaint.  Her husband resolutely 
denied the allegations.  The police were presented with a woman who they believed 
had been raped by her husband, but who was nevertheless determined to assert that 
the allegations against him were false.  They made every proper attempt to dissuade 
her  from  retracting  her  allegations,  without  success.    They  sought  to  find  an 
explanation,  examining  with  her  whether  she  had  been  forced  by  her  husband  to 
withdraw the allegations.  They could not do more to help her avoid the consequences

of  her  actions.  They  could  not  pressurise  her  into  re-writing  the  script  she  was 
determined to provide, and indeed it is not beyond the bounds of imagination that they 
would  have  been  criticised  for  being  over  forceful  and  lacking  in  sensitivity  to  the 
needs  of  a  victim  of  rape  who  no  longer  wished  to  proceed  with  the  allegations. 
  
Moreover  once  the  case  against  her  husband  had  been  wholly  undermined  by  the 
appellant’s  first  retraction  and  assertion  that  she  had  lied,  the  facts  which  might 
reasonably  undermine  her  credibility  would  have  been  disclosed  to  her  husband’s 
defence team.  There was no alternative.  In reality, he was only released from prison 
when his continuing detention in custody and his continued prosecution would have 
been unjustified.  There was no longer any realistic prospect of success.  At the same 
 
time, faced with a clear belief that the appellant was lying when she exonerated her 
husband of rape, the investigating officers were entitled to believe that he had escaped 
 
justice.  That is not an irrelevant consideration. So they went as far as they properly 
could  in  interview  in  an  endeavour  to  discover  whether  she  had  been  subjected  to 
 
threats.    Their  efforts  were,  because  of  the  position  taken  by  the  appellant, 
unsuccessful.  That does not found any justified criticism.   

 

74.	  We  turn  to  the  appellant’s  legal  representatives.    In  our  judgment  she  was  well 
represented.  The files show that both her solicitor and counsel were anxious that she 
should tell the truth.  Her position if convicted of making a false allegation of rape 
would certainly have been far more perilous than if she were convicted on the basis of 
 
the retraction of a true allegation.  The fact that she was immediately released from 
custody  on  her  appeal  against  sentence  amply  establishes  the  value  of  the  advice 
given by her legal advisors.  If she had been convicted of making a false allegation of 
rape, the custodial sentence would have been longer, and wholly unappealable.  

Specific criticism is directed at the failure by the legal advisors to seek a psychiatric 
report of the kind now available.  For this purpose, Mr Quinn would presumably wish 
us to proceed on the basis of the accounts given to Mr Hutchinson by the appellant, 
rather  than  her  accounts  to  the  police,  or  indeed  to  the  writer  of  the  Pre-Sentence 
Report, and indeed her own account in this appeal. The question of medical evidence 
was addressed by the solicitors.  They obtained the appellant’s medical records.  On 
examination they could find nothing in them to suggest that there was or could be a 
 
psychiatric defence, not least because on the accounts the appellant was giving to the 
police and on her instructions to them,  and her later account for the purposes of the 
Pre-Sentence  Report,  for  the  reasons  we  have  given,  no  such  defence  was  viable. 
 
Even now, as we have explained, the psychiatric evidence, properly examined, would 
not, in the light of the remaining evidence, provide a sustainable defence.  Although 
this criticism is directed at the process which culminated in the conviction, as for the 
possible mitigation the report might have provided, the court considering the appeal 
against sentence did not need to be informed by psychiatric evidence. 

 

Faced with these considerations, Mr Quinn submitted that if a psychiatric report of the 
kind now available had been presented to the Crown Prosecution Service it would, or 
 
might, have led the Crown to discontinue the proceedings in the light of the Code for 
Crown  Prosecutors  and  the  CPS  for  prosecuting  cases  of  domestic  violence.    The 
general Code, while asserting the continuing value of the prosecutorial discretion not 
to prosecute, starts on the basis that a prosecution will normally take place unless the 
factors in favour of allowing the matter to be dealt with by an out-of-court disposal, 
such as the defendant’s illness, outweigh the public interest.  In particular, however, 
 

 
75.	 

 
76.

77.	 

 
78.	 

the more serious the offence, the more likely that the public interest would require a 
prosecution.  The  Code  also  observes  that  although  public  interest  factors  in  an 
 
individual case may argue against a prosecution, the prosecutors nevertheless should 
reflect whether these factors should not be put before the court after conviction, as 
 
mitigation of sentence.  

In relation to domestic violence, the entire policy of the CPS acknowledges, as this 
court has, that many victims of domestic violence find it difficult to give evidence at 
court, and that they need practical and emotional support for this purpose.  Sometimes 
 
the  victim  withdraws  support  for  the  prosecution  and  no  longer  wishes  to  give 
evidence.  The policy requires all these matters to be addressed.  The focus, however, 
is  the  withdrawal  of  support  for  the  prosecution,  not  the  fabrication  of  false 
retractions.  That issue has been directly addressed as a result of the present case, but 
the new policy was directed to fill the gap in the existing CPS Guidance revealed by 
this case. 

 

As it seems to us, Mr Quinn’s submission overlooks the seriousness involved of the 
offence committed by the appellant.  If the allegation of rape was true,   the appellant 
had  deliberately  and  falsely  and  persistently  chosen  to  exonerate  the  man  who  had 
raped  her.  The  real  issue  for  the  Crown  Prosecution  Service  was  the  form  of 
perverting the course of justice which should be prosecuted, not whether there should 
have  been  any  prosecution  at  all.  In  fact,  Mr  Sherrard  on  her  behalf,  advanced  all 
relevant considerations arising from the police belief that she had been the victim of 
rape for consideration.  We very much doubt that disclosure of a psychiatric report in 
terms of the present report but approaching the appellant’s accounts of events on the 
basis of those she was advancing during 2010 would have induced or persuaded the 
 
CPS  to  discontinue  the  prosecution.  The  reality  is  that  such  a  report  would  have 
 
provided ample mitigation, (but for the reasons given in our judgment in the appeal 
against sentence, this was obvious). Given the way the investigation had developed 
throughout 2010 up to and including the interview on 31st August, many competent 
legal  advisors  would  have  seen  no  advantage  to  their  client  in  disclosing  it  to  the 
prosecution. 
In  any  event,  however,  the  report  was  not  obtained,  and  we  fully 
understand the reasons why it was not, and the reasons why, if it had been obtained, it 
would still not have been disclosed to the prosecution. 

 

79.	  Miss Levitt accepted that if the most recent CPS Guidance about the approach to be 
 
adopted  to  cases  where  truthful  allegations  are  retracted  by  the  victim  of  rape  or 
 
domestic violence had been in existence at the time when the appellant pleaded guilty, 
 
she would not have been prosecuted.  This Guidance followed the expression by the 
Director of Public Prosecutions of his view on this particular case.  Miss Levitt did 
 
not accept that there had been an abuse of process or, that if all the steps suggested by 
Mr Quinn had been taken, a stay of proceedings would have been ordered. 

 

80.	  We agree.  We have detected the development of what may, if not arrested at an early 
 
stage,  become  a  new  form  of  satellite  litigation,  in  which  the  exercise  of  the 
prosecutorial discretion is made subject to a judicial review or abuse of process/stay 
of proceedings argument in the Crown Court. 

As to judicial review, there can, we suggest, be very few occasions indeed when an 
 
application for permission by or on behalf of a defendant should not be refused at the 
outset on the basis that an alternative remedy is available in the Crown Court.  This is 

 

 
81.
--------

A -v- R 

 
the  appropriate  tribunal  for  dealing  with  these  questions  on  the  rare  occasions  on 
which they may arise.  Precisely the same considerations apply to a case involving 
summary trial. 

 
82.	 

This principle is well established.  In R v Director of Public Prosecutions, ex parte 
Kebilene [2000] 2 AC 326, the House of Lords allowed an appeal from the decision of 
the Divisional Court presided over by Lord Bingham CJ on the basis that the decision 
of  the  Director  of  Public  Prosecutions  to  consent  to  a  prosecution  was  correctly 
addressed in the Crown Court as part of the ordinary criminal process.  Lord Steyn, 
with whom Lord Slynn of Hadley and Lord Cooke of Thorndon agreed, observed: 

“…  I  would  rule  that  absent  dishonesty  or  mala  fides  or  an 
exceptional  circumstance  the  decision  …  to  consent  to  the 
prosecution of the applicants is not amenable to judicial review.  
Whilst  the  passing  of  the  Human  Rights  Act  marked  a  great 
advance for our criminal justice system it is in my view vitally 
 
important that, so far as the courts concerned, its application in 
our  law  should  take  place  in  an  orderly  manner  which 
recognises the desirability of all challenges taking place in the 
criminal trial or on appeal”. 

Lord Hobhouse was equally trenchant. 

“If the substance of what it is sought to review is the answer to 
some issue between the prosecution and defence arising during 
a trial on indictment, that issue may not be made the subject of 
judicial review proceedings.” 

R (E) v DPP [2012] 1 Cr. App. R 6 is for the reasons set out in paragraph [85] wholly 
exceptional: if E’s case had stood alone judicial review would not have provided an 
appropriate remedy. 

There is, however a much more fundamental issue involved than the correct form of 
 
process.  It is elementary, but it has become necessary to emphasise, that Guidance 
issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions does not and, as a matter of law cannot, 
create any immunity or defence.  The  guidance and any policy documents publicly 
reflect the considerations which, in an individual case of the kind under consideration, 
are  considered  to  be  relevant  to  the  exercise  of  the  prosecutorial  discretion  not  to 
bring  an  individual  case  to  trial  notwithstanding  admissible  evidence  which  would 
otherwise justify a prosecution.  If, however, this exercise has been conscientiously 
undertaken, the sole question for the court is whether the offence has been committed. 
It is not the function of the court to substitute its own view for that of the Crown about 
 
whether there should be a prosecution.  The well known general observations of Lord 
Salmon in DPP v Humphrys [1977] AC 1, at 46, apply here as in any other case of 
suggested abuse of process. 

 

“I  respectfully  agree  …  that  a  judge  has  not  and  should  not 
appear  to  have  any  responsibility  for  the  institution  of 
prosecutions,  nor  has  he  any  power  to  refuse  to  allow  a 
prosecution to proceed merely because he considers that, as a 
matter of policy, it ought not to have been brought.  It is only if

84.	 

 
85.	 

the prosecution amounts to an abuse of the process of the court 
and is oppressive and vexatious that the judge has the power to 
invervene.” 

The court is not powerless.  In an appropriate case an order for absolute or conditional 
discharge will convey its distinct message. 

Grounds  for  a  stay  on  the  basis  of  oppression  or  misconduct  are  exemplified  in  ex 
parte Bennett [2994] 1 AC 42, Mullen [2000] QB 520 and Early [2003] 1 Cr. App. R 
19.  Occasionally,  too,  the  exercise  of  this  jurisdiction  may  be  justified  in  a  case 
where  the  prosecution  constitutes  an  infringement  of  this  country’s  international 
obligations  (see,  for  example  Asfaw  [2008]  1  AC  1061  (where  the  international 
obligation was reflected in statute) and LM and Others [2010] EWCA Crim. 2327, 
(subject to the qualifications in paragraphs [13]. [19] and [21]).  In summary, when it 
 
is sought to advance an argument for a stay by reference to policy or guidance issued 
by the Director of Public Prosecutions, by way of emphasis it is worth repeating, first, 
that  the  decision  whether  to  prosecute  or  not  must  always  be  made  by  the  Crown 
Prosecution  Service  and  not  the  court.  The  court  does  not  make  prosecutorial 
 
decisions.  Second,  provided  there  is  evidence  from  which  the  jury  may  properly 
convict,  it  can  only  be  in  the  rarest  circumstances  that  the  prosecution  may  be 
 
required  to  justify  the  decision  to  prosecute.    Third,  the  decision  whether  or  not  to 
prosecute  in  most  cases  requires  a  judgment  to  be  made  about  a  multiplicity  of 
interlocking circumstances.  Therefore even if it can be shown that in one respect or 
 
another, part or parts of the relevant guidance or policy have not been adhered to, it 
does not follow that there was an abuse of process.  Indeed, it remains open to the 
 
prosecution  in  an  individual  case,  for  good  reason,  to  disapply  its  own  policy  or 
guidance. 

A further aspect of the trend currently under discussion is exemplified by Mr Quinn’s 
 
submissions in this appeal.  In essence, his argument is that if everyone involved in 
the  case  had  behaved  differently,  then  the  appellant  would  or  might  not  have  been 
prosecuted at all.  In short, in the present case, the overall effect if all those concerned, 
fulfilling their different responsibilities, had behaved differently would have been the 
discontinuance  of  the  prosecution.    However  the  unavoidable  reality  is  that  the 
 
discretion whether to prosecute or not is exercised, and can only be exercised by the 
CPS on the basis of the information available to it.  After conviction it is unrealistic 
 
for fresh legal advisors to attempt to reconstruct a different series of facts or events 
 
which might have led the CPS to reach a different decision, or on that basis, to require 
the CPS to re-examine what the decision might have been if a series of hypothetical 
but  different  facts  had  been  in  contemplation  at  the  time  when  the  decision  to 
prosecute was taken, or the defendant was convicted. 

 

86.	  Miss Levitt does not accept that any contravention of prosecutorial policy or guidance 
in existence at the time when the appellant was convicted has been established.  In 
short,  she  rejects  the  suggestion  that  there  was  some  unreasonable  disregard  for  or 
unjustified or inexplicable disapplication of existing prosecutorial policy.  We agree. 
  
A prosecution which did not constitute an abuse of process at the date of conviction 
cannot  acquire  that  characteristic,  on  the  basis  of  new  or  amended  prosecutorial 
guidance or policy subsequently issued.

87.	 

 
88.	 

In the end, the final submission comes to the proposition that it is somehow not fair 
for the appellant to remain convicted.   Basing herself on the observations of the DPP 
in the aftermath of the successful appeal against sentence, and the consequent issue of 
new or amended policy guidance for use in cases of this kind, Miss Levitt adopted a 
neutral approach to it. The problem can be readily understood.  The principles relating 
to  abuse  of  process  have  not  extended  to,  and  it  would  be  surprising  if  they  had 
extended to, enabling this court to quash a conviction on a broad, somewhat nebulous 
basis of unfairness where the conviction, following due process, is in every respect 
safe.  If so, it cannot be quashed. 

 

The reality of this case is that the appellant was undoubtedly guilty of a serious crime, 
from which police officers did all they reasonably could to dissuade her.  Compassion 
for her position, and indeed for any woman in the same or a similar position, should 
have  produced  a  non-custodial  sentence.  That  is  why  this  court  acted  speedily  to 
 
quash the custodial sentence and replace it with a community order which would offer 
practical  assistance  to  the  appellant  in  the  immediate  aftermath  of  her  release  from 
prison.  The  court  also  expressed  itself  in  clear  and  direct  language,  which  was 
 
immediately considered by the Director of Public Prosecutions, who has now issued 
fresh  guidance  about  how  cases  involving  false  retractions  of  true  allegations  by 
vulnerable  defendants  will  be  addressed  in  the  future.    All  that  acknowledged,  we 
cannot  dispense  with  or  suspend  the  statute,  or  grant  ourselves  an  extra  statutory 
jurisdiction.  Accordingly, we are not entitled to interfere with this conviction.  The 
appeal must be dismissed.",2012-03-13 00:00:00,UK Court of Appeal

The Court of Appeal (Lord Chief Justice, Mr Justice Silber and Mr Justice Maddison) has today 
 
dismissed the appeal of a woman against her conviction for perverting the course of justice after she 
 
pleaded guilty to making a false retraction of a rape allegation. 
   
  
Background: 
 
  
The facts to this case is set out in paragraphs 1 ‐ 57. 
 
  
This appeal against conviction follows the woman's guilty plea at Mold Crown Court on 15 October 2010. 
 
That court sentenced her to eight months imprisonment on 5 November 2010. An earlier appeal against 
 
sentence was heard by the Court of Appeal on 23 November 2010 and the Court quashed the sentence and 
 
 
imposed a non‐custodial sentence. The woman, having changed legal team, later lodged an appeal against 
 
her conviction. 
 
  
On 28 November 2009 the appellant reported she'd been raped by her husband on 3 occasions. (para 10) 
 
  
On 21st December it was reported that the appellant wished to withdraw her allegation of rape against her 
 
husband.  The police contacted Victim Support Service to establish whether any problems had been 
 
reported to them.  The investigating officer was told that none had been mentioned.  During the Christmas 
 
period there was something of a reconciliation. Sexual intercourse took place between the husband and 
 
wife.  This was not rape, nor even reluctant acquiescence, but consensual sexual intercourse.  It happened 
 
because, in her reported words, she “wanted” to. Throughout this period she must have been aware that 
 
her husband was in breach of the bail condition that he should have no communication or contact with 
 
 
her.  The only realistic conclusion is that she connived at it.  She now finds it difficult to explain her 
 
behaviour at this time.  It does however provide the contextual background to the submission by Mr Quinn 
 
that there was a viable defence of duress open to the appellant. (para 14) 
 
  
On 7 January 2010, the appellant contacted the police to withdraw her complaint. (para 15) 
 
  
On 14 January, the appellant admitted that she had had consensual sexual intercourse with her husband 
 
over the Christmas period and pleaded with the police not to arrest him. (para 16) 
 
  
On 23 January, the appellant made a series of false complaints against her husband to 'spite him'. (para 17) 
 
  
On 7 February, the appellant made her first false retraction. (para 19) 
 
  
On 11 February, the appellant insisted to police that the allegations of rape were false. (para 21)

On 12 February, the Crown offered no evidence against her husband when he appeared at Mold Crown 
 
 
Court. (para 23) 
 
  
On 16 April, the appellant was arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice. She said in 
 
categoric terms that she was never raped by her husband. (paras 24 and 25) 
 
  
On 23 June, she was charged with perverting the course of justice on the basis of her false allegation 
 
against her husband. (para 26) 
 
  
On 30 July, the appellant met counsel for the first time and he advised her to 'stick with the truth'. (para

On 5 August, the appellant contacted the police and said she had been raped. Her reasons for retracting 
 
the allegation is set out in paragraph 31.

his solicitor had said more or less, he’s get about 10 years, and serve half.  Then we discussed 
 
about me ringing up and saying that I was lying and like he’d said and Tracey said as well, 
 
that it would be a suspended sentence for just like 2 or 3 months.  And then me sitting there 
 
stupidly thinking right, what’s best for the kids, Daddy missing for 5 years or Mummy missing 
 
for 3 months and that’s where them, yeh, …”.

On 16 September, the appellant was charged with an additional offence of perverting the course of justice 
 
by falsely retracting a true allegation of rape. (para 41) 
 
  
On 15 October, she pleaded guilty to the second charge. (para 42) 
 
  
According to the Pre‐Sentence Report of 4 November, the appellant’s explanation for the retraction of the 
 
allegation of rape was that after her husband had been arrested and remanded in custody she felt 
 
“immense guilt”.  She decided that taking divorce proceedings would be “punishment enough for him” and 
 
 
so she withdrew the complaint. (para 47 ‐ 48) 
 
  
Further explanation for her withdrawing her allegation is set out in paragraphs 51 ‐ 56. 
 
  
The Offence ‐ perverting the course of public justice: 
 
  
This is discussed in detail in paragraphs 58 ‐ 59.

Lord Judge, on behalf of the Court concluded: ""In our judgment, it is plain that this conviction cannot be 
 
quashed on the basis that the appellant’s conduct did not fall within the ambit of the offence of 
 
perverting the course of public justice."" (para 59) 
 
  
The Defence ‐ Duress: 
 
  
This is discussed in detail in paragraphs 60 ‐ 70. 
 
  
Lord Judge, on behalf of the Court, said: 
 
 
“The contemporaneous evidence available to the appellant’s legal advisers, once she had decided to tell 
 
the truth provided a great deal of mitigation, but no viable defence of duress.  That was not the case that 
 
she was advancing in her instructions to them, or for that matter in her accounts to the police, who were 
 
undoubtedly  sympathetic  to  her  situation,  and  did  their  best  to  dissuade  her  from  withdrawing  the 
 
allegation and then to find an explanation for her doing so.  She did not suggest to any of them that when 
 
she falsely retracted her truthful complaints she was acting under the threat of serious ill treatment or 
 
violence at the hands of her husband or anyone else.  The police interview on 16th  August is one of the 
 
crucial  features  of  this  case.  By  now,  it  must  be  remembered,  the  appellant  was  asserting  that  her 
 
husband had raped her more than once, and had treated her with violence, and that she was confirming 
 
the truth of her allegations against him.  If she had been threatened by him with violence if she did not 
 
withdraw the complaint, as it seems to us, it is unconceivable that she would not have said so at the time. 
  
If she was asserting that  he forced a retraction by raping her or threatening  to rape her, there was no 
 
 
reason  why  she  should  not  also  have  explained  her  retraction  of  the  rapes  by  reference  to  any  such 
 
threats.”  (para 64) 
 
 
He added: 
 
 
“Even her most recent statement does not suggest that she was threatened with violence during this 
 
period, and in particular, at the time when she made her false retractions.” (para 66) 
 
   
Lord Judge concluded: ""... we can see no basis for concluding that the appellant felt exposed to violence 
 
or the threat of violence when she made the false retractions on which her prosecution was founded. 
  
The defence of duress was not realistically available, and faced with the material now available, no 
 
responsible counsel would have advised her that the case should be contested on this basis."" (para 70) 
 
  
The plea: 
 
  
The basis of the plea is discussed in detail in paragraph 71. The Court concluded that ""There is nothing in 
 
the material available to us to which suggests that the plea was equivocal."" 
 
  
The decision to prosecute: 
 
  
This is discussed in detail in paragraphs 72 ‐ 87. 
 
  
Counsel for the Crown ""accepted that if the most recent CPS Guidance about the approach to be adopted 
 
to cases where truthful allegations are retracted by the victim of rape or domestic violence had been in 
 
existence at the time when the appellant pleaded guilty, she would not have been prosecuted.  This 
 
Guidance followed the expression by the Director of Public Prosecutions of his view on this particular case. 
 
... [However, counsel] did not accept that there had been an abuse of process or, that if all the steps 
 
suggested by Mr Quinn had been taken, a stay of proceedings would have been ordered."" (para 79)

--------
Lord Judge, on behalf of the Court, agreed: 
 
  
""... We have detected the development of what may, if not arrested at an early stage, become a new form 
 
 
of satellite litigation, in which the exercise of the prosecutorial discretion is made subject to a judicial 
 
review or abuse of process/stay of proceedings argument in the Crown Court. 
 
  
""As to judicial review, there can, we suggest, be very few occasions indeed when an application for 
 
permission by or on behalf of a defendant should not be refused at the outset on the basis that an 
 
alternative remedy is available in the Crown Court.  This is the appropriate tribunal for dealing with these 
 
questions on the rare occasions on which they may arise.  Precisely the same considerations apply to a case 
 
involving summary trial."" (para 80  ‐ 81) 
 
  
He went on to say: 
 
  
""... It is elementary, but it has become necessary to emphasise, that Guidance issued by the Director of 
 
Public Prosecutions does not and, as a matter of law cannot, create any immunity or defence.  ... It is not 
 
the function of the court to substitute its own view for that of the Crown about whether there should be a 
 
 
prosecution."" (para 83) 
 
  
Lord Judge concluded: 
 
  
"" ... A prosecution which did not constitute an abuse of process at the date of conviction cannot acquire 
 
 
that characteristic, on the basis of new or amended prosecutorial guidance or policy subsequently 
 
issued."" (para 86) 
 
   
Conclusion: 
 
  
Lord Judge, on behalf of the Court, concluded: 
 
  
""The reality of this case is that the appellant was undoubtedly guilty of a serious crime, from which 
 
police officers did all they reasonably could to dissuade her.  Compassion for her position, and indeed for 
 
 
any woman in the same or a similar position, should have produced a non‐custodial sentence. That is 
 
why this court acted speedily to quash the custodial sentence and replace it with a community order 
 
which would offer practical assistance to the appellant in the immediate aftermath of her release from 
 
prison.  The court also expressed itself in clear and direct language, which was immediately considered 
 
by the Director of Public Prosecutions, who has now issued fresh guidance about how cases involving 
 
false retractions of true allegations by vulnerable defendants will be addressed in the future.  All that 
 
acknowledged, we cannot dispense with or suspend the statute, or grant ourselves an extra statutory 
 
jurisdiction.  Accordingly, we are not entitled to interfere with this conviction.  Accordingly the appeal 
 
must be dismissed.""

RICHARDS
 

 

First Group: OMOREGIE, NWOKEH and ODEGBUNE: 

 

On the 25th March 2010 at about 5.15 pm, during the evening rush hour, in the 

presence  and  sight  of  many  horrified  commuters,  Sofyen  Belamoudden,  a 
 

fifteen  year  old  boy,  was  attacked  in  the  ticket  hall  of  the  District  and  Circle 

Line  at  Victoria  Station  by  a  pack  of  teenagers.  The  attack  lasted  some  12 
 

seconds  and  was  captured  on  CCTV.  He  was  stabbed  with  knives,  battered 

with other weapons, kicked with shod feet. When those 12 seconds were over 

Sofyen was left fatally wounded – with no less than nine stab wounds to his 

body - as his attackers made their escape. Most of them ran to a bus stop in 
 

Buckingham Palace Road where they boarded a C10 bus. When police boarded 
 

the bus at the next bus stop they found, amongst other weapons and potential 

weapons,  two  particular  knives.  Both  had,  it  transpired,  been  used  to  stab 

Sofyen. One was in a bag that belonged to you, Christopher Omoregie and the 

other was wrapped in a newspaper that bore your fingerprints, Obi Nwokeh. 
 

Upon  the  basis  of  the  evidence  provided  by  the  CCTV  and  those  murder 

weapons you were both convicted by the jury in your joint trial of Murder. You 

denied your guilt at trial and continue to deny it to this day, according to your 

 

1
--------
pre-sentence  reports.  You  have  also  both  been  convicted  of  Conspiracy  to 

Cause Grievous Bodily Harm, the basis of which I will deal with in a moment. 

 

You Samson Odegbune, were tried by a second jury in a separate trial.  You, 

too,  were  convicted  of  the  murder  of  Sofyen,  although  you  took  no  physical 

part in that final attack upon him in the ticket hall.  You were also convicted of 

conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm. 

 

The dreadful events at Victoria Station on that afternoon had their roots in a 

confrontation that had taken place the previous afternoon at the same station, 
 

beginning in the food court on the 2nd floor where many young people used to 
 

gather  on  their  way  home  from  their  schools  and  colleges.  You  were  all 

students  at  the  St  Charles  Sixth  Form  College  in  Ladbroke  Grove.  You  and 

many of your fellow students who were on their way to their homes in South 

London  used  to  travel  through  Victoria,  arriving  on  a  52  bus  and  going  on 
 

either by bus or by rail.  The other protagonists on that previous day were, it 
 

seems,  students  from  another  West  London  school  or  schools.  The 
 

disagreement  that  took  place  ended  with  one  of  your  number  receiving  a 
 

bloody nose at the hands of the opposition.  

 

That  night  and  the  following  morning there  was  communication  by  text  and 

by face book messages between members of your group amongst themselves 

and  with  members  of  the  opposing  group.  I  need  not  go  into  that 
 

communication  in  any  detail  save  to  say  that  you,  Odegbune,  played  a 

principal  role  in  it.  You  and  the  others  involved  expected  trouble  and  you 

made  it  clear  that  you  intended  to  come  to  college  the  next  day  armed  with 

your  samurai  sword.  The  result  was  that  the  St  Charles  students  plainly 

expected  that  there  was  going  to  be  serious  violence  the  following  day, 

probably,  as  you  then  believed,  in  the  vicinity  of  your  college  in  Ladbroke 

Grove.  You  expected  the  West  London  Boys  –  as  you  referred  to  them  –  to 

come  to  the  college  in  force  for  a  violent  confrontation.  Many  of  your  fellow 

students  came  to  college  on  that  day  with  a  variety  of  weapons.  You, 
 

Odegbune,  had  a  samurai  sword.  You,  Omoregie,  brought  to  college  2  chef’s 

steels. 

 

2
--------
The expected violence was, it appears from the evidence in the case, the talk of 

the  college  on  that  Thursday  morning  and  afternoon.  As  it  happened,  no 

opposing  group  came  to  the  college,  and  consequently  you  all  expected  the 
 

confrontation  to  take  place  at  Victoria  Station  as  you  made  your  way  home 
 

after college. 

 

You all travelled to Victoria expecting and intending trouble and prepared for 

it.  You,  Odegbune,  had  your  sword.  You,  Omoregie  and  you,  Nwokeh,  were 
 

each  by  now  armed,  as  I  am  satisfied  you  were,  with  the  knives  later  to  be 

found on the C10 bus and already referred to. 

 

 
It was in this way that the conspiracy, the subject of count 1, came into being. 

You all arrived at Victoria and gathered on the corner of Buckingham Palace 

Road  by  the  Grosvenor  Hotel.  It  was  not  long  before  the  opposing  group 

 
arrived,  also  by  bus,  from  West  London.  They  made  their  presence  known,  

challenging your group from the other side of Terminus Place where the buses 

arrive and depart. 

 

 
You, Odegbune, led the charge that resulted. You had taken out your sword. 

 
You shouted “we’re going to fuck you up”.   Although, as I have acknowledged, 

you  were  not  part  of  the  group  that  attacked  and  killed  Sofyen,  you  were 

convicted of murder on the basis that you intended that, in the course of your 
 

attack  on  the  opposing  group,  someone  should  be  killed  or  caused  really 

serious bodily harm or you realised that such might be the consequence and 

nevertheless took part in the violence. 

 

The punishment for the offence of murder is fixed by law. You were all aged 

under the age of 18 at the date of the offence. You, Omoregie and Odegbune 

were  both  16  years  old  and  you,  Nwokeh,  were  17.  Consequently  you  fall  to 

have passed upon you for the offence of murder sentences of Detention at her 

Majesty’s  Pleasure,  and  those  are  the  sentences  that  I  pass  in  each  of  your 

cases. But I have to determine the minimum term that each of you must serve 
 

before you may be considered for release on licence by the Parole Board. It is 
 

 

3
--------
agreed that, because of your ages at the date of the offence, the starting point 

 
for  each  of  you  is  a  minimum  term  of  12  years.  That,  however,  is  just  the  

starting  point  and  there  are  a  number  of  factors  to  be  taken  into  account 

before I arrive at the minimum term to be served in each of your cases. 

 

 
You all have the mitigation of youth, although that factor is largely subsumed 

 
in the starting point. Nevertheless I bear the fact of your youth in mind in your 

favour.  So  far  as  an  intention  to  kill  is  concerned,  nobody  who  has  seen  the 

CCTV  of  the  killing  could  possibly  conclude,  bearing  in  mind  the  number  of 

 
weapons  at  the  scene  and  the  use  to  which  they  were  put  in  a  ferocious  and 

merciless attack upon the deceased, that there was any less than an intention 

 
to kill him. 

 

 
There are a number of factors which in my judgment aggravate the offence for 

which you have been convicted. 

 
(1)  There was a considerable degree of planning and premeditation; 

(2)  You  gathered  together  for  the  purpose  of  serious  mass  violence  in  a 

 
busy  public  place  at  the  height  of  the  rush  hour  when  you  must  have  

anticipated  many  innocent  members  of  the  public  would  be  going 

about their lawful business; 

(3)  You acted in a large group and the deceased was attacked by at least 8 

 

persons; 

 
 

 
 

(4)  You carried and used weapons as described above; 

(5)  None  of  you  has  shown  any  kind  of  remorse  nor  do  you  in  any  way 

acknowledge responsibility for your crime. 

 

Had you been 18 years or older at the time of the commission of the offence, 

 
you would have been liable for a starting point for your minimum term of 25 

years, due to the carrying of knives and other weapons. 

 

In fixing the minimum term I take into account your convictions on count 1 of 

the indictment for conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm. 

 

 

4
--------
I see no reason to deal with any of you differently to the others. You, Omoregie 

and Nwokeh, were principals in the attack upon the deceased. You, Odegbune, 

 
as I have already said, were a principal organiser of the dreadful events of that 

day. 

 

In each of your cases I take into account all that has been advanced on your 

behalves, and the positive aspects of your conduct while in custody. 

 

In each of your cases I set the minimum term for your sentences of detention 

at her Majesty’s pleasure at 18 years. 

 

So far as count 1 of the indictment is concerned, in view of the contents of your 

pre-sentence  reports,  I  do  not  invoke  the  dangerousness  provisions  which 

 
would  lead  to  an  indeterminate  sentence.  You  will  each  serve  concurrent 

sentences of 8 years detention in a young offender institution. 

 

You,  Omoregie,  will  received  credit  of  753  days  towards  your  sentence,  you, 

Nwokeh, 753 days, and you, Odegbune, 700 days. 

 

I make no orders for recovery of defence costs in any of your cases. 

 

You may all go with the dock officers. 

 

Second Group: ODERINWALE, ROBERTS and AKRA 

 

On the 25th March 2010 at about 5.15 pm, during the evening rush hour, in the 

presence  and  sight  of  many  horrified  commuters,  Sofyen  Belamoudden,  a 
 

fifteen  year  old  boy,  was  attacked  in  the  ticket  hall  of  the  District  and  Circle 

Line  at  Victoria  Station  by  a  pack  of  teenagers.  The  attack  lasted  some  12 
 

seconds  and  was  captured  on  CCTV.  He  was  stabbed  with  knives,  battered 

with other weapons, kicked with shod feet. When those 12 seconds were over 

Sofyen was left fatally wounded – with no less than nine stab wounds to his 

 
body - as his attackers made their escape. Most of them ran to a bus stop in 

 

5
--------
Buckingham Palace Road where they boarded a C10 bus. When police boarded 
 

the bus a number of weapons used in the attack were discovered and seized. 

 

You have all been convicted of the manslaughter of the deceased. Additionally, 

you  all  stand  convicted  on  count  1  of  the  indictment  of  conspiracy  to  cause 
 

grievous bodily harm. You, Roberts, and you, Akra, were present at the attack 

upon  Sofyen  in  the  ticket  hall  and  took  part  in  it.  You,  Roberts,  kicked  the  
 

deceased 3 times as he lay helpless upon the floor. No one who has seen the 
 

CCTV  images  of  the  scene  could  fail  to  be  horrified  by  the  ferocity  of  one  of 

kicks you delivered to the head of the deceased. It was as if you were kicking a 

rugby  football.  Your  actions  were  vicious  and  your  victim  defenceless.  You, 

 
Akra,  as  you  admit,  struck  the  deceased  upon  the  neck  with  a  chef’s  steel 

 
which it seems you had obtained from one of your co-defendants, Christopher 

 
Omoregie.  True  it  is,  as  has  been  urged  on  your  behalf,  that  you  spent  only 

part  of  the  short  but  dreadful  attack  in  the  ticket  hall  and  that  you  were  the 

 
first  to  leave  the  scene.  But  you  stand  convicted,  as  do  you  Roberts,  on  the 

 
basis that you knew that at least one of  your group was armed with a knife or 

 
other bladed weapon and that you foresaw that such weapon might be used to 

cause some harm, albeit less than grievous bodily harm. 

 

 
You, Oderinwale, acted as armourer and that is the basis upon which you were 

convicted  of  manslaughter.  You  were  not  present  at  the  scene  of  the  attack; 

you  had  run  on  with  others  across  Terminus  Place  as  I  shall  presently 

describe.  Nevertheless,  you  were  responsible  for  the  purchase  of  a  block  of 

 

kitchen knives from Argos in Shepherds Bush in the early afternoon of the day 

of  these  events;  some  of  those  knives  were  used  to  kill  Sofyen;  you  were 
 

convicted  on  the  basis  that  you  intentionally  purchased  or  assisted  in  the 

purchase,  or  distributed  or  assisted  in  the  distribution  of  those  knives 

realising  that  some  harm,  albeit  short  of  grievous  bodily  harm,  might  be 

caused to another by the use of those knives or any of them. 

 

The  dreadful  events  of  that  day  had  their  roots  in  an  altercation  on  the 

previous  day  at  Victoria  Station  in  the  course  of  which  one  of  your  fellow 

students,  Melvin  Mensah,  received  a  bloody  nose.  That  night  there  was 

 

6
--------
considerable  text  and  facebook  communication  between  some  students  at 

 
your  college  and  also  with  members  of  what  I  will  call  the  opposing  group, 

 
referred  to  as  the  West  London  boys.  You,  Oderinwale,  were  amongst  those 

who took a principal part in those communications. You made reference to the 

fight that had taken place; you spoke of a “madness” that was planned to take 

 
place the following day between students from St Charles College and others; 

you  sought  a  “flick  out  ting”;  you  asked  for  someone  to  help  you  buy  some 

“nank”  (knives)  from  Argos,  giving  the  link  to  the  Argos  website.  When  you 

were asked by another if the “beef” was  “proper serious” you replied “if they 

see anyone they’re gonna get slumped” – in other words killed. You said that 

everyone  should  be  “tooled  up”.  In  that  way  you  helped  to  initiate  the 

conspiracy that was charged in count 1. 

 

 
Neither you, Akra, nor you, Roberts, can be said to have played any part in the 

conversations of that night. Nevertheless, it is clear from the evidence in the 

 
trial that the expected violent confrontation was the talk of the college on the 

following day and I have no doubt that you both travelled to Victoria on that 

 
afternoon expecting the sort of violent confrontation which in fact took place 

and prepared to play your part in it. 

 

Such  a  violent  confrontation  in  fact  took  place.  Your  group  gathered  in 

Terminus Place outside the Grosvenor Hotel. When challenged by members of 

 
the  opposing  group  you  all  joined  the  mass  charge  across  the  bus  lanes  of 

Terminus  Place.  You,  Oderinwale,  as  I  have  already  indicated,  ran  on, 

pursuing members of the opposing group. You, Akra and Roberts, joined the 

group  of  killers  who  set  upon  Sofyen  Belamoudden  as  he  lay  helpless  and 

defenceless  upon  the  floor  of  the  ticket  hall,  in  the  sight  of  those  many 

 
horrified  onlookers  who  had  been  going  about  their  lawful  business  at  the 

height, as I have said, of the rush hour. 

 

 
I  take  into  account  in  all  of  your  cases  that  which  I  have  read  about  you  in 

your pre-sentence reports and in the testimonials provided on your behalves. I 

take into account the way you have conducted yourselves whilst in custody. I 

 
take  into  account  in  each  of  your  cases  your  youth  at  the  time  of  the 

 

7
--------
commission  of  these  offences.  You,  Oderinwale  and  you,  Akra,  were  16,  you 

Roberts were 17. 

 

In  view  of  what  I  have  heard  and  read,  I  do  not  feel  the  need  to  invoke  the 

dangerousness  provisions  which  would  lead  to  an  indeterminate  sentence  in 

any  of  your  cases.  I  will  pass  in  each  of  your  cases  determinate  sentences  of 

detention  in  a  Young  Offender  Institution.  You,  Oderinwale,  will  have  credit 

 
for  700  days  in  custody;  you,  Akra,  for  753  days  and  you,  Roberts,  for  753 

 
days. You will each serve half of your sentences before you may be considered 

for release upon licence. 

 

The killing of Sofyen Belamoudden took place in dreadful circumstances in a 

public place as I have already described. You all played your parts in his death 

as set out above and stand convicted of his manslaughter. His death occurred 

following a conspiracy to which you were all parties. You, Oderinwale, were an 

early member of the conspiracy. You, Akra and you, Roberts, probably joined 

it later. 

 

On count 2 of this indictment there is no need to distinguish between you. You 

 
will  each  serve  12  years  in  a  young  offender  institution.  On  count  1  you, 

Oderinwale will serve 8 years in a young offender institution concurrent with 

your sentence on count 2 and you, Akra and you, Roberts, will serve 7 years in 
 

a young offender institution concurrent with your sentences on count 2. 

 

I make no orders for recovery of defence costs in any of your cases. 

 

You may go with the dock officers. 

 

Group 3: Enoch AMOAH and Tyrone RICHARDS 

 

You  have  each  been  convicted  of  count  1  on  this  indictment,  conspiracy  to 

cause grievous bodily harm, and on count 3, violent disorder. You were both 

acquitted  of  any  criminal  complicity  in  the  death  of  Sofyen  Belamoudden.  I 
 

 

8
--------
say  that  immediately  so  that  it  may  be  plainly  understood  that  I  put  that 

dreadful killing out of my mind in sentencing you for your offences. 

 

The  conspiracy  to  cause  grievous  bodily  harm  arose  from  events  on  the  24th 
 

March  2010  at  Victoria  Station  when,  in  a  confrontation  between  students 

from St Charles College, where you, Amoah, attended but you, Richards, did 

not,  and  other  youths,  known  collectively  as  the  West  London  boys,  a  St 

Charles student, Melvin Mensah, suffered a bloody nose. During the evening 

that followed, the conspiracy charged in count 1 came into existence. Trouble 

 
of a violent kind was expected the following day, at first outside the college in 

Ladbroke  Grove  but,  when  that  did  not  materialise,  at  Victoria  Station. 

Neither  of  you  appear  to  have  become  involved  in  the  conspiracy  until  the 

following day, the 25th March 2010. You, Amoah, travelled to Victoria on the 

52 bus from Ladbroke Grove with many of your fellow students, a number of 

 

whom were armed with knives or other weapons. It is not suggested that you 
 

yourself were armed. However, once at Victoria Station, you plainly joined the 

 

agreement hatched by others to cause grievous bodily harm to anyone of the 

opposing group who might be present there. You joined the charge across the 

bus  lanes  of  Terminus  Place.  You  were  parties,  as  your  convictions 

demonstrate,  to  at  least  the  threat  of  unlawful  violence.  A  large  number  of 

innocent  members  of  the  public  were  lawfully  going  about  their  business 

during the height of the rush hour. Not only evidence heard at trial but also 

CCTV  images  demonstrate  the  fear  in  which  you  and  your  co-defendants 

placed those people. 

 

You,  Amoah,  joined  your  college  contemporaries  in  the  unlawful  agreement 

charged  in  count  1.  You,  Richards,  came  to  be  there  because  of  your  close 

family  relationship  with  Samson  Odegbune  who  was  not  only  a  party  to  the 

conspiracy, but an instigator of it, as well as being responsible for the murder 

of a fifteen year old boy which took place during the violent disorder. I have no 
 

doubt  that  you  attended  the  scene  –  joining  the  52  bus  in  which  Odegbune 

was a passenger in Kensington as it made its way to Victoria – at the behest of 

your close relative. You were seen to join the eventual charge across Terminus 

Place with something in your hand. The prosecution claimed it was a knife or 
 

 

9
--------
other  bladed  article.  You  deny  that  it  was.  I  am  unable  safely  to  determine 

what you were carrying. But take part in the charge you undoubtedly did. 

 

In  each  of  your  cases  I  take  into  account  the  contents  of  your  pre-sentence 

reports.  I  find  no  need  in  either  of  your  cases  to  invoke  the  dangerousness  
 

provisions which would result in indeterminate sentences. I take into account 

in each of your cases your youth – you, Amoah were 17 at the time, you are 18 

now. You, Richards, were but 15 years old at the time, and are still under the 

age of 18. Your offence of conspiracy, Richards, I say at once, is too serious to 

 
justify the imposition of a detention and training order and so you will fall to 

be sentenced to a period of detention under section 91 of the Act of 2000.  

 

 
So far as you are concerned, Amoah, on count 1 of this indictment I impose a 

period of detention in a Young Offender Institution of 7 years with a period of 

3  years  concurrent  in  respect  of  count  3.  You  will  have  credit  for  566  days 

spent in custody. You will serve half of that sentence and may then be released 

on licence for the remainder. 

 

So far as you are concerned, Richards, I sentence you to a period of detention 

under  section  91  on  count  1  of  this  indictment  for  7  years,  of  which  you  will 

also serve half before release on licence, with 700 days credited for time spent 

 
in  custody.  In  view  of  my  limited  powers  because  of  your  age,  I  pass  no  

separate penalty on count 3, Violent Disorder. The sentence imposed on count 

1 is commensurate with the seriousness of both your offences. 

 

I make no order for defence costs in either of your cases. 

 

You may go with the dock officers.

BRISTOL CROWN COURT 

 

 

SENTENCING REMARKS OF MRS JUSTICE COX 

 

 

19 OCTOBER 2012 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Christopher Halliwell, the sentence for murder is life imprisonment and that is the 
sentence I impose upon you now. 
 
 
You are now aged 48.  You have pleaded guilty to the murder of Sian O’Callaghan, a 
much loved daughter, sister and partner – a happy, lively and caring young woman 
who enriched the lives of all those who knew her and who had everything to live for.  
In March 2011 she was just 22 years old. 
 
What exactly you did to her, and why you did it, may never be known.  On your behalf 
your counsel has today, on your instructions, offered for the first time an explanation 
as to how she met her death that night. I have considered it carefully and I have 
considered it against all the evidence which exists in this case.  Your account bears 
the hallmarks of an account carefully designed to try and explain away separate 
aspects of the evidence relied upon by the prosecution.  It is important however to 
view all that evidence cumulatively.  The CCTV, telephone and Automatic Number 
 
Plate Recognition evidence of your movements between 19 and 23 March, and 
forensic evidence as to Sian’s injuries, all provide cumulatively a compelling picture 
of events. 
 
I reject the account you have offered today.  I am satisfied so as to be sure on all the 
evidence of the following facts.  On Saturday 19 March, the night Sian was abducted, 
and I am sure that she was abducted, you were working in Swindon as a taxi driver.  
At 02.13 in the morning you turned your taxi handset off.  But you did not go home, 
as you told the taxi company you would.  CCTV shows your car driving around the 
area near the Suju nightclub in Swindon Old Town, circling round and round for 
some 40 minutes until you saw Sian.  She had spent the evening with friends, 
drinking and having fun at the Suju.  She left the club shortly before 3 a.m. to walk to 
her home, about 10 minutes walk away.  She was alone, she was intoxicated and she 
 
was walking unsteadily.  You saw her as you drove past, but you then stopped, turned 
round and drove back to her.   
 
You stopped and no doubt offered her, or persuaded her to have a taxi ride home, 
because she got into your taxi.  Poignantly, her partner had advised her never to walk 
 
home alone but to always use a taxi.  She probably had that advice in mind when she 

  

  

 

 

 

1
--------
got into your taxi, thinking that she would be safe; that it was the right thing to do. 
But she would soon have realised, with horror, that you were not taking her home, 
because you drove off in the opposite direction – out of Swindon towards 
Marlborough and the Savernake Forest - a distance it would have taken about half an 
hour to drive.  Having regard to all the evidence and in particular the telephone 
 
evidence relating to the location of Sian’s mobile  I reject the suggestion that you were 
initially told to drive to Covingham.  I am sure you knew exactly what you were doing 
when Sian got inside your taxi. 
 
You went home later that morning, but Sian did not.  You had assaulted her and 
 
murdered her and you had left her body somewhere in the Forest area.  I am entirely 
 
satisfied that you intended to kill her. 
 
The evidence shows that you drove back to the area where you’d left her at lunchtime 
on that same day – the 19 March.  You logged on for work again that evening but you 
deliberately turned your handset off again just before 7 p.m., no doubt to avoid your 
movements being traced.  In the three hours that followed, before you logged back 
on, you were driving around and looking for a remote area somewhere on the 
Berkshire Downs, where you could conceal her body. 
 
At some point on Monday 21 March you moved Sian’s body from the place you had 
first hidden her to the place on the Downs where she was eventually found by police 
on Thursday 24 March. 
 
On 22 March, while you were under surveillance, you were seen to be cleaning the 
rear seat of your taxi with cleaning fluid and then to be putting seat and headrest 
 
covers in an industrial wheelie bin, no doubt in an effort to remove any evidence that 
could link Sian’s murder to you.  Those items were found to have Sian’s blood upon 
them. 
 
On 23 March you drove back yet again to the place where Sian now was and later on 
you made further efforts to get rid of evidence by burning more car seat covers by the 
roadside nearby. You had displayed a police poster about Sian in your rear taxi 
window, again no doubt to give the impression that you were not linked to this crime. 
 
On 24 March Sian’s body was found, partially concealed amongst the undergrowth 
and positioned down a steep bank where she would not readily be seen.  She was 
lying face down and she was naked from the waist down to her ankles.  Her leggings 
 
and underwear were wrapped around her ankles and fabric from these items of 
clothing had been cut away in the crotch and buttock areas.  Her bra had been 
removed and a torn bra strap was found in the sleeve of her cardigan. 
 
 
The cause of Sian’s death was considered to be the combined effects of two stab 
wounds to her head and neck and compression of the neck.  You had stabbed her 
twice with a knife and there is little doubt that they were the fatal wounds.  You admit 
that you kept a knife in your car for self-protection.  There is evidence that it was a 6 
inch kitchen knife.  One of those stab wounds was so deep and penetrating that it 
passed right through her skull and would have required severe force.  Deep bruising 
and abrasions to her face were consistent with punches or kicks.  Deep bruising to her 
neck suggested pressure either from strangulation or, more likely, from blunt force 
 
trauma in an attempt to restrain her.  There were also bruises and abrasions to her 
breasts, particularly her left breast and nipple, caused possibly by biting. 
 
 
These, then, were the physical injuries you inflicted upon that young woman in what 
was clearly a savage and brutal attack.  The pain, terror, anguish and desperation she 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2
--------
would have suffered, as you assaulted and then murdered her, is truly horrifying to 
 
contemplate.  But her terror would have started long before then. She would have 
 
been terrified and panic-stricken right from the moment she realised that you were 
not going to drive her home.  She was terrified, helpless and alone. 
 
 
For this offence of murder I have to decide on the minimum term you must serve, as 
punishment, before the Parole Board can even consider your release on licence.  I do 
so having regard to the seriousness of the offence.  Your counsel has conceded that, 
 
since you had a knife with you in the taxi and you used it to stab Sian, the starting 
point is 25 years.  However, the Prosecution submit that this was a murder involving 
  
sexual conduct and that the starting point should therefore be 30 years. 
 
I am satisfied on the evidence, viewed cumulatively, that this was a murder involving 
sexual conduct.  I reject the submission by your counsel that I cannot be sure of that 
 
on the evidence in this case.  The Prosecution do not suggest that there is, here, any 
evidence of overt sexual activity.  Sexual conduct can, however, take many forms and 
again I view the evidence cumulatively.  After circling the area where you eventually 
 
saw Sian, you deliberately abducted this attractive young girl, who was alone late at 
night, and you drove her some distance away.  Her injuries included injuries to her 
 
left breast and nipple consistent with bites or another form of aggressive assault.  Her 
body was found half naked, with her leggings and underwear around her ankles. 
These factors, together with the cutting away of fabric from those items of clothing in 
the crotch area and the removal of her bra, point clearly to sexual conduct.  Had Sian 
survived, this evidence would have amounted to evidence of a sexual assault.   
 
The starting point in fixing the minimum term is therefore 30 years imprisonment. 
 
I make it plain that I shall ignore completely your previous convictions, which were 
many years ago now and were for offences of dishonesty.  You have no convictions for 
sexual or violent offences.   
 
There are a number of aggravating features in this case.  You abused your position as 
a taxi driver, in a car clearly marked as a taxi, and as someone Sian thought she could 
 
trust; her abduction was clearly premeditated; as a young woman walking alone late 
 
at night and under the influence of drink she was a vulnerable victim; there was here 
a prolonged period of time in which she would have suffered extreme fear and terror 
 
as well as severe pain from the injuries you inflicted upon her; and you made 
extensive efforts to conceal her body.   
 
There is little advanced by way of mitigation.  I accept, however, that your plea of 
guilty has avoided Sian’s family having to endure a trial, which is an important factor. 
 
Taking all the relevant factors into account and having careful regard to the overall 
 
seriousness of this offence the starting point will remain as 30 years. 
 
I shall allow a discount of five years for your plea of guilty, taking into account the 
 
legal advice you received, entirely properly, and the time that elapsed in this case as a 
result. There will also be deducted the period of 571 days, which you have already 
spent in custody.  That period will be deducted from the minimum term of 25 years, 
 
which is the term I consider properly reflects the seriousness of this case.  If you are 
eventually released on licence you will remain on licence for the rest of your life.

Sentencing Remarks 


Mr Justice Irwin 


 

Friday 16 November 2016 

 
 
 
Alesha Ahmed, yours is an extraordinary and terrifying story.  You were born in June 
1988, and so you were 15 years of age when your parents murdered your older sister 
Shafilea in front of your eyes.  She was then 17.  They suffocated her with a carrier bag in 
the family living room in Warrington, as you, your brother and your sisters watched.  Her 
body was disposed of in the Lake District, where it lay undiscovered for months.  You 
and your siblings were warned to keep silent.  You were told “we all know what happens 
to disobedient girls”. Your mother and father had justified what they had done, on the 
grounds that your sister Shafilea had western friends and wanted to live a western life, 
did not want an arranged marriage.  After the killing, your brother quickly told you and 
your sisters that Shafilea had deserved it.  I have read the remarks of Mr Justice Roderick 
Evans when passing sentence on your parents, after their conviction in August this year.  
He emphasised the impact on you, stating that your parents have blighted the lives of 
their surviving children.  He was just in making that remark.   
 
In late 2003 you were drawn into protecting them, making statements suggesting that 
Shafilea had left home alive.  However, shortly after your parents’ first arrest in 
December 2003, the conflict within you led you to tell a friend that your story of helping 
Shafilea to leave was a lie.  However at that stage you were unable to speak out in public 

 

1
--------
or to the authorities.  You were forced for years to carry this darkest of secrets, as your 
parents sought to evade justice. 
 
It is not surprising that relations with your parents were poor.  Such an event as this 
killing does not come unheralded, and this was a home where there had been consistent 
physical beatings.  The beatings were confined to the girls.  Your brother was spared. 
On your account, it was your mother, not your father, who was most angry and violent.  
The psychiatric evidence is that the unpredictable violence throughout your childhood, 
and the absence of ordinary parental protection, changed and distorted your personality 
even before your sister’s death. 
 
By the summer of 2010, you were 22 and a law student.  You had left home, and you 
were the subject of some hostility from your parents, and indeed your siblings.  Your 
sister Mevish had tried to break away, but as Mr Justice Roderick Evans put it, she “was 
recaptured and brought home and has since become compliant with your [parents’] 
wishes”, and she was hostile to you.  You have never been convicted of any offence but 
this, but you were clearly in difficulties.  You accumulated debt.   
 
On 25 August 2010 you brought men to the house for the purpose of robbery.  You 
acknowledge you knew that was the purpose. It is said that they exerted pressure over 
you to do so, and that seems likely to be true, although the court has heard no detail of 
how that arose. Early in the morning there was either an abandoned attempt or a 
reconnoitre, it is not clear which.  In the evening you let them in.  They brought weapons 
with them – a hand-gun, which was perhaps an imitation gun, a metal bar, and a 
hammer.  The Crown accept that you did not know they would come armed.  Your 
mother, brother and sisters were in the house, as you knew they would be, including your 
youngest sister who was then only 14.  Your father was absent.  A violent and terrifying 
robbery ensued.  Your brother and sisters had their wrists taped up and were forced to 
 
lie on the floor.  They were threatened in lurid and frightening terms, including threats to 
kill them. Your brother was kicked with a steel toe cap shoe. When your brother 
managed to loosen his bonds and tried to tackle the robbers, he was beaten.  Your sister 
was hit on the shoulder with the hammer.  It was fortunate that no-one suffered serious 
physical injury. 
 

 

2
--------
You actively helped the robbers.  Your wrists were never taped.  You told your family to 
do exactly what the robbers said.  You had a mobile phone, but of course did not call the 
police.  You had texted the robbers with instructions.  You told the robbers how to get 
to the money and the jewellery that was taken, which your parents claim was of 
considerable value – £10,000, and then  £30,000.  The police are sceptical of those 
claims. 
 
Not only did you help, but it was obvious that you were helping the perpetrators.  Your 
family quickly realised that.  When the robbers fled, you said you would leave but you did 
not do so.  You were initially restrained by family members, but then you simply stayed 
on the pavement outside the house until the police arrived.  One of the neighbours, a Mr 
Starkey, thought you looked very shocked.  Your family were very aggressive to you, 
accusing you, “venomous” as Mr Starkey put it.  Such was the atmosphere that, when PC 
Dadswell the first police officer came on the scene, his main concern was for your safety.  
That must have been in your mind too, because within moments you said to him “You 
know what happened to my sister?” 
 
The psychiatrist has considered your culpability in relation to the robbery, and the 
motivation for it.  He suggests that it took place in the context of “a very disturbed state 
of mind, marked by dissociation, suggestibility and a lack of real consideration of the 
consequences of your acts”.  In my view that chimes with the way you behaved on the 
day. 
 
After your arrest, you told your story to the police, quickly as to the death of your sister, 
but only later about the robbery.  You made full statements about the murder, giving 
great detail, which proved to be accurate.  You denied being a participant in the robbery 
 
until text messages retrieved made that untenable.  You then admitted what you had 
done, and you pleaded guilty to the robbery at the first opportunity.  The other robbers 
were never traced by the police. 
 
From soon after your arrest you were placed on the witness protection scheme, for your 
own safety, but in stringent and confined conditions.  You remained there for over two 
years. This can properly be compared to house arrest, and I accept it had an especially 
intense effect on you, since you were psychologically vulnerable, you were in a state of 

 

3
--------
conflict with your family, isolated and away from friends and any ordinary support.  In 
addition there was real concern for your safety, which must have added to your anxiety 
and depression. 
 
Your parents had been suspected of the murder from early on, and the finding of the 
Coroner as to your sister’s death was a verdict of unlawful killing.  However, in 2006 
Queen’s Counsel had advised that there was insufficient evidence available for a 
successful prosecution.  It was your co-operation which changed that.  You maintained 
that co-operation, as the investigation was revived, your parents were arrested and 
charged, and the case moved towards a trial.  You gave evidence at the trial for eight 
days.  It is accepted that your evidence was the crucial matter which allowed the case to 
be brought, and which opened the case up for the jury.  The content of your evidence 
was confirmed, when it was shown that your sister Mevish had given a similar account to 
a friend, although at the trial she denied it was the truth, claiming it was a fantasy.  It was 
your evidence which laid the foundation for the case, so that as the trial proceeded, your 
 
mother changed her story, and accused your father of the murder, whilst still attempting 
to exculpate herself.  Because of what you did, the truth has emerged.  The complex 
cases unit of the Crown Prosecution Service have struggled to identify any other case 
where the assistance of a witness has been as important as yours, or where the impact of 
 
the case on that witness has been as great.   
 
It is also significant that you were not trying to bargain for a lower sentence in giving 
your evidence.  Your initial request was to be sentenced before your parents’ trial, so that 
no-one could accuse you of seeking to profit from what you said about them.  
 
I have already touched on the effect of your upbringing.  I have seen a good deal of 
psychological and psychiatric material on you, prepared by experts for the Crown as well 
as instructed by the defence.  I bear in mind all of that. It is not necessary for me to 
quote technical medical language.  There have been really significant psychological 
difficulties for you as a result of all of this.  One of the experts is a specialist in caring for 
the victims of torture.  He has said that the psychological work he conducted with you 
during the murder trial was the most complex and harrowing of his professional career.  
 

 

4
--------
Robbery in the home is a very serious crime.  That is so here, even allowing for the fact 
that you did not know weapons would be used.  This was terrifying, and you must have 
realised it would be so.  There was violence, although no significant injury.  No-one had 
any active medical treatment as a result. The normal sentence for an offence of this kind, 
will be a significant period of imprisonment, even for someone of good character and for 
someone who pleaded guilty.  In all but the very rarest case, that will be right, whatever 
provocation might be present, and however strong the personal mitigation advanced.  
However, the Court of Appeal have stressed that there is a wide range of conduct in such 
cases, and that assessing the individual case is a matter for the judge who knows the 
detail. In this context I bear in mind that although your role in the robbery was crucial, 
there was a degree of unreality about how you behaved.  You were bound to be linked to 
this from the very start, and you made no attempt to leave or to avoid your arrest.  
 
The Crown have described this as a truly exceptional sentencing exercise.  Ms Forshall 
QC has urged on the court that this is a most exceptional case, and that it is possible to 
avoid an immediate sentence of imprisonment in your case.  I have read the pre-sentence 
report with care.  I bear in mind all of the extraordinary circumstances I have outlined, in 
particular the truly appalling nature of what you had to witness, the impact this has had 
on you, and what you went through to be a witness.  I bear in mind that, despite your 
undoubted intelligence and despite the help you may be given, your future life will be 
overshadowed by all that has happened, and it may be a long time before you achieve 
peace of mind and anything like normality.  In my view this is a case for mercy. 
 
The sentence of the court is one of 12 months imprisonment, suspended for a period of 
two years.  There will be a condition that during that period you are supervised by the 
probation service.  In fact they are likely to be of help to you.  You must co-operate with 
them and comply with their instructions.  There will be a further condition that you 
undergo continuing mental health treatment, with the psychologist, and with any 
psychiatric service which may be recommended. I am confident you will not re-offend. 
You may go.

For Mention 


 15 February 2012 


Ruling of Mr Justice Treacy
 
 

 

 

 
 

Central Criminal Court sitting at The Royal Courts of Justice  


1.  The case has been listed for mention today. It is to deal with a purely 
 
technical matter. There is no question of the sentences imposed on the 
Defendants  being  affected  in  any  way.  In  the  circumstances,  the 
Defendants have waived their right to attend. All parties, however, have 
attended by counsel. 

 
2.  The case has been listed as a result of a matter noticed in the Attorney 
General’s  Office  in  reviewing  the  sentences  and  concluding  that  they 
should not be referred to the Court of Appeal Criminal Division under 
 
s36 Criminal Justice Act 1988 (unduly lenient sentences).  

3.  At the sentencing hearing on 4th January 2012, all parties proceeded 
on the basis that Schedule 22 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 applied 
to a sentence of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure which is the 
 
appropriate form of life sentence in cases where an offender, who was 
under 18 at the time of the crime, is convicted of murder.  

4.  S277  of  the  Criminal  Justice  Act  2003  is  the  interpretation  section 
relating to Chapter 7 of the Act, including s276 which brings Schedule 
 
22  into  effect.  In  S277  “life  sentence”  is  defined  for  the  purposes  of 
 
Chapter  7  as  including  “(b)  a  sentence  of  detention  during  Her 
Majesty’s Pleasure”.  

5.  However, paragraph 1 of Schedule 22 also provides a definition of “life 
sentence”  for  the  purposes  of  Schedule  22  which  does  not  include  a 
sentence  of  detention  during  Her  Majesty’s  pleasure.  This  was 
 
overlooked by all concerned at the time of sentencing. 

6.  It  follows  that,  strictly  speaking,  Schedule  22  does  not  apply  in  this 
 
case.  All  parties  have  considered  the  point  and  agree  with  this 
 
conclusion. 

 
7.  However,  all  parties  agree  that  this  in  no  way  affects  the  sentences 
passed. It is expressly agreed on the part of the Defendants that the
--------
minimum terms imposed were lawful and that they were determined in 
accordance with appropriate principles. 

8.  Although  on  a  proper  construction  of  the  statute  and  the  schedule, 
 
Schedule 22 does not directly apply to this case, it does apply indirectly 
because the principle of non-retroactivity (in relation to Schedule 21), 
and  the  matters  identified  in  Lord  Woolf  CJ’s  Practice  Statement 
(Juveniles:  Murder  Tariff)  [2000]  1  WLR  1665  mandate  a  process 
which is effectively identical to that identified in Schedule 22.  

9.  Accordingly,  although  my  sentencing  remarks  on  4th  January  2012 
were  strictly  in  error  in  their  reference  at  paragraph  15  to  my  being 
“required”  to  pass  sentence  by  reference  to  Schedule  22  Paragraph 
10(a), exactly the same principles as are referred to there had to be, 
and were applied in this case. 

10.As  already  indicated,  all  parties  agree  that,  the  correct  principles 
 
having been applied, albeit with an inappropriate reference to Schedule 
22, there is no legal or factual basis upon which to reach any different 
length of minimum sentence from that which has already lawfully been 
imposed. 

11.There  is,  therefore,  no  step  that  it  is  necessary  for  this  court  to  take 

beyond clarifying the position in the terms of this ruling. 

12.I direct that this ruling be appended to the transcript of my sentencing 

remarks made on 4th January 2012.

SENTENCING REMARKS OF MR JUSTICE SAUNDERS
 

 

5 NOVEMBER 2012 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
On the verdict of the jury, this Defendant on 7 January 2004 at just after 8.15 in the 
evening  shot Col Workman dead on  his own doorstep with a sawn off shotgun. Col 
 
Workman was 83 when he was shot down. He was unarmed and in poor health. He 
had neither the capacity nor the opportunity to defend himself. He was living out a 
 
peaceful retirement in a cottage in a small village in rural Hertfordshire when his life 
was brutally cut short. It was a terrible crime and people living in that rural 
community were shocked by the gunning down in cold blood of one of their elderly 
neighbours. Such an event is bound to create feelings of fear among other residents 
which can continue for a long time.  I cannot say for certain what the reason for the 
 
attack was. Several have been suggested during the evidence but none has been 
proved to my satisfaction. Maybe we will never know. 
 
After this murder, sometime at the end of November or the beginning of December 
2004, the Defendant shot dead Fred Moss. So he gunned down and killed two people 
 
in a period of less than 12 months. He was convicted of that murder on 27 February 
 
2006 and was sentenced to Life Imprisonment with a minimum time to serve of 30 
years. The body of Fred Moss has never been recovered and no one witnessed him 
being shot, but the trial Judge found as a fact that the Defendant had killed Moss by 
 
shooting him and that was the basis on which the Defendant was sentenced. I am 
satisfied so that I am sure in the light of the verdicts that these killings were 
 
connected. The Defendant could in law have been tried for both murders together 
and the fact that he wasn’t is not his fault; it arises from the way the investigation 
proceeded. 
  
 
It goes without saying from what has been proved against the Defendant in two trials 
 
that he is an exceptionally dangerous man. 
  
The sentence that I have to impose is one of Life Imprisonment and he will not be 
released from that sentence unless and until the Parole Board are satisfied that he no 
longer represents a threat to others. Having been proved to have killed two people the 
 
Defendant may never be released. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1
--------
I do have to fix a minimum period that the Defendant must serve before his release 
 
on licence is even considered. That period is to reflect the seriousness of the offence. 
 
It does not take into account the danger that this man presents to the public as that is 
 
reflected in the Life sentence. 
 
I have to select from schedule 21 of the CJA 2003 an appropriate starting point. I will, 
as I have said, deal with the case as if the Defendant had been tried and convicted of 
both murders in the same trial. I cannot be sure that any of the matters specified in 
para 4 (2) have been proved. While the fact that a gun was used on both occasions 
 
indicates a degree of planning, I cannot be sure that it was substantial. I take as my 
 
starting point 30 years. Because any sentence of life imprisonment has to be served 
 
concurrently with any existing sentence, I have to take into account both murders in 
fixing the minimum period. There are a number of matters which cause the minimum 
sentence to be increased. There are two separate features which result in a starting 
point of 30 years: the use of a firearm in each case and the fact of two murders. The 
victim was vulnerable by reason of his age and ill health. None of the mitigating 
 
factors apply. The Defendant clearly intended to kill in my judgement. 
The only factor that I take into account in mitigating the length of the minimum 
period is that the period should not be so long as to prevent the Parole Board 
releasing the Defendant when he is old and is no longer capable of being a threat to 
anyone.  
 
 
Had I been sentencing you for both killings at the same time I would have ordered 
that you should serve a minimum period of 40 years and that is in effect the 
minimum term that I order you to serve. As you have already served very nearly 8 
years I direct that the minimum period that you should serve is 32 years from today. 
None of the time that you have spent in custody to date will count towards that 
 
sentence. It should be borne in mind by everyone who considers this sentence, that 
 
that does not mean that you will be released at the end of that period. You may very 
well not be.

Decision on the application to exclude identification evidence 

 
 

 
History 

1.  I delivered an abbreviated version of this decision orally in open court 
for the benefit of the prosecution, the defendants and the public. This 
manuscript version is the authoritative version.  
 

2.  For a summary of the evidence available to the Crown in support of 
this case, I refer back to my Decision on the applications to dismiss, 
dated 29 June 2012 (handed down in writing).  

 
3.  On 2 June 2011, Inspector Dallimore held a video identification parade 

at Lewisham Police Station in which two suspects, the 
“indistinguishable” identical twins Lee and Leon Russell (as Mr 
Dallimore described them during the voir dire on 5 October 2012), were 
placed on the same “line‐up” relating to an incident that occurred five 
years earlier, namely at 6.00 am on 7 March 2006. The witness, Kieran 
Jackson, was asked if he could identify the taller of two men who
--------
forced their way into his flat when he was shot along with his brother 
Jordan and Leyla Djemal‐Northcott. Jordan and Leyla were killed, 
whilst Kieran survived despite being hit by bullets several times, fired 
at close range. It follows that the prosecution suggested only one of the 
Russell brothers was in the flat at the relevant time, and therefore a 
choice needed to be made between them. Mr Dallimore accepted that 
the prosecution needed to ensure that Kieran Jackson could tell the two 
brothers apart – that, he said, was an objective of the parade. The taller 
man had been wearing a balaclava or similar piece of clothing which 
covered his face, save for the eyes and the skin of the face immediately 
surrounding them.  

 
4.  The film prepared for the identification parade seemingly contained 14 

people. In fact, there was a single photograph of each of the two 
brothers along with six other people (the latter having been 
photographed twice, in slightly different poses, presumably in an 
attempt to mimic identical twins). All of the photographs had been 
taken when the individual concerned came into custody.  The 
participants were variously arranged on a choice of four parades, with 
the Russell brothers appearing as follows:  

1st. Lee Russell at number 3 and Leon Russell at number 8.  
2nd Lee Russell at number 11 and Leon Russell at number 4.  
3rd Lee Russell at number 12 and Leon Russell at number 7. 
4th Lee Russell at number 5 and Leon Russell at number 9.  

5.  No objections were taken as to the arrangements for the parade (in 

advance, on 8 April 2011, by Mr Ismail and on the day of the parade, 
by Jack O’Keefe, both from Dexter Henry & Co). On 2 June 2011 Leon 
Russell’s representative was given the choice of which of the versions 
was to be shown to Kieran Jackson and he selected the second, as 
indicated above.  

 
6.  Having twice seen the members of the line‐up brought up on the 

screen one by one, Kieran Jackson asked – in the following order – to 
see: 

‐ 

four times, all the images together; then number 4 (Leon Russell); 
 

‐  all of them together; 

‐  number 4 (Leon);
--------
‐  number 8;  

‐  number 11 (Lee); and  

‐  number 13.   

7.  Thereafter, following a period of reflection but without qualification, 

he identified number 4 (Leon Russell).  

8.  He said he had not seen any image, nor had he been provided with a 

description, of the suspect in advance of the identification parade. 

9.  In the dismissal decision, I dealt with the identification issues – as they 

were then presented – as follows: 

12. […] three men who broadly (although not necessarily always exactly) 
match Leon Russell, Shaun Sutton and Lee Russell were seen at the block of 
flats shortly before the murders and attempted murder and they left quickly 
after the shots were fired. However, central to the prosecution case on this 
application is the identification by Kieran Jackson of Leon Russell (whom he 
did not know before the shooting) as the taller gunman, during an 
identification procedure on 2 June 2011. The prosecution concedes that if I 
conclude that this identification procedure could not be relied on by the jury, 
having received proper directions, the four dismissal applications would 
inevitably succeed.  The Crown aver that this critical piece of evidence links 
all the accused, along with the remainder of the evidence, with the three 
offences.  Issue is taken by Ms Khan Q.C., supported by counsel for the other 
accused, as to the reliability and probative value of this identification, which 
undoubtedly has some markedly distinctive features. The offence occurred 
on 7 March 2006 but Kieran Jackson did not make the identification until 2 
June 2011. The man he identified had been wearing a balaclava or some other 
piece of clothing or material which left only the area around his eyes visible. 
Lee and Leon Russell are identical twins and both of their photographs were 
included in the ʺline upʺ. It is accepted that Annex A (a)(2) of Code D of the 
PACE, which addresses the situation when two suspects of very similar 
appearance need to participate in a procedure, was properly applied. 

 

13. As it seems to me, notwithstanding the limited area of the face of the 
gunman that was exposed, a jury would be entitled to conclude that during 
the intense moments before the shots were fired, Kieran Jackson had every 
reason to study and recall those parts of his face which were visible. He took 
great care during the identification procedure, asking to see selected images 
and narrowing them down until he finally chose Leon Russell (a man he had 
not seen before) as the taller gunman. I entirely accept that the jury will need 
the most careful directions as to all the elements surrounding this evidence, 
and particularly the features I have summarised above, but this is an issue for 
the jury and I would be usurping their role if I purported to conclude that it 
is not open to them to decide that Kieran Jackson correctly identified Leon
--------
Russell from his overall appearance, and particularly around the upper part 
of his face, 5 years after the event. It is for a jury and not the judge to assess 
whether the matters summarised by Ms Khan render this evidence 
insufficiently reliable. There is no rule of law – or, for that matter, common 
sense – that determines the precise extent of a human face that must be 
revealed before a witness can make a safe identification; nor is there a legal 
principle that a witness can never safely distinguish between twins. These are 
usually matters for juries to resolve.  

 

14. In reaching this conclusion I have taken into account all the matters urged 
by Ms Khan, and including the period Kieran Jackson spent on the floor, the 
lack of any identification of Shaun Sutton and the smoke in the room after the 
gunshots. 

 
Submissions 

10. There are essentially five strands to the argument that Miss Khan QC 
has deployed in support of this application on behalf of Leon Russell.  

 

I. The Russell brothers are identical 

11.  The Crown does not dispute the defence assertion that the brothers are 

so‐called identical twins, and it has not advanced any particular 
aspects of their appearance that would have enabled the witness to 
distinguish between them, particularly given he could only see the 
perpetrator’s eyes and the skin immediately surrounding them. Ms 
Khan’s submission was that Leon and Lee Russell “are, to all intents and 
purposes, indistinguishable, particularly to those who are not close friends or 
family members. The impossibility of distinguishing between them is 
aggravated in the instant case when the witness’s ability to identify was based 
on the suspect’s eyes alone”. 

 

II. Breaches of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, Code D 
Annex A D: 

12. It is argued by Ms Khan that placing both Russell twins on the same 
identification parade and the use of only six other people constituted 
breaches of PACE: Code D Annex A D:2. The Code sets out the 
following: 

 

The set of images must include the suspect and at least eight other people 
who, so far as possible, resemble the suspect in age, general appearance and 
position in life. Only one suspect shall appear in any set unless there are two 
suspects of roughly similar appearance, in which case they may be shown 
together with at least twelve other people.  

 
13. It is submitted that the two brothers should not have been shown on 

the same identification parade because identical twins do not meet the 
requirements of “suspects of roughly similar appearance”. Instead, it is
--------
contended that there should have been separate parades, although it 
would have been permissible for the witness to see the two “line‐ups” 
at the same time.  
 

14. Moreover, it is said that “[t]he prejudice of including only six volunteers on 

the parade cannot be overstated. Examination of the pictures makes it clear 
that there are seven pairings, within each of which it is impossible to 
distinguish individuals. Thus, Kieran Jackson had a choice of seven sets of 
‘twins’ from whom to select. This greatly and unfairly increased the 
probability of the Russell twins, as a pair, being selected, as compared to the 
eight or twelve volunteers that the Code provides they should have been 
considered against (as individuals or as a pair, respectively). This is a 
significant and substantial breach, which, it is submitted, in and of itself, 
should give rise to exclusion of the identification evidence” [29]. 

15. The prosecution argues that it is permissible to place identical twins on 

the same parade, and it is suggested that there may not have been a 
breach of the Codes with regard to the number of volunteers who 
should make up a video identification. In any event it is argued that 
“[e]ven if there has been a technical breach, it was done to provide the suspects 
with greater rather than fewer safeguards against being selected by the witness 
in this unusual case and no unfairness resulted to Leon Russell such that the 
evidence ought to be excluded” [2 (b)].  
 
III. Breach of Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, Code D Annex A 

D:3 
16. Ms Khan suggests that the overall appearance of the Russell brothers in 

 

the two photographs of them was dissimilar, and particularly it is 
argued that the photograph of Lee Russell was very poorly lit, and it 
was more difficult to make out his features. The defence stresses “the 
outline of Lee’s eyes are not as clearly visible as those of his twin brother” 
[11]. It is noted that Lee Russell was “looking very far to his left” whilst 
Leon Russell’s eyes are “slightly averted from the camera” [31]. It is 
contended that “[t]he visibility of the eyes was of fundamental importance in 
this case, as the purported identification purports to be based upon a view of 
the eyes alone. In the photographs used in the procedure, Leon’s eyes are much 
more clearly visible”. 
 

17. The Code sets out the following: 
 

The images used to conduct a video identification shall, as far as possible, 
show the suspect and other people in the same positions or carrying out the 
same sequence of movements. They shall also show the suspect and other
--------
people under identical conditions unless the identification officer reasonably 
believes:  
 

a)  because of the suspect’s failure or refusal to co‐operate or other reasons, it is 

not practicable for the conditions to be identical; and 
 

b)  any difference in the conditions would not direct a witness’s attention to any 

 

 

 

individual image. 

18. On this basis it is argued by Ms Khan that “Annex A D.3 makes clear that 

the images used in the procedure must show suspects under ‘identical 
conditions’. The only exception to this is where a defendant is not cooperative, 
whereas Leon Russell fully cooperated with this procedure” [30]. 
 

19. The prosecution suggests “when looked at overall, the set of 14 images 
shown to the witness sufficiently resembled Leon Russell ‘in age, general 
appearance and position in life’ so that his image did not stand out at all, nor 
did it stand out to a degree which would make the procedure so unfair such 
that the evidence ought to be excluded” [2 (c)]. 

20. Mr Kelly QC develops this as follows: 

26. The Crown submit that it is a matter for the Court whether, when viewing 
all 14 images together, the photograph of Leon Russell stands out as being 
not ‘in the same position’ or not ‘under identical conditions’ as the other 13 
images. 
 
27. It is submitted that the comparison is not whether Leon Russell’s picture 
stands out when compared only to his brother’s image because there is no 
evidence that Keiran Jackson knew anything about the suspect having a twin 
brother therefore there is no reason for him to focus only on Lee and Leon. 
 
28. The Crown further submits that the eyes can be properly compared as 
between all 14 images. They were a carefully selected set of images which 
meet the test of resembling Leon Russell ‘so far as possible’ in age, general 
appearance and position in life. Such discernible features as there were 
between them might be said to be more apparent to a witness who is himself 
a young black male, as Keiran Jackson is, than to a middle aged Chinese 
woman or an elderly white male. 

 
IV. The witness was shown “full face” photographs 

21. I am reminded that although the witness was only able to see the 

suspect’s eyes at the time of the offence, full‐face photographs of the 
Russell brothers were shown on the parade. 
 
V. The Crown suggest this was an instance of identification rather than 
recognition
--------
22. The defence observes that the Crown’s case is that the witness was 
identifying a stranger, although Leon Russell maintains that he has 
known Kieran Russell since childhood. 
 

23. It is submitted that in all the circumstances admitting the identification 

evidence would have such an adverse effect upon the fairness of the 
trial that it should not be admitted. 

24. The defence submissions include the following final remarks: 

 

 

33.  It  is  submitted  that  the  cumulative  effect  of  these  breaches of  the  Code 
resulted in an identification procedure which was as dangerous and unfair as 
could sensibly be conceived. When consideration is given to the additional 
‘distinctive features’ of the case, this position becomes even more stark. The 
parade  was  conducted  five  years  after  Kieran  Jackson  had  sight  of  the 
individual who entered his flat. His opportunity to view that taller man was 
impeded  by  the  circumstances;  he  was  forced  to  look  down  whilst  in  the 
man’s presence, and the individual had his face covered so that only his eyes 
were  visible.  Even  in  a  recognition  case,  the  limited  view  remains  highly 
relevant;  if  Kieran  knew  the  Russell  twins,  an  identification  founded  upon 
brief glimpses of the taller man’s eyes could not reasonably be said to enable 
anyone to distinguish between them. 
 
34. Furthermore, the identification procedure failed to place the witness in a 
comparable position, in that, the images on the parade depicted full faces. 
Both witnesses made it clear that the suspect’s face was covered from the 
nose down. It would have been possible to pixellate or otherwise obscure the 
lower half of the faces of the images, so that Kieran Jackson’s ability to 
recognise the eyes of the suspect was properly tested. 

 
Decision 

 

25. Neither the Code of Guidance nor any of the jurisprudence concerning 

identification parades addresses the position of identical twins in the 
present context. However, in R v Carl Darren Chapman (No. 
2000/0876/Z3, 24 November 2000), the Court of Appeal dealt with a 
case concerning two identical brothers in which it had been argued that 
given the identification of one of them as a perpetrator was disputed, a 
parade should have been held [7]. In the judgment, the Court 
addressed certain issues relevant to this case, as follows: 

19. During submissions before us, some reference was made to the fact that 
the appellant had a twin. The thrust of the defence case at trial appears to 
have been that the two twins were in looks effectively identical, or that any 
difference lay in fullness of face and changed from time to time. Assuming 
their looks to have been effectively identical, an identification parade could 
not have assisted. If both twins were on the same parade, the police officers 
would have been able to do no more than say that the man seen in Halstead 
was one or other of the two. If only one or other twin was on a parade, the 
officers would presumably have identified whichever was on the parade,
--------
since he would have appeared identical to the man in the photograph. A 
choice between twins of identical appearance must always have depended on 
other considerations – such as ownership of the car and the injuries sustained 
by this appellant. Assuming that there were minor (though perhaps 
changing) features, such as fullness of face, which might have led to some 
differentiation between the twins, the police do not appear to have had any 
notice, or reason to think, at the time that it might have been the appellant’s 
twin […].  

26. Although those conclusions were no doubt apposite in the context of 
the particular facts of that case, so long as the identification procedure 
is conducted in an entirely fair manner, this is essentially a matter for 
the jury. It is undoubtedly the case that some “identical twins” can be 
distinguished from each other, and in my judgment this is an issue that 
ordinarily ought to be explored in evidence during the trial. Although 
the judge may be asked to rule on the sufficiency or reliability of 
evidence of this kind before the jury retires (e.g. at the close of the 
prosecution case or before speeches), it would be wrong to suggest, as 
a matter of usual or invariable practice, that it is pointless to hold an 
identification parade when the suspect has a relevant identical twin. 
Instead, in my view, this issue should be approached by way of an 
assessment of the weight of the evidence rather than applying an 
inflexible principle that an identification parade should never be held. 
 

27. The purpose of an identification procedure is to provide the witness 
with a fair opportunity to identify the suspect, and in order to secure 
this result the latter should be viewed along with others who resemble 
him in general appearance. The prosecution is correct in its suggestion 
that it is permitted for individuals who look roughly alike to be shown 
together in order to avoid the confusion or difficulties that may arise if 
they are viewed on separate parades (R v Wayne Van Der Spuy [2005] 
EWCA Crim 2976; R v Coddington [2005] EWCA Crim 197) and in my 
judgment this requirement applies with greater force to identical twins. 
The stronger the similarity, potentially the more powerful the need to 
hold one rather than two parades in order to establish whether the 
witness is able to distinguish between two individuals who are said 
closely to resemble each other (although I stress that the Code makes 
clear this is not obligatory). Viewing the two people concerned 
together as part of the same process will usually give the witness the 
best opportunity to decide if the perpetrator is one of these two similar 
(or “identical”) members of the line‐up. Otherwise, the witness ought 
to be told to delay making any identification until he has seen both 
parades – “the whole set” – at least twice (Coddington [37]).
--------
28. Furthermore, I accept the prosecution’s submission that if there has 

been a breach of Code D Annex A D:2 in this case, it was not significant 
or substantial, given Inspector Dallimore created a parade which was 
designed to appear as if it comprised 7 pairs of brothers (therefore 14 
people). He clearly attempted to cater for two difficulties: first, the 
need to avoid the risk that the two Russells would stand out as a result 
of their identical appearance; second, by inserting two different 
photographs of the other 6 men it seemed as if there 12 additional 
members of the line‐up. In the result, he created a credible impression 
of a line up of 14 people, composed of 7 pairs of twins. Although there 
were, in fact, only six others (not eight), I have applied the approach of 
the Court of Appeal in R v Maughan (Anthony Paul) [2006] EWCA Crim 
3301 on this issue (see [21]). In the event, there were sufficient members 
of the parade who were, generally speaking, of the same age and 
general appearance as the Russells. However, for reasons set out 
below, I consider it would be safer when “artificial” twins are created 
in this way for the parade to be doubled in size so there are 26 
photographs with (in fact) 14 people (including the suspect and his 
twin) in the line‐up. It is not necessary for me to resolve the issue 
raised in Van Der Spuy [12] as to whether it is necessary to have a pool 
of 14 when the witness is being asked to choose between two similar 
suspects.  

29. In my judgment, the central issue on this application is whether “the 

images used to conduct [the] video identification […], as far as 
possible, show the suspect and other people in the same positions or 
carrying out the same sequence of movements […] under identical 
conditions” (Code D Annex A D:3). Putting the factors concerning Lee 
Russell to one side for a moment, the other members of the line‐up 
bore sufficiently strong similarity to Leon Russell by virtue of age, 
general skin colour, expression and hair (R v Mercedes Nolan [2005] 
EWCA Crim 3661, paragraph 30), and no complaint in this regard has 
been raised.  

30. The determinative consideration is whether Leon Russell was treated 

appropriately and fairly vis‐à‐vis his identical twin. As already 
described, this is not a case in which two suspects of “roughly similar 
appearance” were put on the line‐up, both of whom had potentially 
been seen by the witness as perpetrators. Although it is argued Lee 
Russell played a role in these terrible events, it is not suggested he 
entered the flat. It was critical, therefore, that the witness was placed in 
a position in which he was able to assess whether he could distinguish 
between the two Russells if he selected one of them as the taller of the
--------
two men who forced their way into the flat (remembering that man 
was described as wearing a balaclava or similar piece of clothing which 
covered his face save for the eyes and the skin of the face immediately 
surrounding them). Thus, the central question in judging whether this 
was a fair parade is whether Kieran Jackson was properly able to 
decide whether he could tell Leon and Lee Russell apart. In the context 
of this case, unless the witness was in a position appropriately to make 
this assessment, the parade was inevitably and fatally flawed.  

31. Bearing in mind this identification was made 5 years after the event, 

when the witness was only able to see the eyes of the perpetrator, I am 
unhesitatingly of the view that the line‐up, as regards the photographs 
of Leon and Lee Russell, was unfair. The two photographs differ 
significantly: it is by no means clear that the two men are brothers – let 
alone identical twins – and their appearance is notably dissimilar. Leon 
Russell’s eyes are more clearly revealed than those of his brother (he 
essentially faces the camera rather than looking sideways), and the skin 
colour of Leon is markedly darker. The parade, as constituted, 
demonstrably failed to provide Kieran Jackson with the necessary 
opportunity to decide whether he could distinguish between these two 
identical brothers. In the circumstances of this case, it was critical that 
the images showed the twins under identical conditions: the lighting, 
background, pose, expression and position of the two men should have 
been the same. I repeat, only the eyes were visible when these offences 
were committed and this part of the two men’s bodies should have 
been displayed in the same way, under the same circumstances. 
Additionally, in order for this parade to have been fair, it was 
necessary for the photographs of each of the “sets” of “twins” to have 
been essentially identical (thereby ensuring the Russells did not “stand 
out”) thus enabling the witness to assess whether he was able to 
distinguish between the suspect and his twin. 
 

32. I am acutely aware of the seriousness of this case, and its importance 

for the families of those who were killed and injured, to say nothing of 
our society as a whole. As I made clear in the dismissal decision, I have 
ensured that factual matters that should be determined by the jury are 
not withdrawn from them. However, as the prosecution submits, on 
this issue I am required to make a decision on an aspect of the relevant 
facts. If in my judgment the parade failed to provide the witness with a 
fair opportunity i) to select the suspect as the taller man at the flat and 
ii) to ensure that the witness was properly able to distinguish Leon 
from Lee Russell, the identification evidence would be unfair and it 
would necessarily fall to be excluded under section 78 Police and
--------
Criminal Evidence Act 1984. As regards ii), that is the conclusion I have 
reached, for the reasons set out above. 

33. I wish to make it clear that I do not in any sense hold Mr Dallimore or 
anyone else from the prosecution responsible for this conclusion. As 
already highlighted, the Code and the relevant jurisprudence do not 
provide sufficient assistance to the police as to how identification 
parades in these circumstances should be arranged. The officers 
concerned took substantial steps to address the problems confronting 
them, and their failure to cover all the complex difficulties that have 
been revealed is understandable. The measures they implemented 
were intelligent and imaginative, if ultimately deficient.    

34. The entirety of the case against the four accused depends on the prima 
facie reliability of the identification of Leon Russell by Kieran Jackson. 
Given the conclusion I have just expressed, it follows that this decision 
constitutes a terminating ruling for the purposes of section 58 Criminal 
Justice Act 2003. It is now for the prosecution to decide whether or not 
there is to be an appeal, applying the provisions of section 58 (4).",2012-11-01 00:00:00,UK Crown Court

Judgment 

 
Background and submissions 
 

1.  This decision concerns two reports on the Mail’s Online website concerning 

inadmissible material relating to alleged earlier incidents of violence on the part 
of the defendant. 
 

2.  On 22 May 2012 I decided in a Ruling (handed down in writing) that the 

prosecution was not entitled to introduce evidence of two alleged previous 
incidents of bad character, namely: 
 

FIRST:  Material  relating  to  an  event  on  25th  May  2005  when  the 
defendant was allegedly involved with a number of other officers in the 
arrest  of  Mr.  Owusu‐Afriye.  It  is  alleged  he  used  unnecessary  force  by 
delivering a knee strike to the left side of Mr. Owusu‐Afriye’s torso, in the 
area of his kidneys. 
 
SECOND: Evidence relating to an incident on 24th November 2008 when 
the  defendant  was  involved  with  5  other  officers  in  stopping  and 
searching the vehicle of Mr. Junior Samms, an AA patrolman. The conduct 
of  the  defendant  is  said  to  have  been  the  worst  of  the  policemen  who 
had dealings with Mr. Samms in that it is alleged he twisted Mr. Samms’ 
arm when he was handcuffed and repeatedly told him to “shut up”.
--------
3.  I noted that:  

 

“[…] in support of the two incidents the prosecution have limited their 
application to calling two witnesses only: Mr Ward (a passing member of 
the public) as regards the incident on 25th May 2005 and Mr. Samms for 
the events on 24th November 2008. The Prosecution does not propose to 
call Mr. Owusu‐Afriye, Police Constables Calver, Jury, Leung and Wilson, 
Police Sergeant Paul and a doctor for the incident concerning Mr Owusu‐
Afriye and Police Constables Walker, Mitchell and Jackaman and Police 
Sergeant Bowman and a further officer for the incident concerning Mr 
Samms. The various police constables were present at both events (Police 
Sergeant Paul was also present when Mr Owusu‐Afriye was detained) and 
their statements in varying degrees significantly contradict the accounts 
of the two complainants. 

 

4.  Against that background, I concluded:  

 

“[…] I have no doubt that pursuant to section 101 (3) this material would 
have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the 
court  ought  not  to  admit  it.  The  jury  would  in  effect  have  to  conduct 
three  trials,  the  first  relating  to  the  index  offence  and  the  other  two 
concerning the accused’s alleged propensity to act in the manner alleged 
against  him  on  1st  April  2009.  The  mixed  factual  and  legal  issues  would 
become excessively complex, in that the jury would need to ensure that 
their  approach  to  the  legal  elements  of  the  index  offence  was  only 
properly  influenced  by  their  factual  findings  reached  to  the  criminal 
standard in relation to all three incidents. Given the facts on the central 
incident  are  not  necessarily  at  all  straightforward,  to  add  two  strongly 
disputed  additional  allegations  for  the  purposes  advanced  by  the 
prosecution would undoubtedly put the fairness of these proceedings in 
jeopardy.”  

 

5.  Notwithstanding that Ruling, prior to the commencement of this trial it was 

brought to my attention by the parties that a number of websites run by various 
newspapers and at least one broadcaster contained articles that were readily 
available and dated back to 2010, in which unproven allegations made against PC 
Harwood were rehearsed (these included the Mail, the Telegraph, the Mirror 
and Channel 4 News). By way of example, there continued to be readily available 
on the Mail’s Online website (certainly until late in the trial)                                                                         
the following extract that is taken from a longer article entitled “’Cover‐up’ 
storm over G20 death: Fury as DPP rules policeman who hit news vendor won’t 
be charged” (dated 23 July 2010):
--------
The PC who left under a cloud 
PC Simon Harwood, the officer who was accused of killing Ian Tomlinson, 
left the Met in controversial circumstances several years ago while facing 
misconduct proceedings over an alleged off‐duty road rage incident. 
 
The 43‐year‐old was allowed to retire on ill health grounds because of a 
leg or shoulder injury before the disciplinary case, which is said to have 
involved allegations of violence, it is said.  
 
But after surgery on his injury, he rejoined the force as a civilian operator, 
dispatching officers to calls, and then after being declared medically fit, 
was accepted to join Surrey Police as a PC.  
 
Later, despite the outstanding disciplinary proceedings, he transferred 
back to the Met and was deployed in the riot squad.  
 
Last night Scotland Yard refused to comment on the apparent vetting 
bungle. It said: “It is not appropriate to comment on the officer’s 
employment history‐until the completion of any criminal or misconduct 
proceedings.” 
 
But a source told a Sunday newspaper last year: ‘No former officer with 
an outstanding disciplinary matter should ever be given his job back.” 

 

6.  In addition, other websites such as “Facebook”, ”You Tube” and “38 degree” 

published ‘posts’ which shortly before the commencement of the trial contained 
details of, or referred to, various disciplinary allegations. There were also 
websites or blogs run by particular individuals in which a variety of contributors 
expressed their personal opinions on these issues.  

 
7.  In order to address these concerns, a letter I sent to the parties on 31 May 2012 

was forwarded by the Crown Prosecution Service to those responsible for the 
main websites that contain this material, in the following terms: 

 

I am the trial judge in this case. The defendant, a metropolitan police 
officer, is charged with the manslaughter of Ian Tomlinson during an 
event on 1 April 2009, namely the violent protest in the City of London 
that coincided with the meeting of the G20 group of finance ministers and 
central bank governors from 19 countries and the European Union. 
 
A ruling under the Contempt of Court Act 1981 is in force, and I have 
attached the terms of the order to this letter.
--------
I am concerned about press reports and other material that remain 
available on the internet relating to accusations of bad behaviour that 
have been levelled against the accused that are separate from the 
incident on 1 April 2009 for which he will stand trial, and which are 
inadmissible. The relevant publications include (but this list is not 
exhaustive) i) press reports which were originally published in 2010 and 
which are accessible via various websites; ii) items on “Facebook”, “You 
Tube” and “38 degree” that include “posts” concerning disciplinary (and 
possibly other) allegations; and iii) material on websites (such as 
Wikipedia) or “blogs” on which individuals express their opinion (including 
the Ian Bone blog site, “Raewald” and “Unforgiven”). The websites run by 
newspapers and broadcasters include those hosted by The Telegraph, The 
Mirror, The Mail, The Guardian and Channel 4 News, although it is highly 
likely that this extends to other sources.  
 
Internet service providers, Bulletin Board Operators, Web Hosting Services 
and search engines (such as Google) will need to consider whether they 
are enabling the publication of this material.  
 
None of these separate allegations of bad behaviour will feature in the 
evidence in this case, in part because of a ruling that I handed down on 22 
May 2012 at Southwark Crown Court. 
 
The continued publication of this material on the internet, or elsewhere, 
prima facie constitutes a contempt of court within section 1 of the 
Contempt of Court Act 1981 and it is critical – particularly given the 
impending trial – the Order of the Court is complied with and the 
publication of this information ceases immediately. 
 
Although this material should be removed from the internet forthwith, I 
will hear submissions from any individual or body affected by the 
Contempt of Court Order who wishes to raise any relevant issues during 
the morning of the first day of the trial on 18 June 2012.  

 

 

 

8.  The order referred to in the letter was made on 17 October 2011 by Mr Justice 

Cooke, in the following terms: 

1.  The order made, under section 4(2) of the Contempt of Court Act 1981, by 

the Coroner on 26 April 2011, in the inquest proceedings, is to be 
continued until further order of this Court. The order of 26 April is as 
follows: 

Further to the order made orally by the Coroner on 21 March 
2011, and for the avoidance of doubt, it is ordered that by virtue
--------
of Section 4(2) of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 the publication 
of the Coroner’s ruling of 31 March 2011 and any legal argument 
in the absence of the jury on the topic with which the ruling is 
concerned and this order itself be postponed until further order 
within the proceedings of the inquest, on the ground that it is 
necessary for avoiding substantial risk of prejudice to the 
administration of justice in  these proceedings.  

 

2.  Additional to that order, and for the avoidance of doubt, it is ordered that 

publication of any information about PC Harwood’s personnel record is 
postponed until further order of this Court. This order is made on the 
ground that is necessary to do so to avoid a substantial risk of prejudice 
to the administration of justice in these proceedings pursuant to Section 
4(2) of the Contempt of Court Act 1981.   

 

 

9.  At a hearing I convened on 15 June 2012 to hear submissions from the parties 

and the media as to any further steps that should be taken by the court to 
address the continued availability of the inadmissible evidence on the internet, 
one of the issues that arose was whether articles and comments in this category 
constituted the material publication of information that had been lawfully 
prohibited by Cooke J’s order. Mr Millar Q.C., who represented a number of 
media organisations, submitted the order was unlawful and needed to be 
revised because it related to past reporting rather than relating to the 
proceedings themselves. I acceded to that submission, given that previous 
reports of earlier alleged misbehaviour cannot properly fall within the ambit of a 
power to postpone reports of the proceedings (namely, the trial), and in 
consequence, I revoked paragraph 2 of Cooke J’s Order.  
 

10. Thereafter, I set out in open court a short rehearsal of my views on this issue. I 
had concluded that two principal questions had arisen. The first was whether 
these publications came within the strict liability rule of section 1 of the 
Contempt of Court Act 1981 – namely, the “rule of law whereby conduct may be 
treated as a contempt of court as tending to interfere with the course of justice 
in particular legal proceedings regardless of intent to do so” – because they are 
publications addressed to the public at large or to a section of the public, and 
because they will “create a substantial risk that the course of justice in the 
proceedings in question will be seriously […] prejudiced” (see section 1 and 
section 2 Contempt of Court Act 1981). And, second, whether these publications 
constituted a contempt in the face of the court. 

11. As to the first of those questions, without attempting finally to determine the 

issue for the purposes of these proceedings, I expressed the view that the 
internet articles are “publications” for the reasons set out by Lord Osborne in
--------
Her Majesty’s Advocate against William Frederick Ian Beggs (No2) 2001 Scot (D) 
30/10; 2002 S.L.T. 139. At paragraph 22, the judge in that case observed: 

 

It appears to me unrealistic to make a distinction between the 
moment when the material is first published on the web site and the 
succeeding period of time when it is available for access on demand 
by members of the public. It appears to me that the better view is that 
the situation affecting the web site may be compared with a situation 
in which a book or other printed material is continuously on sale and 
available to the public. During that whole period, I consider that it 
would be proper to conclude that the material was being published. 

12. Addressing whether these publications created a substantial risk that the 

proceedings would be seriously prejudiced, I indicated my view that although 
judicial directions to the jury are usually effective in ensuring the fair trial of the 
accused – in this instance by way of an absolute prohibition on any researches 
into the case or the accused, particularly on the internet – the court should 
nonetheless take all sensible steps to diminish the risk that jurors may read 
inadmissible and prejudicial material. In this context, I noted that it is undisputed 
that the details of the previous allegations levelled at PC Harwood were 
markedly prejudicial. I intended to give (and I gave) the jury a strong warning not 
to use the internet in this regard – a warning that the court is entitled to expect 
will be followed – but applying the approach of Moses LJ in Her Majesty’s 
Attorney General and Associated Newspapers Ltd and News Group Newspapers 
Ltd [2011] EWHC 418 (Admin), I concluded that if this material remained on the 
web and it reached the attention of one or more jurors, it would create a 
seriously arguable ground of appeal. Although the law assumes that a judge, by 
making effective orders, thereby secures a safe verdict (in the circumstances of a 
conviction) that does not negate the contempt caused by the (continued) 
publication of material that created a substantial risk of seriously prejudicing the 
proceedings.  
 

13. I highlighted on 15 June 2012 that it was clear, therefore, that this was not a case 

in which the court was postponing publication of a report of proceedings under 
section 4 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981. Instead, as I viewed the matter at 
that stage on the basis of the submissions of the parties and Mr Millar, the court 
was confronting the kind of rare situation contemplated by Lawton LJ in Balogh v 
St.Albans Crown Court 1975 QB 73, at page 93 when he observed that a trial 
judge should only resort to the summary and – as he described it – draconian 
jurisdiction of summary contempt proceedings “for the purpose of ensuring that 
a trial in progress or about to start can be brought to a proper and dignified end 
without disturbance and with a fair chance of a just verdict or judgment” (page 
93 letter A). Lawton LJ gave a series of examples, as follows:
--------
The exercise of judicial discretion in this way can be illustrated by 
reference to the kinds of contempt which are most frequently 
witnessed by or reported to judges: witnesses and jurors duly 
summoned who refuse to attend court; witnesses duly sworn who 
refuse to answer proper questions; persons in court who interrupt the 
proceedings by insulting the judge, shouting or otherwise making a 
disturbance; persons in court who assault or attempt to assault or 
threaten the judge or any officers of the court whose presence is 
necessary; persons in or out of court who threaten those about to give 
evidence or who have given evidence; persons in or out of court who 
threaten or bribe or attempt to bribe jurors or interfere with their 
coming to court; persons out of court who publish comments about a 
trial going on by revealing a defendant's criminal record when the 
rules of evidence exclude it. 

 
14. I indicated that the last example – revealing a defendant’s criminal record – 

closely matched the situation in the present trial, even allowing for the obvious 
difference as to whether there had been a concluded criminal trial. In the 
context of the violence alleged against Mr Harwood in this trial, these previous 
allegations of violent behaviour leading to misconduct proceedings in the late 
1990s and in 2004 would have had a like effect as the jury reading about 
previous criminal convictions for violence. At that stage, by way of example, 
material on the Telegraph’s website referred to these as two previous inquiries 
into allegations of aggression, and one of them is widely reported to have 
concerned an incident of “road rage” on the part of the defendant. Although the 
second allegation was in some instances reported as not having been 
substantiated by the investigating body, the cumulative reporting of the 
allegations of previous violence on his part created an impression that, in my 
judgment, was not dissimilar to the situation that arises when an accused’s 
previous convictions are improperly revealed.  
 

15. Mr Millar submitted that numerous issues of principle may arise if I were to seek 
to use the Court’s summary powers in this context, but I nonetheless expressed 
the view on 15 June 2012 that as regards publishers within the jurisdiction (such 
as domestic newspapers, broadcasters, bloggers etc.) the position is clear, for 
the reasons just rehearsed. As a result, I stated that if this material was not 
removed by 8.00 am on Monday 18 June 2012 when the jurors who may serve 
on this trial were expected to begin arriving at Southwark Crown Court, those 
responsible were at risk of being in contempt of court.  

16. Additionally, I raised on 15 June 2012 the issue of other individuals who are 

responsible for publishing this material from outside the jurisdiction, along with 
those who provide “caching”, “hosting” or search facilities. I indicated to counsel 
that I needed careful assistance (including possibly expert evidence) as to what,
--------
if any, steps are available to a judge in these circumstances and I asked the 
prosecution and defence to collaborate as a matter of urgency in order to put 
me in a position of being able to deal with this aspect of the prejudicial 
publishing.  

17. As an additional step, I asked the prosecution to use every effort to secure 

voluntary compliance on the part of all concerned, whether within or without 
the jurisdiction. I invited the Attorney General to assist in the process of inviting 
Wikipedia to amend the entry on the relevant web page (given internet searches 
on this subject usually place the Wikipedia entry as one of the first, and at that 
stage it contained references to the disciplinary proceedings). 

18. Finally, on 15 June 2012 I expressed my hope that those responsible for these 
articles – certainly within the jurisdiction – would comply voluntarily with the 
spirit of the views that I expressed, given, in the main, they are major 
broadcasters or publishers.  

19. Once the trial began on Monday 18 June 2012, save for some slight delays in 

removing a small number references to the inadmissible material, broadly 
speaking the press, Wikipedia, the broadcasters and most “bloggers” had 
complied with my request. However, two exceptions were later brought to my 
attention. The Mail Online maintained two articles (certainly for a period during 
the trial), dated 23 July 2010 [5] and 4 September 2010, as follows: 

4 September 2010 
PC Harwood, a member of Scotland Yard’s Territorial Support Group, left 
the Metropolitan Police a decade ago, after an alleged off‐duty road‐rage 
incident for which he was due to face a misconduct hearing, before 
instead retiring on medical grounds.  
 
In 2003 he won a job with Surrey Police, where he was accused of using 
excessive force. He returned to the Met in 2004.  

20.  It followed that the only outstanding issue that I needed to address in the 

closing stages of the trial was what steps, if any, should the court take as regards 
the stance adopted by Associated Newspapers Limited in failing to comply with 
the observations I made on 15 June 2012 and the letter that was circulated. Mr 
Caplan Q.C. submitted that it would be of assistance if the matter could be 
resolved by way of a formal order.  
 

21. On 16 July 2012 I ordered the removal of the two articles in open court, and I 

indicated that these reasons would follow.
--------
22. Mr Caplan, who appeared to argue the matter on 5 July 2012, and by reference 
to his written submissions that principally addressed the application of the strict 
liability rule, advanced the following principal propositions: 

i) 

ii) 

iii) 

iv) 

The Contempt of Court Act 1981 (“CCA”) is concerned with 
material that is published on a contemporary basis and offered to 
readers, and this does not cover items that are stored in “an 
online archive” and which can only be accessed following a 
specific search. 
 
The remarks of Lord Osborne, set out above [11], when he 
concluded that material in an online archive was continuously 
being published for the purposes of the CCA from the moment of 
publication were obiter and are wrong.  

The summary procedure envisaged in Balogh v St Albans Crown 
Court [13] does not have “any application to the strict liability 
rule”. It was noted that this authority antedates the Contempt of 
Court Act and the Human Rights Act 1998, and it was argued that 
proceedings under the strict liability rule can only be brought by 
the Attorney General pursuant to section 7. Thereafter, the issue 
of whether there has been a breach is a value judgment for the 
Administrative Court. Mr Caplan highlighted that the breach of 
the strict liability rule (unlike contempts in the face of the court) 
does not involve an intention to interfere with the course of the 
trial or the deliberate breach of a court order.   

Our system of criminal justice depends on trusting jurors to abide 
by their oath and any judicial directions. Any interference with 
freedom expression must be proportionate and necessary (Article 
10(2) ECHR). In this regard it was argued that it is neither 
proportionate nor necessary to require online archives to be 
sanitised because disobedient jurors might choose to access 
prejudicial material. Such a requirement would not be practical 
and it would have a damaging effect on the future of such 
archives, which are, inter alia, a valuable tool for researchers and 
academics. Mr Caplan relied on the Law Commission's Scoping 
Study No 2 (December 2002) on defamation and the internet in 
which it was indicated ""that it is not practically possible to 
monitor all criminal trials in the country and subsequently to 
remove from internet archives any potentially prejudicial 
material"" (para 5.25). It was suggested that the proportionate 
response is to direct the jurors not to conduct internet research
--------
regarding the case which they are trying in the same way that 
they are directed not to discuss the case outside of the jury room.  

v) 

vi) 

The CCA does not proscribe the publication of prejudicial material 
simpliciter but only the publication of material that creates a 
substantial risk of prejudice. The point was made that 
contemporary publications are to be distinguished from online 
archives because of the need with the latter to apply search 
criteria. 

The Court’s summary powers are not engaged on the facts of this 
case.  

23. On the issue of the steps, if any, that the court should take as regards any 

material that it considers necessary to diminish the risk that jurors may read 
inadmissible and prejudicial reports, Mr Caplan submitted that: 
 

[…] either the material in question constitutes an anticipated contempt 
(in which case an application for an injunction to the High Court may be 
appropriate) or it constitutes an arguable breach of the strict liability rule 
(in which case it is for the AG to decide whether to institute proceedings 
and to apply to the High Court). With regard to applications for an 
injunction, Arlidge Eady and Smith on “Contempt” 4th Ed at paras 6.1 and 
6.2 state that it “will generally be inappropriate for trial judges of the 
Crown Court to entertain applications of this kind … It could rarely be said 
to be necessary, through pressure of time, to take such a step for the 
purpose of protecting the integrity of the trial”.   

 

24. Ms Michalos was instructed by the CPS to assist the court on the approach to be 
taken to the various sources of information that have remained available on the 
internet, and she highlighted that, for the purposes of the CCA, the main issues 
are whether any particular site classes as a “publisher” (section 2(1)) and the 
extent to which the publication creates a substantial risk that the course of 
justice in question will be seriously impeded or prejudiced (section 2(2)). 
Additionally, it was pointed out that under section 3(3) it is necessary, for the 
purposes of strict liability, for the proceedings to have been active at the time of 
publication.  
 

25. With social networking sites, she expressed the view that those that simply 

provide a platform for other users (such as Google) are unlikely to be regarded 
as publishers (but this general statement was somewhat qualified, as set out 
below). She argued that all sites that are essentially facilitators, such as Facebook 
and YouTube, are likely to be treated in the same way. Similarly, with search 
engines and internet service providers (ISPs), she submitted that “the current
--------
state of the law strongly suggests that search engines and mere service 
providers” (e.g. BT and Tiscali who provide access to the internet) “would not be 
held liable for strict liability contempt because they would not be regarded as 
publishers”. In the context of defamation, Ms Michalos suggested that at 
common law if bodies of this kind provide no more than a passive role in 
facilitating postings on the internet, they are not deemed to be a publisher (Bunt 
v Tilley [2006] EWHC 407 (QB); [2006] 3 AER 336). 
 

26.  By way of at least a partial qualification to this general submission, Ms Michalos 
argued that if the ISP is on notice of the material in question then it is possible it 
will be held to be a publisher, in that in determining responsibility the state of a 
defendant’s knowledge could be an important factor. My attention was drawn to 
developing jurisprudence involving Google. In Metropolitan International Schools 
(t/as Train2Game) v Designtechnica & Google [2009] EWHC 1765 Eady J held 
that Google was a mere facilitator rather than a publisher, and that “publication” 
involves a mental element, and this was the case even though Google had taken 
steps to ensure that certain URLs were blocked: the court held that it was 
unrealistic to attribute responsibility for publication to Google ([57] and [64]). 
However, in Davison v Habeeb & others [2011] EWHC 3031, it was decided (HHJ 
Parkes, sitting as a High Court judge) that it was arguable that Google was a 
publisher, rather than a mere facilitator, if it was notified that particular material 
was appearing on a virtual noticeboard for which it was responsible [42]. Eady J 
returned to this general area in Tamiz v Google Inc [2012] EWHC 449 (QB) when 
he held that Google Inc. was not a publisher at common law in respect of Google 
blogs because it was a provider or facilitator. Whilst he held that the mere fact 
that it had been notified of a complaint did not immediately convert its status or 
role into that of a publisher ([38]), he indicated that a decision in this area may 
be fact sensitive ([33]). Eady J set out that liability may turn on the extent to 
which the relevant ISP has knowledge of the words complained of, their illegality 
or potential illegality or the extent to which it has control over publication ([33]). 

27. On the basis of this material, it was submitted by Ms Michalos that unless there 

 

is a reasonably high degree of “active moderation” operated by the site, “it is 
unlikely that an individual social media site would be held to be a publisher for 
strict liability purposes. This is because in most cases there will be an absence of 
the mental element that the authorities suggest is required to render someone a 
publisher.” However, Ms Michalos suggested that it is arguable that once specific 
objectionable material has been drawn to the website’s attention, it becomes a 
publisher for the purposes of strict liability, particularly if – possibly only if – 
specific material on identified web pages are drawn to the company’s attention.  
 

28. In a similar vein, Ms Michalos argued that a similar approach is likely to apply to 

any alleged breaches of a section 4(2) order. Her argument is that “(o)nce 
express knowledge of a court order could be established and attributed to the
--------
website, it seems to be that there are better prospects of establishing that a 
social networking site like Facebook has made a publication in breach of s. 4(2) 
than for a search engine”. This, it is suggested, is subject to a final determination 
as to whether a social networking site is to be regarded as a publisher. It is 
argued that this may be resolved by way of a finding that they are publishers on 
the basis that the site is providing the means of publication and it has the power 
to stop it.  

29. As to “blogs” and other similar content providers, Ms Michalos drew my 

attention to certain practical difficulties, which include identifying individual 
users and the large number that the court would need to deal with. That said, it 
is suggested that it is clear that an individual user who places material on a 
webpage or blog plainly publishes the material (see AG v Pelling [2005] EWCH 
414 (Admin); [2005] Fam Law 854). 

30. Ms Michalos contended that under Regulation 19 of the Electronic Commerce 

(EC Directive) Regulations 2002, most providers of services such as Google blogs 
will have a defence to criminal sanctions for contempt unless there has been 
effective – meaning highly specific – notification of the objectionable material.  

31. Ms Michalos suggested that material published by the general media or in blog 
publications do not fall within the normal understanding of contempt in the face 
of the court as they are removed in terms of time and physical proximity. Whilst 
Ms Michalos accepted in argument that there may be examples of publications 
that could amount to a contempt of this kind – “for example, media publications 
in flagrant disregard of court order or during a trial, publication of past 
convictions in a national newspaper” – she did not accept that the publications 
here qualify, on the grounds that they are “more removed and historic” and they 
in many instances would require a search to find the prohibited material.  

32. In any event, Ms Michalos contended that in this area it would be preferable, 
first, to summon the publisher to the Crown Court to explain its stance, and, if 
the answer is unsatisfactory, thereafter to refer the matter to the Attorney 
General for prosecution. In particular, she argued that given the difficulties in 
establishing strict liability contempt as against the various categories of potential 
contemnor, “it would be unwise to proceed on a summary basis”.  

33. As to the powers of the Crown Court, Ms Michalos reminded me that by section 

45(4) of the Senior Courts Act 1981: 

[…] the Crown Court shall, in relation to […] any contempt of court, the 
enforcement of its orders and all other matters incidental to its 
jurisdiction, have the like powers, rights, privileges and authority as the 
High Court.
--------
34. Aikens J used this provision when he granted an injunction to restrain a 
threatened contempt (Ex p. HTV Cymru (Wales) Ltd [2002] EMLR 184).  
 

35. Given the comprehensive research and assistance provided by Ms Michalos, it is 

useful to set out her overarching conclusion:  

In my opinion, if the Court considers that continuing internet publication 
of historic material is likely to interfere with the administration of justice 
or  cause  prejudice  to  an  ongoing  trial,  the  proper  course  is  for  an 
application  to  be  made  for  an  injunction  against  the  relevant  media 
organisations in the High Court that specifically identifies the material to 
be enjoined and is not unnecessarily wide. If an injunction were granted 
and served, this brings with it a potential advantage of being able to bring 
overseas publishers within the realm of civil contempt if they disobey. It 
may remain to some extent a theoretical advantage as there would still 
be  practical  difficulties  with  enforcement.  However,  in  my  experience, 
reputable corporations beyond the jurisdiction do tend to co‐operate and 
take down material that is prohibited by a court order. 
 

Discussion and conclusions 

36. Although a number of important questions in this general area have been 
canvassed in the submissions of counsel, I have avoided the temptation of 
attempting to resolve issues which are, or have become, irrelevant or which 
have been resolved without the need for any, or any additional, indication or 
order from the court. As set out above, given the cooperative stance of the 
media, the only items that I need to address are the two articles that remained 
on the Mail’s Online website after 18 June 2012. Although one “blog” continued 
to rehearse elements of the inadmissible material, I have not been provided with 
any further details about this suggested publication and I have not received any 
submissions as to how the court should approach the continued availability of 
this prejudicial information.  
 
Are the two articles in the Mail On line “publications” for the purposes of CCA 
section 2(1)? 

37. Publication is defined in section 2(1) CCA as including “any speech, writing, 

programme included in a cable programme service or other communication in 
whatever form, which is addressed to the public at large or any section of the 
public”. I remain of the view that the words “at the time of the publication” in 
section 2(3) encompasses the entire period during which the material is available 
on a website from the moment of its first appearance through to when it was 
withdrawn (see Her Majesty’s Advocate against William Frederick Ian Beggs 
supra and Godfrey v Demon Internet Ltd [2001] QB 201 at 208 – 209). The
--------
distinction Mr Caplan sought to draw between current and archived reports is 
less clear than he suggested in argument. Anyone looking for contemporary 
reports of an ongoing trial will often do so by typing in search terms that are 
likely to reveal a mix of contemporary and earlier information. The “archived” 
material, certainly on the Mail’s Online site, remained readily available, and it 
was revealed by a general search for reports involving PC Harwood or Ian 
Tomlinson. A juror seeking contemporary information could easily have ended 
up viewing the reports that included references to the earlier allegations, 
without necessarily having set out to defy the court’s direction not to conduct 
research. Accordingly, in my judgment the two articles provided by the Mail 
Online continued to be “published” whilst the proceedings were active.   

Do the two articles in the Mail Online create a substantial risk that the course of 
justice in the proceedings in question will be seriously impeded or prejudiced? 

38. As one of the two central questions in the case (the second was causation), the 

jury were directed to consider – when determining whether the push was a 
reasonable use of force – the defendant’s state of mind at the time, and whether 
his actions were guided by his genuine belief as to what was necessary. At the 
heart of that question self‐evidently lay the jury’s assessment of the defendant’s 
honesty (he gave evidence during the trial) and whether his description of only 
taking such steps as he believed were necessary was truthful. If jurors had 
accidentally discovered (in the circumstances I have described above) that he 
had an alleged history of violent and irrational behaviour, their judgment on the 
issue of his honest belief was likely to have been prejudiced. This was highly 
damaging material that went directly to one of the two cardinal issues in the 
case.  
 

39. As I have already indicated, both articles were extremely easy to find on the 

newspaper’s website, and I have been guided by the line of authority that it is 
sufficient for a finding of contempt that the court makes the assumption that if 
the offending publication reached the attention of a juror, this would have 
created a seriously arguable ground of appeal (see Her Majesty’s Attorney 
General and Associated Newspapers Ltd and News Group Newspapers Ltd 
above). As just indicated, a juror looking for contemporary articles on the trial 
(which is entirely permissible) could, with little effort or by accident, have come 
across either of these articles, and accordingly I am of the view that their 
publication constituted a substantial risk of impeding or prejudicing the course of 
justice. 

What steps should the court take? 

40. The approach to be taken by the court will always depend on the circumstances. 
It may be appropriate to refer the matter to the Attorney General for a possible 
prosecution or to suggest to the party that is troubled by the continuing 
publication that it should consider making an application to the High Court for an
--------
injunction. The circumstances will be infinitely various, but if the Crown Court is 
to resolve the issue, its ability to deal with matter effectively and fairly is critical. 
The Crown Court judge will usually have a good understanding of the issues in 
the case and the likely impact of the information if read by a juror; there may be 
time constraints, with an impending trial that would be prejudiced if delayed; 
and this issue will usually be of greatest concern to the defendant who, 
particularly if funded by the Legal Services Commission, may not be able to meet 
the costs of an approach to the High Court.  
 

41. The circumstances relating to these two publications were straightforward. The 

publisher is based in the UK and was readily identifiable; the material 
complained about was equally clear (two on‐line news articles); I reached 
conclusions without difficulty, on the basis of my involvement in the case, as to 
its potential to cause prejudice; and this debate originally occurred in the 
context of a trial that was about to start, and this particular issue only 
crystallised whilst it was ongoing. In these circumstances, as trial judge I 
considered that I was well placed to deal with the problem, and any other 
remedy was likely to cause delay, expense and prejudice to the defendant and 
the witnesses (viz. an application to the High Court), or it may be ineffective to 
prevent prejudice to the trial (viz. a prosecution by the Attorney General). 

42. Section 45 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 gives the Crown Court the same 

power and authority as the High Court as regards any contempt of court. Aikens 
J in Ex p. HTV Cymru (Wales) Ltd indicated at [23]:  

There is no general power in the Crown Court to grant injunctions. But I 
am satisfied that the Crown Court has the power to grant an injunction to 
restrain a threatened contempt of court in relation to a matter that is 
before the Crown Court in question. Whether an injunction should be 
granted will depend, of course, on whether all the conditions are fulfilled 
in the case at issue.  

43. I am satisfied to the criminal standard that the two publications constitute a 

contempt of court under the strict liability rule. I am equally certain that issuing 
an injunction for the relatively short period of this trial was necessary and 
proportionate, and that in taking this step I was not acting in a way that is 
incompatible with the right of freedom of expression under Article 10(1) of the 
European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms. This order, in my judgment, was necessary under Article 10(2). The 
means employed (ordering the removal of two articles for a short period of time) 
was proportionate to the need I have identified (ensuring the fair trial of the 
accused by avoiding serious prejudice). I had in mind that injunctions of this kind 
are rarely appropriate, but in the instant case the threat was specific and could 
be satisfactorily defined, and the failure to grant this injunction ran the risk of far
--------
greater prejudice than if I granted the injunction (to paraphrase Aikens J in Ex p. 
HTV Cymru (Wales) Ltd [35]). 
 

44. In all the circumstances, on 16 July 2012 I ordered the removal of the two 

articles. Since the trial is now at a close, it is clearly unnecessary for the Court to 
consider resorting to its summary contempt powers.",2012-07-24 00:00:00,UK Crown Court

Indictment No. T2009 7188 

 

14 August 2012 

Sentencing Remarks of His Honour Judge John Evans 

R 
-v- 

Anton Benjamin Vickerman 

 

Anton Vickerman you are 38 years of age. I now have to sentence you for the two offences of 
conspiracy to defraud of which you were convicted by a jury at the conclusion of the trial held 
earlier this year and which lasted over 7 weeks. The conspiracies spanned the periods February 
2007 to November 2009 

You were the creator of a web site Surf the Channel (STC) which you set up and operated from 
your home in Gateshead. In brief your web site was designed to make available to the general 
public films, television programmes and popular music which they could stream or if they chose 
to, download to their computers. The vast majority of the material made available through that 
web site, infringed copyright. The trial was not concerned with the music made available in this 
way rather it concentrated on copyright infringement of television programmes and films. Much 
of the evidence in the case centred on the way in which the website enabled the public, entirely 
free  of  charge  to  watch  mainstream  films,  in  some  relatively  few  cases  before  the  film  had 
received its theatrical release in this country and in many cases within hours or days after that 
release. By way of example only Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull received its 
theatrical release in the UK on the 22nd May 2008. Within 24 hrs, as many members of the public 
were filing into the cinemas in their thousands, paying at the box office, people accessing STC 
could stream the film to their own computers enabling them to watch it or to download it for 
free. A month later, on the 26th June 2008 the Chronicles of Narnia, Prince Caspian, another
--------
highly popular film particularly with children was given its theatrical release. Those who chose to 
go the STC web site in this country could watch the film for free, four weeks earlier on the 23rd 
May, when it was possible to download or stream the film to their computers through STC.  

Your employment history included acting as a DJ, first here in England and then in Tenerife. 
When you returned to this country in 2001 with your wife Kelly, you worked with BT first as an 
engineer and then as a trainer.  The development of problems in your back, which has left you 
with a degree of disability and the time which you found on your hands as a result, seems to have 
encouraged  your  growing  interest  in  the  internet,  internet  forums  and  the  possibilities  which 
those communities presented. It became as you yourself described it during the trial, a passion. 
Over the years that followed and up till 2007, you were involved with a number of web sites the 
technology  behind  which  I  am  perfectly  satisfied  was  later  used  to  effect  in  the  creation 
promotion  and  operation  of  STC.  Supernova,  SFD  Hostings  ,  Snarf  It,  Torrent  Rat  and 
Newzmonster were all sites with which you were linked all of which in one way or another using 
the technology available were operating in a way which infringed copyright. Having said that I 
make it clear that your involvement with those organisations does not in any way impact upon 
my approach to what is the appropriate sentence, it is merely part of the history which led to the 
creation of STC. Much of the trial concentrated on the variety of ways in which it was possible 
to obtain copyright material, also upon the variety of sources. In some case this was achieved by 
gaining  access  to    screeners,  copies  of  films  put  out  in  advance  of  theatrical  release  by  the 
industry and made available to limited members of the industry but which unhappily would find 
their  way  into  the  public  domain  and  illegally  so.  Torrent  sites,  NBZ  files  and  peer  to  peer 
networks were the stuff on which STC was largely based.  

STC you said was your answer to the absence of a search engine providing users of the world 
wide web with a convenient and easy means of searching for particular videos of films or TV 
programmes.  Apart  from  Google  and  You  Tube  there  was  little  else.  Another  company,  TV 
Links  had  already  engaged  in  a  similar  operation  but  you  believed  you  could  do  better.  You 
pressed on knowing that TV Links had been taken down following the intervention of FACT on 
the  basis  that  what  it  had  been  doing  was  unlawful.  The  demise  of  that  enterprise  you  say 
prompted an acceleration through 2007 of STC and the posting on STC of a first link to a movie 
on Christmas Day 2007. The site grew rapidly with the assistance of the various volunteers that 
you recruited to help with the operation of the site; the link hunters that you relied on to locate 
the film files on 3rd party sites often Chinese sites and then posting links to those sites on STC 
and in some cases locating the film files themselves and upload those files to the Chinese sites or
--------
third party sites beyond the jurisdiction and then posting links to those same films on STC. In 
conducting the web site in this manner you believed you could do so with impunity believing 
that you could make the films available to the users of your own site but remain immune from 
prosecution; the moderators whose task it was to check the links to verify that the links would 
enable users to access the films in a version that was comprehensible in an English form. You 
engaged a whole raft of assistants whose task was to provide the means by which within months 
of  its  launch  the  site  became  one  of  the  most  popular  sites  on  the  worldwide  web.  You 
maintained at the trial that your primary focus was never films but rather it was TV material. 
That protestation I totally reject. It was evident to me that your primary concern was mainstream 
films. That it was your main concern was evidenced by Brendan de Beasi and Pascal Hertscholtz 
at the meeting you had with him in July 2008. When cross examined about why it was that you 
thought so many people were watching the films that were being posted through the STC site, 
you  said  that  it  never  crossed  your  mind  that it  might  be  because  they  were  recently  released 
films. That answer suggested a naivety on your part that I completely discount.  

The chat logs, the emails, the forum messages passing between yourself and the various people 
that worked for you establish in my judgement quite clearly that contrary to your assertion that 
you  believed  what  you  were  doing  was  lawful,  you  knew  fine  well  that  it  was  not.  You  were 
plainly aware that the way in which you operated the site was one in which you were going to 
attract the attention of FACT and the MPAA and although you chose to cast their interest  as 
that of jealous competitors,  the reality was that they could see that you were deliberately acting 
in a way which was contrary to the  interests of their membership, making available films in a 
manner that compromised their absolute entitlement to exploit their products to the full and in 
the way that they as the owners of the material chose. You question that entitlement. Given that 
you were not contributing a penny to their investment merely exploiting it for your own personal 
gain, it’s difficult to comprehend how you believed you were entitled to act as you did. 

By April 2008 you had 40,000 links on STC of which 2000 links were to movies. By August the 
following year the links had grown to 2m of which in March 2009 there were in excess of 5500+ 
links created to movies where copyright was being infringed.  

When  it  was  suggested  in  cross  examination  that  it  was  obvious  that  the  films  that  you  were 
posting  links  to  were  to  links  to  recent  films  and  that  you  were  helping  people  to  link  to 
copyright infringing films, you insisted that you couldn’t know if it was infringing copyright, that 
the  studious  might  have  granted  right  holder  licences  to  the  films  of  which  you  had  no
--------
knowledge. That was certainly true and bound to be true if you didn’t bother to check with the 
copyright owners and check you most certainly didn’t.  

Why did STC become so popular. Why of the millions of web sites out there on the worldwide 
web did STC rise to become the 514th most popular site out of hundreds of millions of websites 
which exist. The answer is obvious because it was enabling access to material that millions of 
users wanted, that for the most part they could not access elsewhere or at least could not access 
as easily as they could at STC in an area where competition was limited, because it was unlawful. 
By this means you were able to present STC as a very  attractive  proposition for advertisers who 
were  unquestionably  more  than  willing  to  enter  contracts  for  the  deployment  of  their 
advertisements on STC knowing that the adverts would reach  huge audiences logging on to the 
site.  

In  all  of  this  you  were  anxious  as  far  as  possible  to  keep  both  your  location  and  your  own 
personal identity secret. You figured that by doing so the task of tracking you down and policing 
your  operation  would  be  the  more  difficult.  You  hoped  that  by  registering  the  domain  name 
remotely and setting up servers outside the UK that you would be both difficult to trace and be 
able thereby to escape the legislative regime that you knew you were offending. That you knew 
that what you were doing was unlawful was all to evident from the e mails that you exchanged 
with de Beasi, in which you communicated to him albeit in short form, the advice that you were 
receiving  from  the  various  lawyers  that  you  sought  advice  from.  It  may  be  that  some  of  the 
advice you received was inconsistent but you were plainly being warned about the fact that STC 
was  operating  contrary  to  law  and  of  the  consequences  of  continuing  that  operation.  Your 
response was to try with the help of de Beasi and your work force to present STC in a manner 
which while still providing the main service that users of the site wanted, namely access to newly 
released films, the site took on the appearance of trying to operate within the law; flooding the 
site with “legals” links to material that came from rights holder sites. proclaiming that STC had a 
policy of compliance with take down notices, when in fact what you were doing was engaging in 
a  game  of  cat  and  mouse  with  the  industry,      posting  links  to  films  that  you  knew  fine  well 
infringed copyright and then putting barriers in the way of the copyright holders in their efforts 
to get you to take down the material , and in any event only after much of the damage had been 
done.  As  we  saw  in  the  trial  some  of  the  most  popular  films  like  “Harold  and  Kumar  go  to 
Guantanomo Bay” were watched by hundreds of thousands of people within hours of its posting 
on STC .
--------
When FACT eventually tracked you down in July 2008 and then descended on your home in 
August they seized your computers. Your arrest and the interviews that followed did not act as 
any  kind  or  warning  about  the  criminal  activity  in  which  you  were  engaged  or  as  any  sort  of 
barrier  to  the  continued  operation  of  STC.  With  an  arrogance  of  a  kind  that  you  displayed 
repeatedly during your evidence at the trial you carried on as before and indeed only shut down 
STC, days before this trial began in May. It was as if by maintaining the site you were able to 
persuade yourself that you were doing nothing wrong. You refused then and continue to refuse 
to recognise and by your demeanour in the dock now it is obvious that you refuse to accept that 
you  were  doing  anything  improper.  The  investigation  was  unquestionably  hampered  by  your 
inability or as I believe it to be, your unwillingness to disclose the password to your computer 
which would have allowed for a much swifter and doubtless very much easier interrogation of it. 
You claimed that you were unable to recall the password without access to a key board. That I 
do not accept. You demonstrated in the trial that you are an intelligent man whose power of 
recall of minute details of the investigation and the operation of the site, illustrated the absurdity 
of the suggestion that you needed access to a keyboard in order to recall the password. In my 
judgement  you  were  deliberately  obstructing  the  investigation.  It  was  some  time  before  the 
investigation  team  and  doubtless  at  considerable  expense  were  able  to  unlock  the  encryption. 
Released on bail within hours you had secured a new computer and carried on exactly as before 
even as these proceedings commenced, right up to the very eve of the trial. . 

This case has a very unhappy history of delay. Applications to dismiss, applications for additional 
disclosure, applications to the DPP inviting the DPP to take over the prosecution for want of 
bona fides on the part of the prosecutors, applications to stay the indictment as an abuse of the 
process meant that the case instead of being tried in October 2010 was put back again and again, 
and for over a year. When the case was listed for the third time in November last year, once 
more it had to be vacated on account of the fact that you had travelled to Majorca, from where 
on account of your medical condition, you were unable to return for trial. Thus it was in May of 
this year nearly 4 years after you had been arrested, that the case came to be tried. I do not add 
to your sentence for the various delays that have occurred in this case, because you were entitled 
to  make  the  various  applications  that  have  been  made  that  have  occasioned  this  delay,  but 
neither do I discount the sentence to reflect the fact that the court is now passing sentence such 
a long time after the commission of many of the events which gave rise to your prosecution.  If 
you  have  experienced  additional  stress  during  that  time,  much  of  it  is  entirely  of  your  own 
making.
--------
In determining the appropriate sentence I have to make an assessment of the loss to the film 
industry  resulting  from  your  conduct.  That  is  an  all  but  impossible  task.  The  Prosecution 
estimate the loss at running into hundreds of millions of pounds. That estimate is based on the 
loss of revenue from STC’s provision of the means to access the top 50 films during the period 
covered by the indictment. It is put at between £52 and £198 million. Those figures are based on 
their research suggesting that 55% of those who accessed the films for free would, had they been 
unable  to  watch  them  for  free,  have  paid  either  through  the  box  office  to  watch  the  film  or 
rented a DVD. Others would have purchased the film on the High Street and others would have 
viewed it on pay TV or downloaded it from an official site. In reality it is somewhat speculative 
very difficult to calculate the loss to the industry but that pirating films in the way that you did, 
does expose the industry to the likelihood of huge losses. I accept that any assessment of the loss 
to the industry is highly speculative and while I do not deal with you on the basis of the figures 
advanced  by  the  prosecution,  there  is  no  doubt  in  my  judgement  but  that  the  industry  has 
suffered a loss running into millions.  That is one of the reasons why these cases attract indeed 
demand  deterrent  sentences  as  the  various  authorities  that  I  have  been  provided  with  amply 
demonstrate.  

Leaving  aside  the  loss  to  the  industry  I  am  bound  to  take  account  of  the  gain  which  you 
personally made from running STC. I have not seen statements from the bank account that you 
had  in  Latvia  but  I  have  seen  certified  accounts  and  draft  accounts  for  the  business  which 
provide some insight into how much the business generated from advertising. In the two years 
2009  though  to    2011  it  produced  a  profit  of  £250,000  from  a  turnover  of  just  under  £1m, 
although it ii is said to have dropped rapidly thereafter,  doubtless as the efforts of FACT and 
the MPAA  to thwart the operation of STC began to take effect. In July 2008 the income from 
advertising  was  averaging  between  £10k  and  £15k  and  in  mid  2009  between  £50k  and  £60k 
albeit that was said to be a freak month. Your expenditure was limited because most of those 
with whom you conspired, worked for nothing or in the case of Brendan de Beasi comparatively 
little. These figures however demonstrate the potential for personal exploitation of a product in 
respect of which you made no contribution whatsoever.  

Pirating of films in this way plainly has a huge impact upon the film industry.  

If  the  producers  are  unable  to  exploit  the  product  in  which  they  have  invested,  then  almost 
certainly the film will not make a profit. Whether  made by the major film studios or the smaller 
production  companies,  if  films  fail  to  make  a  profit  or  at  the  very  least  break  even,  then  the 
incentive  to  produce  films  diminishes  and  with  it  goes  what  has  been  a  major  source  of
--------
entertainment to millions world wide for over a century. In the course of the trial we heard from 
at  least  one  Vice  President  of  the  major  film  studios  who  said    that  as  a  result  of  piracy  she 
already senses that there are many less block buster movies being produced as their  studios, as 
the  studio  looks  to  avoid  losses  which  undermine  the  industry.  There  may  be  those  who 
commiserate with you, those who have accessed films for free and wish they were still able to. 
The  reality  is  that  fraud  of  this  kind  impacts  upon  everyone.  It’s  not  just  the  directors,  the 
producers, the script writers, special effects, musicians, stuntmen, who may be well remunerated, 
who  are  affected  by  piracy  but  also  everyone  of  those  persons  whose  titles  come  up  on  the 
closing credits of most films like the key grip or the main gaffer or the best boy. It’s not just the 
film  makers  whose  interests  are  represented  here  but  all  of  those  other  interests  that  are 
encompassed  within  the  film  industry,  the  cinemas  and  all  the  service  industries,  high  street 
shops,  film  rental  companies  and  the  like,  the  livelihood  of  whose  employees  depend  on  the 
industry surviving. Also affected are the end users, the general public. If films are unable to make 
a profit the producers won’t bother and the industry which we all to a greater or lesser extent 
reap the benefit of in terms of the entertainment it provides, will first increase the box office 
prices as they endeavour to counter the lost revenue from piracy and ultimately may choose to 
stop making films altogether.  So we are talking about millions of people here whose lives are 
prejudiced by this unlawful activity.       

A  further  consideration  is  the  loss  occasioned  by  this  unlawful  activity  to  HM  Customs  and 
Revenue.  The  industry  contributes  significant  corporation  tax  to  the  Treasury  and  all  those 
individuals  whose  incomes  derive  from  and  are  dependent  on  the  industry  prospering,  also 
contribute substantially in tax.  

You demonstrate a complete absence of remorse. In the trial you levelled criticism of virtually 
everyone involved in this investigation. You would not countenance and it’s evident from your 
demeanour now, that you still do not countenance the idea that you were doing anything wrong. 
I’m  bound  to  say  that  in  all  the  years  I’ve  worked  in  this  court  I  have  never  encountered 
arrogance of the kind that you displayed during the trial.  Once again while I do not add to the 
sentence I impose for these offences to reflect your absence of remorse, neither does it not allow 
me to reduce the sentence. At the end of the day the only mitigation that you have is the fact that 
you were until your involvement in these offences a man of good character. Given your intellect 
you could have employed it in a lawful way and doubtless to considerable effect. You chose to 
deploy it illegally and for that you must now pay the penalty. You say that you have lost much 
already; your marriage which may not have been enhanced by these proceedings but which you
--------
by your conduct brought about. Your wife gave evidence in the trial and the jury may well have 
accepted this, that had you told her what you were doing shared it with her, she would have done 
her best to stop you because she realised even with her limited understanding of the nature of 
STC that what you were doing was wrong. It was an obsession with the popularity of your web 
site and the money it generated that seems to have been the major factor in the breakdown and 
that ultimately caused the break up of your marriage as more and more you were pre-occupied 
with STC and neglected her.  As for your financial difficulties well once again you are the author 
of your own misfortune and that attracts little sympathy.  

I accept that in terms of culpability, this may not be the worst form of conspiracy to defraud, 
there  are  much  worse  forms  that  one  can  contemplate  but  that  you  engaged  in  deliberate 
dishonesty  is  what  the  jury  found  and  I  cannot  regard  your  conduct  as  attracting  only  the 
minimal condemnation that Mr Wallbank invites. I have to have regard to the various authorities 
that have been put before me albeit none of them are on all fours with this case. Comparisons 
with the music industry I find unhelpful. Music is a very different commodity to film. 

I have to strike a balance here recognising as I do that a very long sentence is no more likely to 
impact  upon  you  than  a  shorter  one.  On  the  other  hand  those  who  are  inclined  to  conduct 
themselves  as  you  have  need  to  understand  that  in  doing  so  they  put  themselves  at  risk  of 
serving a lengthy prison sentence. The sentence is one of four years imprisonment on each count 
to be served concurrently. 

In addition and having regard to the way in which you conducted yourself as a director of the 
company Scopelight Ltd,  which you utilised to give effect to this business, I’m satisfied that it is 
appropriate to disqualify you from holding the office of a director or from acting  as the receiver 
of a company’s property or in any way either directly or indirectly being  concerned or taking  
part in the promotion  formation or management of a company without leave of this court or 
having  regard  to  your  expressed  intention  to  become  a  lawyer  from  acting  as  an  insolvency 
practitioner for a period of 5 years.",2012-08-15 00:00:00,UK Crown Court

SENTENCING REMARKS

2.	 

 
3.	 

The  Defendant  Lion  Steel  has  pleaded  guilty  to  the  offence  of  corporate 
manslaughter, arising out of the death of its employee Steven Berry on 29th May 
 
2008. at the factory premises in Hyde of the Defendant. Mr Berry fell some 13 
metres to his death through a skylight in a roof, on to which roof he had gone to 
repair a leak. I shall say more about the circumstances of his death in a moment. 

 
Before I say anything else, I should deal with the effect of his tragic death on his 
family. This awful accident happened while his wife was on holiday with her 
mother  and  daughter.  She  has  now  lost  her  husband  after  20  years  of  being 
together. It has left a gaping void in her life and that of his children.  Mrs Berry 
and  other  members  of  the  family  sat  here  throughout  the  trial,  and  behaved 
throughout with the utmost dignity. 

Lion Steel is not a large firm. I had material put before me showing that there 
 
are  many  members  of  the  same  families  working  there,  and  the  workforce  is 
close knit.  I have no doubt that his death was a tragedy also felt by everyone 
there, including those who run the company.  

History of the case 

 
4.	 

 
5.	 

 
I  must  deal  with  this  to  set  in  context  some  observations  which  I  shall  make 
about the Crown’s case in due course. 
There was originally an indictment containing 5 counts. That indictment alleged 
 
the following 

 

(a)	  Count 1; corporate manslaughter against Lion Steel contrary to section 1 
of  the  Corporate  Manslaughter  and  Corporate  Homicide  Act  2007.  It 
 
alleged that on 29th May 2008, the Defendant “ ……being an organisation, 
namely a corporation, and because of the way in which the organisations’ 
activities  were  managed  or  organised  by  its  senior  management,  caused 
the  death  of…..Steven  Berry  by  failing  to  ensure  that  a  safe  system  of 
work  was  in  place  in  respect  of  work  undertaken  at  roof  height,  which 
failure amounted to a gross breach of a relevant duty of care owed by it, to 
the deceased.” 

 

2
--------
(b)	  Count 2 alleged manslaughter against three directors of the Defendant, Mr 
Palliser, Mr Williams, and Mr Coupe. It was the Crown’s contention that 
each was under a personal duty of care towards the company’s employee 
Mr Berry, and that he died as the result of what the Crown say was their 
gross negligence, or to put it another way, the gross breach of the duty of 
care  the  Crown  asserted  was  owed  by  them  as  directors  to  him  as  an 
employee. 

 

(c)	  Count  3  alleged  that  Lion  Steel  failed  to  discharge  a  duty  pursuant  to 
 
section  2  of  the  Health  and  Safety  at  Work  Act  1974  (“  HSWA”).  It  is 
alleged  that  as  Mr  Berry’s  employer,  it  failed  to  ensure  so  far  as  was 
reasonably practicable the safety of employees working at height.  

 

 
(d)	  Count 4 alleged that the three director Defendants committed the offence 
 
of neglect, contrary to section 37 of HSWA. It alleged that the failure by 
Lion Steel in Count 3 was attributable to their neglect. 

 

 

  
(e)	  Count 5 alleged against Lion Steel that there was a contravention of the 
Work at Height Regulations 2005 (and therefore an offence was alleged 
under section 33 of HSWA) because no suitable and sufficient measures 
were taken to prevent, so far as was reasonably practicable, persons falling 
a distance likely to cause injury. 

 

6.	  On  4th  May  2012  at  a  preparatory  hearing,  I  severed  Count  1  from  the 
indictment. I did so because it would have been difficult in the extreme to try it 
alongside  the  count  of  manslaughter  against  the  three  directors,  for  reasons 
 
connected  with  the  fact  that  the  Act  is  not  retrospective.  That  requires  some 
explanation. 

 
7.	 

 

The Crown contended before me that while the Crown would call evidence of 
failures in management and gross breaches of duty which occurred before the 
commencement date, it based its case on Count 1 on what occurred or did not 
occur  after  6th  April  2008.  In  a  nutshell  it  said  that  the  duty  of  care  existed 
 
before and after the commencement date, and that what had been a gross  breach 
by omission continued thereafter. It contended that in considering whether the 
duty  was  complied  with  after  6th  April  2008,  and  in  considering  whether  any 

3
--------
breach of it was gross, it was entitled to call evidence of the history before the 
commencement date, and to refer to the length of time that had elapsed since 
matters were first brought to the company’s and managers’ attention.  

 
8.	 

 
I ruled that the Crown could not look to evidence of activities or whether they 
involved  a  breach  or  a  gross  breach,  where  such  activities,  breach  or  gross 
breach occurred before the date of commencement, save insofar as they were 
 
relevant to the existence of a duty on and after that date, or whether a breach 
 
after  that  date  was  a  “gross  breach.”  However  I  also  ruled  that,  when 
considering  whether  that  gross  breach  had  occurred  after  the  commencement 
date, evidence of events or knowledge before that were relevant insofar as they 
went to whether the breach was gross. My ruling contained this passage 

“(Count 1 may proceed) providing that the jury is only asked to consider 
events before 6th April 2008 in the context of 

 
(a)	 

 

their  decision  as 

 
the  senior 
informing 
management knew of facts as at 6th April 2008 or later, or  
(b)	  whether  their  knowledge  of  past  events  rendered  their 
 
conduct as at 6th April 2008 or afterwards as amounting to 
a gross breach of the duty upon them. 

to  whether 

Section 27 of the Act is not an exercise in amnesia, but it is an exercise 
in  preventing  the  punishment  as  criminal  of  activities  which  occurred 
before the Act came into force.” 

 

9.	  However while evidence of matters capable of constituting conduct amounting 
to  gross  negligence  by  the  director  Defendants,  but  occurring  before  the 
commencement  of  the  2007  Act,  was  not  admissible  for  the  purposes  of  that 
count, it was admissible in the context of the allegation in Count 2 against the 
director Defendants. I ruled that a joint trial would have required directions to 
the  jury  of  baffling  complexity,  which  directions  would  probably  have  been 
 
ineffective. A copy of the ruling is attached as an appendix to these remarks.  I 
also stayed the last count. There was no appeal against that ruling.  

 

 

 
10.	  The result was that a jury was empanelled to hear the trial of the three directors 
 
for  manslaughter  at  common  law  and  the  statutory  offence  of  neglect,  and  of 
Lion Steel for breach of the Health and Safety at Work Act. That trial heard the 
prosecution’s  case  on  those  three  counts  over  some  three  weeks.  In  fact,  the 
prosecution’s case against Lion Steel for corporate manslaughter was effectively 
the case it ran against the three directors. But I must be careful at the sentencing 
 

 

4
--------
stage  to  adhere  to  the  ruling  I  gave,  and  only  deal  with  any  gross  breach 
occurring from the date of commencement. 

 

11.	  There  was  no  appeal  by  any  party  against  my  rulings.  I  should  add  for 
completeness that I had on 29th February 2012 refused to dismiss the charges 
against Mr Coupe on an application pursuant to paragraph 2 of Schedule 5 of 
the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. 
 

 

12.	  Once  the  trial  was  under  way,  the  Crown  called  its  evidence  on  what  had 
 
 
occurred, including the evidence it said showed gross negligence by the director 
Defendants. On 2nd July 2012, I gave my ruling on submissions of no case to 
answer  made  by  the  three  directors.  I  ruled  that  in  the  cases  of  two  directors 
 
(Williams and Coupe) there was no case to answer on the manslaughter count, 
 
and in the case of Mr Williams also no case to answer on the count of neglect. 
In the case of the prosecution of Mr Williams, I considered then, and do now, 
that it was a case that should never have been brought. In the case of Mr Coupe 
 
a weak but arguable case on manslaughter disappeared during the prosecution 
case, and there just remained a case on neglect. I should add for completeness 
that prosecuting authorities in cases of gross negligence manslaughter alleged 
against  individuals would be well advised to grapple with the height of the bar 
set by the House of Lords and the Court of Appeal; see R v Adomako [1995] 1 
AC 171, R v Singh (Gurphal) [1999] CLR 582, Misra [2004] EWCA Crim 2375 
and Yaqoob  [2005] EWCA Crim 2169. I also derived great assistance from the 
ruling  of  Mackay  J  in  the  prosecution  of  those  individuals  alleged  to  have 
committed gross negligence manslaughter in connection with the fatal Hatfield 
 
train crash. It appears that his wise words may not have received the attention 
from this prosecuting authority which they deserved. 

 

13.	  After I had delivered my ruling, the prosecution informed me that it would not 
seek to appeal my ruling. All parties asked for time.  Lion Steel then pleaded 
 
guilty to the count alleging corporate manslaughter, and the prosecution offered 
no evidence against Messrs Palliser or Coupe on the remaining counts. Williams 
 
and Coupe were to be acquitted on my direction anyway on the manslaughter 
count. Not Guilty verdicts were entered against the directors on all counts. 
I am bound by those verdicts, and the personal levels of fault of those named 
directors is irrelevant, save insofar as it falls within the purview of what has to 
 
be shown to establish corporate manslaughter.  I shall also pass comment in due 

 
14.	 

 

5
--------
course on some other claims made by the Crown about the responsibilities of 
 
the Directors, some of which are wide of the mark. 

The facts of the accident, and the nature of the breach of duty by the company 

 

15.	  Mr  Berry  was  employed  as  a  maintenance  man  at  Lion  Steel  equipment  in 
 
Hyde.  The  factory  was  one  of  two  owned  by  Lion  Steel  Equipment  Limited. 
One  was  at  Hyde  in  eastern  Greater  Manchester  about  4  ½  miles  from  the 
Derbyshire border, and the other was about 50 miles away at Saltney which lies 
on the Welsh border with Cheshire, just west of Chester. 

 

16.	  Mr Berry worked at Hyde doing maintenance work. Parts of the roof had been 
replaced in the recent years before the incident, and parts had not. The parts that 
had not been replaced included a section of metal roof running up at a pitch of 
about 22 degrees to a ridge. To one side of the roof (which I shall call Side A) 
lay a valley between it and a parallel section of ridged roof. On the opposite side 
it  ran  down  to  a  valley  against  a  wall  ,  in  which  were  two  office 
(Side  B) 
 
windows. At one end was a gable wall, with asphalt flashing covering the joint. 
Further from the wall- about 15 metres away-  the roof consisted of fairly new 
 
metal  sheeting  with  a  trapezoidal  cross  section.  Set  into  it  were  fibreglass 
 
skylights,  but  each  was  separated  by  the  width  of  about  3  to  4  metal  panels. 
 
However  nearer  the  gable  wall  the  roof  consisted  of  older  metal  corrugated 
sheeting which was sinusoidal in cross section, being less sturdy that then the 
trapezoidal kind. Within that older section, which is about 15 metres long, there 
was a rectangular area on Side A below the ridge, but running parallel to it. In 
that section, the roof panels consisted of translucent fibreglass roof panels, each 
 
about 600 mm wide and 2.4 metres long . The first panel lay 700mm from the 
 
wall,  but  of  that  700mm,  300mm  was  covered  by  felt  forming  part  of  the 
covering of the angle between wall and roof. The panels’  bottom edge lay 2.3 
metres  measured over the roof surface from the valley gutter. A large circular 
vent pipe was situated about  2 metres from the wall, rising vertically through 
the  second  fibreglass  panel  along  on  Side  A.  The  other  end  of  this  15  metre 
section was abutted by the new trapezoidal roofing, with a space of at least 2 
metres before the first rooflight.  

 

6
--------
17.	  The metal and fibreglass panels needed repairs from time to time, and there is 
evidence  of  holes  where  leaks  occurred  down  into  the  works  below  through 
small  holes  being  patched  with  strips  of tape.  There  is  also  evidence  that  the 
 
flashing was in need of repair. Access to the roof, for whatever purpose, was 
gained by a door from the press shop which led via a roof valley along to the 
return  gable  end,  where  it  met  the  valley  running  below  Side  A.  The  valley 
gutter running along Section A was 280 mm, against a recognised standard of 
600mm.  The  narrowness  was  compounded  by  the  fact  that  the  roof  on  the 
opposite side (the new section) protruded out over the edge at a higher level, 
reducing  the  effective  width  of  the  gutter.  The  unchallenged  photographic 
evidence  called  by  the  Crown  also  shows  that  at  the  point  where  the  gutter 
passes  below  the  new  section  of  roofing  below  Section  A,  the  new  roofing 
projects across the gutter, almost entirely covering it, from the point where the 
older section finishes. 

 

18.	  At one point the prosecution seemed to be suggesting that the fact that the roof 
needed  repair  or  patching,  or  that  tape  was  used,  was  somehow  a  matter  for 
criticism. However its expert Mr James made no criticism on that ground. The 
significance of the fact that the roof had leaks, or that parts needed repairs or 
 
patching is restricted to one, but one important issue, which is that the fact that 
the roof needed attention from time to time. This case is emphatically not about 
standards of building maintenance;  it is about whether the method of carrying it 
out was causative of Mr Berry’s death, and the criminal responsibility attaching 
to the company  for that death occurring. 

 

19.	  Mr Berry had made his way on to the roof of part of a building at the Lion Steel 
Equipment Limited premises at Hyde on 29th May 2008. He did so in the course 
of his work, and there is evidence that he did so because there were leaks of 
water into the building below. There is also evidence that the director who was 
works  manager  knew  of  him  doing  that  job  that  day.  His  exact  route  is  not 
known,  and  the  location  of  the  part  of  the  roof  he  was  to  visit  has  not  been 
exactly described in evidence adduced by the Crown, but he had certainly made 
 
his way from the press shop along to the area I have referred to where Section A 
abuts the valley. While he was on the roof, he fell 13 metres to the floor below, 
suffering fatal injuries. There is evidence that while his weight was upon it, a 
fibreglass rooflight became detached from some of its fixings, twisted, and he 

 

7

fell  through  the  gap  thereby  created.  The  panel  in  question  lay  between  the 
gable wall and the vent pipe. It is in issue whether he came to that panel having 
walked up the roof from the valley alongside the gable wall or up the roof slope 
further from it, or whether he had walked along the valley to the new part, gone 
up and over it, and had then walked back at the foot of Side B to do a repair, 
before coming back to the valley below Side A by taking a short cut over the 
ridge. 

20.	  The prosecution evidence from their expert Mr James was that  

 

 

(a)	  The  older  section  of  metal  roof  should  have  been  assumed  to  be  fragile 
unless a test (which could be on one panel)  had shown that it was not. 
(“Fragile”  in  this  context  includes  something  which  could  give  way  as 
 
well as something which is fragile in the usual sense of that word). There 
is no evidence that any part of the metal roof failed; 

 
 

(b)	  The rooflights should have been treated as fragile in any event; 
(c)	  No-one should have been permitted to work on that section of ridged roof 
without  adequate  precautions  being  taken  which  would  include  as  a 
minimum boards to lay over areas where he would be walking or standing, 
and the use of a line and safety harness, so that any fall would be arrested; 
It was not safe to walk or be working within 2 metres of a fragile area. It 
follows that it was unsafe to walk on the roof light, or to walk between it 
and  the  rooflight,  unless  protective  measures  were  taken,  including  the 
wearing of a harness to arrest a fall; 

 
(d)	 

 

 
 

(e)	  The valleys were themselves too narrow; 
(f)	  At  the  time  of  the  accident  no  boards  or  guards  existed  alongside  the 
gutter to discourage persons leaving it to walk on the older section of roof; 
 
(g)	  While  he  accepted  that  a  route  along  the  valley,  and  up  over  the  new 
 
section would be a safe route to adopt to gain access to the other side, he 
said  that  there  is  always  a  danger  in  a  workman  working  on  his  own 
 
wandering  away  from  the  designated  route,  and  especially  so  given  the 
obstructions described already. On the prosecution evidence that must be 
compounded if the valley is unguarded or other measures not adopted to 
prevent or deter access (including the use of this part of the roof as a short 
cut to get back to the valley near the gable corner). There were no warning 
notices, nor any barriers erected alongside the gutter to discourage access

(for example of the type shown in Figure 14 and described in paragraph 67 
of “ Health and Safety in Roof Work” HSG 33 published in 1998); 

(h)	  A workman doing work on a roof must be properly trained, as must his 

 

supervisor. 

 

 
23.	 

 
24.	 

 
22.	 

21.	  The evidence is, and I find, that Mr Berry was not trained as a roofer. He was if 
anything a general maintenance man. He and another man, Mr Baines (who was 
not called as a witness) would do small repairs. If they were in any doubt about 
their  ability  to  carry  them  out,  they  were  instructed  to  ask  for  independent 
outside contractors to attend. The prosecution has called a great deal of evidence 
that someone doing such work required proper training, and that only a properly 
trained  man  should  be  on  a  roof  on  his  own.  The  fact  that  Mr  Berry,  in  the 
course of his employment, was up on the roof on his own, with no protective 
 
equipment, and with no measures taken to guard against falls showed that the 
system adopted for dealing with repairs was inadequate. 
In  my  judgement  the  risk  of  a  fall  through  the  roof  was  an  obvious  one,  and 
those running the company should have appreciated it. There is also abundant 
evidence that relevant HSE guidance and codes of practice warns of the danger 
of fragile roofs, and emphasises the need for proper supervision and training. 
There is evidence that Lion Steel had been warned by an HSE Inspector in 2006 
that warning notices should be erected to keep persons away from fragile roofs. 
That  knowledge  was  with  the  company’s  senior  management  when  the  2007 
Act came into force. 
I accept that the company had devised a way of working, intended to keep Mr 
 
Berry  and  others  off  the  fragile  areas.  Mr  James  accepted  that  such  a  system 
could be proper. But what the company did not do is to train Mr Berry properly, 
 
or  to  equip  him  or  others  with  equipment,  in  the  form  of  a  harness  and  line, 
 
which would protect him should an accident occur. The absence of boards, or 
barriers defining routes, meant that there was nothing to dissuade a workman 
from  taking  a  short  cut,  when  any  deficiency  in  the  roof  would  cause  him  to 
plunge 13 metres to the floor below. 
 
If that was not in focus already as the result of the various codes of practice and 
guidance documents, it became crystal clear as the result of the passage of the 
2005 Regulations. Effectively, the system involved the untrained and inexpert

--------
Mr Berry being asked to work on and around a fragile roof with no precautions 
being taken to guard against something going wrong, or him taking a short cut.  
 
25.	  The Prosecution spent a great deal of time at trial, and have spent some again 
today, arguing that the company’s insurance brokers and insurers warned it of 
 
the need for proper risk assessments, and that this was causative of the accident. 
All of this material relates to events occurring before the commencement date of 
the  Act,  and  therefore  if  it  is  material  now,  it  is  so  only  to  the  question  of 
whether a breach after 1st April 2008 was gross. But even if that were not the 
 
case, so far as the merits are concerned, I dealt at length with this aspect of the 
 
Crown’s arguments in my ruling at the close of the prosecution case.  I regard 
some of the Crown’s case as unrealistic. I say that for these reasons 
 
(a)	 

It was clearly established at the trial that the insurer’s requirements for risk 
assessments relating to roof work did not require a written assessment 

 

 

 

(b)	  No  insurer  ever  refused  cover  on  the  ground  that  the  precautions  for 
working  on  the  roof  at  Hyde  were  inadequate.  I  shall  quote  part  of  my 
ruling 

“Indeed one should note Mrs Barton’s visits to Hyde in February 2005 
 
and April 2007. Her evidence (which was based on her notes made for 
internal  AXA  use)  said  nothing  about  any  issue  relating  to  roofs  at 
Hyde,  except  that  in  2007  she  noted  that  large  parts  of  the  roof  had 
been replaced.  

Her evidence showed also that the general health and safety situation at 
Hyde had improved substantially between 2002 and 2007. In 2007 she 
described  the  overall  situation  as    “acceptable  subject  to  risk 
requirements  being  completed  within  appropriate  timescales.”  None 
related to roof work. There was no point at which AXA ever refused to 
insure the premises.” 

 
(c)	 

In my judgement, the insurers and insurance brokers were also less than 
thorough in their assessments about the roof.  The only point on what the 
 
insurance brokers, insurers and risk assessors advised is that the company 
should  have  been  aware  of  the  need  for  training,  and  for  a  proper 
assessment of risk, including the risk of working at heights. That proper 
assessment  would  have  applied  and  considered  HSE  and  other  relevant 
guidance. But what is absent in this case is anyone saying that the system 
for dealing with the roof at Hyde was inadequate, or that it was an obvious 

 

10
--------
26.	 

 
27.	 

 
28.	 

source of danger. Indeed at the trial, it was established that no-one from 
any of those bodies ever even drew attention to it. The highest the case can 
be put on warnings is that Mr Norton of the HSE said that there should be 
notices warning of fragile roofs. He also gave no warning that men should 
not work on the roof. 

 
I also rejected (and do so now) the Crown’s case on the relevance of what was 
happening at Chester, save in one respect. I accept that the Chester experience 
showed that Lion Steel had experience of properly conducted risk assessments 
 
and of having health and safety advice. But as was established beyond argument 
at trial, the assessments for working at height at Chester had nothing to do with 
roofs, but only with working internally on platforms or ladders. It is a source of 
concern to me that the Crown have continued to argue as they have.  
I do not consider that any blame attaches to Mr Berry. He was getting on with 
his  work,  and  met  his  death  when  he  took  just  the  sort  of  chance  which  the 
advice and regulations are designed to protect against. 
It follows that while there was a gross breach of duty by the company, it is that 
this company, while doing something to deal with the obvious risks, did far less 
 
than  was  required.  That  is  what  transpired  from  Mr  James’  evidence  in  the 
witness box, which I accept.  But what I do not accept is that it did so in the 
knowledge  that  its  insurers  and  others  were  arguing  that  it  should  adopt  a 
different system for the repair of roofs at Hyde.  

The Guideline 

 
29.	 

 
30.	 

I  refer  to  the  definitive  guideline  published  by  the  Sentencing  Guidelines 
Council in February 2010. By section 125 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, 
this court must, in sentencing the Defendant, follow any sentencing guidelines 
which  are  relevant  to  the    case.  unless  the  court  is  satisfied  that  it  would  be 
contrary to the interests of justice to do so. 
I shall refer in particular to sections B (factors likely to affect seriousness), C 
(Financial  information)  ,  D  (level  of  Fine)  F  (costs),  before  considering  the 
effect of the plea of guilty. 

 

 

Applying the tests  of seriousness  in the  definitive guideline 

 

11
--------
(b)	 

 
31.	  By definition (see paragraph 5) the level of harm is serious, because a death was 
caused.  But  beyond  that  there  is  a  wide  range  of  factors  assessing  the 
seriousness of the offence (paragraph 6). I take them in turn 
(a)	  Foreseeability.  Given  the  fact  that  any  accident  on  a  fragile  roof  would 
expose a workman to falling 13 metres, the risk of serious injury or death 
was obvious; 
If I apply Mr James’ evidence in the witness box, the company fell short 
of the required standard, but had done something to address the risk, albeit 
not nearly enough. The measures required to address it (training, boards, 
barriers and a harness or line) would not have been expensive to install; 
 
The  standards  of  safety  were  generally  reasonable  at  the  time  of  the 
 
accident, as the AXA report showed.. However I accept that at the Hyde 
works, there was less attention to the requirements of risk assessment and 
training generally than at Chester; 

 
(c)	 

 

(d)	  The responsibilities for the breach lie at the door of the director in charge 
 
of  the  Hyde  works.  Having  heard  evidence  at  the  trial  on  this  issue,  I 
regard  the  other  directors  as  bearing  no  or  little  responsibility  for  the 
failure to set up a proper system at Hyde. 

 

 
33.	 

32.	  As to the factors in paragraph 7- aggravating factors- I find those I have already 
identified, but no others. I should make it plain that I regard the failures by the 
company as serious, and that much of the prosecutions case on dealings with 
others  added  nothing  to  it.  Indeed  if  anything  it  served  to  cloud  a  very 
straightforward issue. 
 
I  turn  now  to  mitigating  factors,  as  set  out  at  paragraph  8.  Lion  Steel  has  a 
 
reasonable Health and Safety record. Since the accident happened it has stopped 
 
using its own workmen for roof repairs. It had shown in the past that it would 
take  advice  on  health  and  safety,  by  the  use  of  advisers  at  Chester,  and  the 
obtaining of advice from the risk assessment arm of its brokers. It could have 
done more, and had similar advice at Hyde. 
I must also note the delays in bringing this case to court. It is now over 4 years 
since  Mr  Berry  died.  Although  the  last  12  months’  delay  was  caused  by  the 
search  for  a  date  for  the  trial  convenient  to  all  parties,  most  of  the  previous 
delay was caused by the failure of the prosecuting authorities to act promptly. It 
took  over  three  years  for  any  charges  to  be  brought,  a  delay  which  I  find 

 
34.	 

 

12
--------
unreasonable,  and  especially  so  when  at  that  stage  individuals  were  facing 
prosecution. It is relevant, but less so, in the case of a corporate Defendant. It is 
 
a  matter  which  does  not  mitigate  the  level  of  fine,  but  may  be  relevant  to 
questions of costs. 

Financial position of the company 

 
35.	 

I turn now to the financial position of the company (paragraphs 12- 21). I have 
 
been provided with 3 years’ accounts, and with an expert accountant’s report.  

 

36.	  The company manufactures lockers at its two sites in Hyde and Chester . In its 
 
current form it was set up in 1998 as a management buyout to prevent closure of 
the  company  and  the  loss  of  150  jobs.  It  has  142  employees.  Over  the  three 
years from 1st October 2008 to 30th September 2011 its turnover has been of the 
order of £ 10 million per annum, with a profit before tax of between £187,000 to 
 
£317,000. Its directors have been paid a total of £336,000 in each of the last two 
years, with the highest figure being £ 88,000. It follows that this is not a case of 
a company where the directors are creaming off large salaries.  
Its  cash  flow  analysis  shows  that  cash  generated  by  the  company  is  used  for 
payment of loan interest, payment of taxes, ongoing capital expenditure, lease 
payments, and repayment of loans. No dividends have been paid to shareholders 
in the last three years. 

 
37.	 

 

38.	  The  balance  sheets  have  also  been  produced.  As  one  would  expect  the  only 
substantial asset relates to the land and buildings, and the equipment, which are 
used  to  secure  bank  loans.  The  total  value  in  the  books  is  given  as  £  1.67 
million. A loan already exists on the Hyde premises. It was for £ 1 million, but 
after  repayments  has  now  been  reduced  to  £  283,000.    I  accept  that  in  the 
current  climate  older  factory  buildings  (as  the  Hyde  works  is)  do  not  have  a 
ready market, and that the machinery cannot be sold without risking the future 
of the business. The company also has its goodwill as an asset. It is of course of 
 
the nature of goodwill that it only retains that value if a business is sold as a 
going concern. Otherwise the company raises loans against the value of its trade 
 
debts to provide working capital. 
In terms of its future business, reductions in public expenditure generally, and 
 
on  schools  in  particular,  may  affect  its  ability  to  sustain  its  current  turnover. 

 
39.	 

 

 

13
--------
40.	 

There  are  also  commercial  rivals  here  and  in  other  parts  of  the  world  who 
 
provide stiff competition. 
It  follows  from  the  above  that  this  is  a  company  which  is  holding  its  own 
financially, but as one would expect has to rely on loans and cashflow to keep 
going. It is also quite apparent from the material put before me that this is not a 
company which has engaged in extravagance. 

 

 
42.	 

 
41.	  The  accountant’s  report  provides  very  helpful  information  on  how  any  fine 
could be paid. If a substantial fine were imposed with a short payment period, it 
 
would have a potentially severe impact on the company’s ability to sustain itself 
in business. 
I am very mindful of the 142 people who work at Lion Steel. I would regard it 
as  a  most  regrettable  consequence,  which  would  add 
terrible 
 
consequences of Mr Berry’s death, if the effect of  an order of this court were to 
imperil  the  employment  of  his  former  colleagues  and  those  who  would  have 
been had he lived. The Guideline refers to a fine of less than £ 500,000 seldom 
being appropriate after a trial. The accountant’s report has satisfied me that a 
fine  of  over  £  100,000,  if  ordered  to  be  paid  in  a  short  period,  could  have  a 
serious  effect  on  the  ability  of  the  company  to  pay  its  way  and  sustain  its 
business. 

to 

the 

 

43.	  On  the  other  hand,  the  commission  of  this  offence  requires  significant 
punishment, and I am quite satisfied that, with a longer payment period, that a 
loan can be raised on the buildings. 

Timeliness of the plea of guilty 

 

44.	  The plea came before the trial of Lion Steel for corporate manslaughter was due 
to  start.  I  am  told  that  a  plea  had  been  offered  in  April  2012,  but  in  fact  the 
company had denied the lesser charge at trial. The offer of a plea was on the 
 
basis that the charges against the directors would not be proceeded with. It  was 
refused because the Crown wished to pursue the directors as well 

 

45.	  The acceptability of the plea to the Crown altered after its main case against the 
directors had encountered real difficulty at trial. I have already commented on 
the view I take of the Crown’s approach to the liability of two of the individual 

 

14
--------
directors. On the other hand, Lion Steel could have entered this plea a long time 
before. 

46.	  Taking  all  those  matters  into  account,  I  consider  that  the  fine  should  be 

 

mitigated by a figure of 20% from that which would have obtained after trial. 

Level of Fine 
 

 
47.	 

 
 
 
 

I have had regard to section D of the guideline. Having regard to the seriousness 
 
of the breach, but also to the other matters to which I have drawn attention, and 
to  the  company’s  financial  position,  I  consider  that  the  appropriate  fine,  after 
allowing 20% discount, is one of £ 480,000. It is to be paid in instalments as 
follows 
(a)	  By 30th September 2012 
(b)	  By 30th September  2013 
(c)	  By 30th September 2014 
(d)	  By  30th September 2015 

£ 100,000 
£ 150,000 
£ 150,000. 
£  80,000 

 
 
 
 

Other Orders 

 
48.	 

I  make  no  order  as  to  compensation.  I  am  satisfied  that  the  compensation  to 
which  Mr  Berry’s  estate  and  dependants  must  be  entitled  can  be  dealt  with 
through the civil process. 

49.	  A publicity order  was not asked for. It would achieve nothing which will not be 

 

achieved by the reporting of these sentencing remarks. 

50.	  No remedial order was sought. I am satisfied that all necessary remedial steps 

 

have been taken. 

51.	  There will be a victim surcharge of £ 15. 

 

 

Costs 

 

52.	  The Crown has claimed £ 163,857 in costs, made up as to £127,640 CPS costs 
(including  counsel’s fees), and £ 36,217 HSE investigation costs. Of those the 
figures incurred before April 2012 were £ 103,000 and £ 17,000 respectively, 
plus some part of counsel’s fees (which total £ 74,274.19) 

 

15
--------
(c)	 

53.	  Mr Turner QC asked me to make no order as to costs, or to attribute no more 
than 25% of the costs to the case against Lion Steel. I reject that approach. I 
shall adopt a broad brush approach which reflects the facts that  
 
(a)	  most of the preparation of the case would have been undertaken anyway 
 
(b)	 

the time spent in preparation over 3 years was excessive, and some of the 
 
case presented was unnecessary and irrelevant 
the  fact  is  that  the  Crown  has  now  effectively  conceded  that  the  offer 
made to it in April should have been accepted. 

 
54.	 

I shall therefore order that Lion Steel pay the Crown 60% of its costs incurred 
until April 2012. If I treat the total figure as £ 140,000 (so some counsel’s fees 
are included) the result is an order for £ 84,000. That figure must be paid within 
2 years of today’s date.

This is a ruling following a preparatory hearing, held pursuant to section 31 of 
 
the  Criminal  Procedure  and  Investigations  Act  1996,  and    Rule  15.1  of  the 
Criminal Procedure Rules.. The trial of the Defendants on this indictment is 
listed to start on  12th June 2012. This preparatory hearing has been ordered by 
consent, because the issues raised by the First Defendant about the first count 
raise questions relating to the law relating to the case, to the admissibility of 
evidence,  and  to  questions  of  severance.  Some  additional  matters  have  also 
 
been  raised  (listed  below).  I  have  been  assisted  by  skeleton  arguments 
provided by both Prosecution and First Defendant, albeit that I did not receive 
them  until  3rd  May  (and  4th  May  in  respect  of  some  supplementary 
submissions).  

In this case, the four Defendants face various charges arising out of the tragic 
death of Steven Berry on 29th May 2008 at the factory premises in Dukinfield 
of the First Defendant Lion Steel Equipment Limited (” LSEL”). Mr Berry, 
 
who was an employee of the company, fell some 40 feet to his death through a 
skylight in a roof, on to which roof he had gone to repair a leak. 

 
3.	 

The indictment alleges the following 

 
i)	 

Count 1; corporate manslaughter against LSEL. It alleges that on 29th 
 
May 2008, the Defendant LSEL “ ……being an organisation, namely a 
 

 

17
--------
corporation,  and  because  of  the  way  in  which  the  organisations’ 
activities were managed or organised by its senior management, caused 
the death of…..Steven Berry by failing to ensure that a safe system of 
work was in place in respect  of work undertaken at roof height, which 
failure amounted to a gross breach of a relevant duty of care owed by 
it, to the deceased.” 

Count 2 alleges manslaughter against three directors of the Defendant 
LSEL,  Mr  Palliser,  Mr  Williams,  and  Mr  Coupe.  It  is  the  Crown’s 
 
contention  that  each  was  under  a  personal  duty  of  care  towards  the 
company’s employee Mr Berry, and that he died as the result of what 
the Crown say was their gross negligence, or to put it another way, the 
gross breach of the duty of care the Crown asserts was owed by them 
as directors to him as an employee. 

Count  3  alleges  that  LSEL  failed  to  discharge  a  duty  pursuant  to 
section 2 of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 (“ HSWA”). It is 
alleged that as Mr Berry’s employer, it failed to ensure so far as was 
 
reasonably practicable the safety of employees working at height.  

Count  4  alleges  that  the  Second,  Third  and  Fourth  Defendants 
committed the offence of neglect, contrary to section 37 of HSWA. It 
is alleged that the failure by LSEL in Count 3 was attributable to their 
neglect. 

Count  5  alleges  against  LSEL  that  there  was  a  contravention  of  the 
 
Work at Height Regulations 2005 (and therefore an offence is alleged 
 
under  section  33  of  HSWA)  because  no  suitable  and  sufficient 
measures were taken to prevent, so far as was reasonably practicable, 
persons falling a distance likely to cause injury. 

 
ii)	 

 
iii)	 

 
iv)	 

 
v)	 

 
4.	 

The following arguments were addressed to me by Mr Turner QC on behalf of 
LSEL 

 
i)	 

 
ii)	 

 
iii)	 

 
iv)	 

In  the  light  of  how  the  Crown  puts  its  case,  Count  1  could  not  be 
proceeded with, and should be stayed or severed 
 

If  the  Crown  wished  to  proceed  with  an  allegation  of  manslaughter 
against  LSEL,  it  could  only  do  so  by  means  of  an  allegation  of 
manslaughter at common law 

Count 5 was unnecessary, and added nothing to Count 3. In addition it 
contained  no  adequate  allegation  because  it  did  not  specify  the 
Regulation whose breach was alleged 

In any event, proper case management required that the advocate for 
LSEL  should  cross  examine  after  the  advocates  for  the  other 
Defendants, and should present its case last.

The Crown, through Mr Jackson QC, resists arguments (i) and (iii). In the case 
of  (ii)  while  he  accepts  that  it  could  have  been  charged,  he  defends  the 
Crown’s use of the statutory charge of corporate manslaughter.  

The  starting  point  for  consideration  of  the  arguments  about  Count  1  is  the 
effect of the the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007 
(CMCHA). It came into force on 6th April 2008, shortly before the tragic death 
of  Mr  Berry,  and  the  Crown  contend  that  there  was  a  considerable  history 
before the commencement date of the company and the three named directors 

 
i)	 

 
ii)	 

failing to implement a safe system of working in respect of working on 
the roof, both generally, and with specific regard to Mr Berry, who, it 
is alleged, was not trained in working on  roofs; 

failed  over  a  number  of  years  to  act  on  warnings  given  to  them  by 
others  dealing  with  their  insurance,  or  with  health  and  safety  advice, 
that their system of working was deficient. 

A matter vigorously debated before me was the degree to which the history of 
dealings by the company and its directors before the date of commencement 
 
could  be  relied  on  when  considering  events  after  that  date.  It  is  therefore 
necessary  to  start  with  the  law  as  it  stood  before  the  commencement  of  the 
Act. 
A  company  could  commit 
the  offence  of  manslaughter  by  gross 
negligence. To  be  guilty  of  the  common  law  offence  of  gross  negligence 
manslaughter, there must have been a gross breach of a duty of care owed to 
the  victim.    Before  a  company  could  be  convicted  of  manslaughter,  a 
 
""directing mind"" of the organisation (that is, a senior individual who can be 
said to embody the company in his actions and decisions) had to be shown to 
be  guilty  of  the  offence.  It  follows  that  for  liability  for  manslaughter  to  be 
established, the Crown had to prove that 

 

 
i)	 

 
ii)	 

There was a death, and 

That  death  was  caused  by  the  gross  negligence  of  a  directing  mind 
within the company. 

CMCHA was enacted because of the problems that could occur in identifying 
 
a person who was the directing mind, whose conduct or omissions could be 
treated as grossly negligent. 
Section  1(1)  and  (6)  of  CMCHA 
manslaughter as follows 

defines  the  offence  of  corporate 

“An organisation to which this section applies is guilty of an offence if the 
way in which its activities are managed or organised—  
(a) causes a person's death, and  
(b)amounts to a gross breach of a relevant duty of care owed by the 
 

organisation to the deceased.” 

 
11.	 

Section 1(3) and (4) state that

The  Crown’s  case  against  LSEL  has  always  been  that  the  three  named 
directors and co-Defendants were the “senior management” of the company of 
the purposes of section 1(3) and (4) of the CMCHA. It follows that the Crown 
alleges that the gross breaches of the duty of care owed by the three men was a 
 
substantial element in the gross breach of the relevant duty of care for which 
the Crown contends. 

 

The Crown has served particulars of the alleged offence under Count 1.  It can 
be summarised thus: over a period of some years, the Company and its senior 
 
managers had been on notice that its system for dealing with work on the roof 
 
at  Dukinfield  was  inadequate,  if  it  existed  at  all,  and  that  the  roof  required 
inspection, and that they failed to act on warnings which they had been given. 
The Crown’s case is also that Mr Berry had had no adequate training, and was 
 
not a roofer by qualification or experience. For the purposes of this ruling, I 
shall  assume  that  that  case  is  made  out,  and  that  the  senior  managers 
concerned were each on notice. It contends that the duty on the company and 
on its  directors to take reasonable care for the safety of its employees, and of 
Mr Berry, was a continuing one, and that the failures to take the appropriate 
measures amounted to gross breaches.  

 
17.	 

The argument advanced by LSEL on Count 1 is, in summary, that 

 
i)	 

 
ii)	 

 
iii)	 

 
iv)	 

The Crown’s case relies on acts and omissions in the management and 
organisation  of  the  company’s  activities,  including  breaches  of  duty, 
taking  place  before  6th  April  2008,  which  is  the  date  when  CMCHA 
came into force; 

 
By virtue of sections 20 and 27(3), (4) and (5) the prosecution of an 
offence  under  CMCHA  does  not  permit  the  Crown  to  ask  the  Court, 
when  addressing  whether  the  ingredients  of  the  offence  have  been 
established, 
to  look  to  acts  or  omissions  which  occurred  before  the 
date of commencement; 

The  Crown’s  case,  however  it  is  dressed  up,  actually  involves 
examination  of  the  three  named  directors’  conduct  over  the  years 
before commencement; 

 
That therefore the count is wrong in law or  must be stayed or must be 
severed. 

 

21
--------
18.	 

 
19.	 

 
The Crown contends, in summary, that while the Crown will call evidence of 
failures in management and gross breaches of duty which occurred before the 
commencement date, it bases its case on Count 1 on what occurred or did not 
occur after 6th April 2008. In a nutshell it says that the duty of care existed 
 
before  and  after  the  commencement  date,  and  that  what  had  been  a  gross 
breach  by  omission  continued  thereafter.  It  contends  that  in  considering 
 
whether the duty was complied with after 6th April 2008, and in considering 
whether any breach of it was gross, it is entitled to call evidence of the history 
before  the  commencement  date,  and  to  refer  to  the  length  of  time  that  had 
elapsed  since  matters  were  first  brought  to  the  company’s  and  managers’ 
attention. 

Before turning to the nuts and bolts of that argument, it is right to observe that 
no-one appears to have addressed it as an issue until Mr Mark Turner QC was 
instructed,  and  raised  it  at  the  hearing  on  24th  February  2012.  There  is  no 
 
doubt in my mind, having read the particulars supplied by the Crown before 
that date, in its further particulars ordered to be filed thereafter, and in its case 
summaries, that it was approaching this case on the basis that, in the context of 
 
Count 1, as well as Counts 2-5,  it could rely on any evidence of what occurred 
beforehand in terms of management failures.  

 
20.	 

In my judgement, the following issues arise 

 
i)	 

 
ii)	 

What are the ingredients of the offence of corporate manslaughter ? 
 

To what extent can the jury consider evidence of what occurred before 
the  commencement  date,  when  addressing  the  “management  or 
 
organisation of its activities” by LSEL ? 
 

iii)	  What  are  the  sources  of  evidence  of  past  relevant  activities  or  gross 
 

 

breaches? 

 

iv)	  What  will  the  effect  be  of  Count  1  being  tried  alongside  Count  2, 
where evidence of earlier activities is undoubtedly admissible against 
the three directors ? 

 
v)	 

If it discloses an offence known to law, should the count be severed ? 
 

  
(1)	 
 
? 

What are the ingredients of the offence of corporate manslaughter 

 
21.	 

In my judgement the Crown has to prove the following 

 
i)	 

 
ii)	 

 
iii)	 

That LSEL is an organisation 

That  the  way  in  which  the  activities  of  LSEL  were  managed  or 
organised caused the death 

 
That  LSEL  owed  a  duty  at  common  law  to  take  reasonable  care  to 
provide a safe system of working to its employee Mr Berry 

 

22
--------
iv)	 

 
v)	 

 
vi)	 

 
vii)	 

That Mr Berry’s death was caused by a failure within the scope of the 
management and organisation of the activities of LSEL to perform that 
duty 

That the breach of duty amounted to a gross breach of that duty of care, 
because the conduct alleged to constitute a failure  fell far below what 
could reasonably be expected of LSEL in the circumstances 

That the way in which its activities were managed or organised by its 
senior management is a substantial element in the gross breach alleged. 

It  is  to  be  noted  that  it  would  not  have  been  possible  to  charge  the 
Second, Third or Fourth Defendants with any offence related to Count 
 
1. By section 18 

“an  individual  cannot  be  guilty  of  aiding,  abetting,  counselling  or 
procuring the commission of an offence of corporate manslaughter.” 

 
22.	 

There can be no doubt that CMCHA created a new offence. The offence has 
three fundamental elements 

 
i)	 

 
ii)	 

 
iii)	 

The death must have been caused by the way in which the its activities 
were managed or organised 

The death was caused by a gross breach of the common law duty of 
care imposed by the law of negligence on LSEL 

That gross breach was attributable wholly or substantially to the way in 
which  its  activities  were  managed  or  organised  by  its  senior 
management. 

Can  the  prosecution  rely  on  evidence  of  what  occurred  before  the 
commencement  date  in  support  of  its  case?   In  other  words,  are  conduct  or 
omissions  forming  part  of  the  relevant  “  way  in  activities  were  managed  or 
organised”  so  as  to  give  rise  to  the  gross  breach  of  common  law  duty,  but 
which  occurred  before  the  commencement  date,  capable  of  forming  the 
subject matter of prosecution ? 
  

One  starts  with  general  principle.  A  statute  cannot  render  conduct  unlawful 
 
retrospectively in the absence of clear words : Phillips v Eyre [1870] LR 6 QB 
1 per Willes J and Yew Bon Tew v Kenderaan Bas Mara [1983] 1 AC 553 @ 
558 per Lord Brightman.   

 

 

This statute is dealing, among other situations,  with the kind of case where 
omissions or conduct in the activities of senior management within a company 
over a period of time can create a set of circumstances in which the risk of 
 
accidental  injury  is  increased.  If  death  is  caused  as  a  result,  then  a  criminal 
 
offence is committed.  It follows that the law has the effect of rendering liable 
 
to  criminal  penalty  conduct  or  omissions  which  were  not  the  subject  of 
criminal penalty before it came into force.

28.	 

The  situation  before  6th  April  2008  was  different.  LSEL  was  subject  to 
 
criminal penalty  if it committed the common law offence of manslaughter by 
gross  negligence.  It  is  of  course  common  knowledge  that  prosecutions  of 
companies  for  that  offence  were  rarely  brought,  and  succeeded  even  more 
rarely, because of the requirement that it had to be shown that the controlling 
mind  of  the  company  had  been  grossly  negligent.    It  is  significant  in  my 
judgement that the effect of the CMCHA is not a procedural or evidential one 
 
of introducing different rules on what evidence may be admitted to show what 
 
formed the controlling mind, but one of actually introducing a new substantive 
 
offence. 

 

It  follows  in  my  judgement  that  the  Crown  cannot  look  to  evidence  of 
“activities” or whether they involved a “breach” or a “ gross breach,” where 
such  activities,  breach  or  gross  breach  occurred  before  the  date  of 
commencement,  save insofar as they are relevant to the existence of a duty on 
and after that date, or whether a breach after that date was a “gross breach.” 
 

That interpretation, which I have arrived at after my own analysis, assisted by 
the submissions of counsel, is supported by academic opinion (see Ferguson at 
S.L.T [2007] 35 @ 251-260), and by the explanatory notes to the 2007 Act, 
and by the Health and Safety Executive. 

 
29.	 

Explanatory Note 66 to the statute refers to section 27(3) 

“Subsection  (3)  makes  it  clear  that  the  legislation  is  not  retrospective. 
 
Subsection  (4)  makes  provision  for  the  common  law  offence  of 
manslaughter  by  gross  negligence  to  remain  in  place  in  respect  to 
corporations  for  conduct  and  events  that  occur  prior  to  commencement. 
Proceedings in respect of the common law offence (whether started before 
or  after  the  new  offence  is  brought  into  force)  and  arising  out  of  the 
conduct and events occurring prior to commencement will not be affected 
 
by the Act.”

in 

its 

“Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007 
 

14. On  6th  April  2008  the  Corporate  Manslaughter  and  Corporate 
Homicide Act 2007 came into force throughout the UK and created a new 
statutory  offence.  In  England  and  Wales  and  Northern  Ireland,  the  new 
offence is called corporate manslaughter (CM), and in Scotland it is called 
corporate homicide (CH).  

15. Where any of the conduct or events alleged to constitute the offence 
occurred  before  6  April,  the  pre-existing  common  law  will  apply. 
Therefore, the Act will only apply to deaths where the conduct or harm, 
leading to the death, occurs on or after 6 April. 
 

 

24
--------
16. CM/CH is investigated by the police and prosecutions are determined, 
and  taken,  by  CPS. In  England  and  Wales  proceedings  may  not  be 
instituted without the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  

 
17. The new offence is intended to work in conjunction with other forms 
of accountability such as gross negligent manslaughter for individuals and 
breaches  of  duties  owed  under  the  Health  and  Safety  at  Work  Act  and 
 
 
relevant  statutory  provisions.  Consequently  an  organisation  facing  a 
charge of corporate manslaughter may, in relation to the same fatality and 
at the same time, also face a charge or charges of breaching the Health 
 
and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974.   

18. A corporate body, such as a company, is a legal ‘person’ and can be 
 
prosecuted  for  a  wide  range  of  criminal  offences.   Until  the  corporate 
manslaughter/homicide  Act  came  into  force,  this  included  manslaughter 
by  gross  negligence. To  be  guilty  of  the  common  law  offence  of  gross 
negligence manslaughter, there must have been a gross breach of a duty of 
care owed to the victim.   Before a company could have been convicted of 
manslaughter,  a  ""directing  mind""  of  the  organisation  (that  is,  a  senior 
 
individual  who  can  be  said  to  embody  the  company  in  his  actions  and 
decisions)  must  also  be  guilty  of  the  offence.  This  is  known  as  the 
“identification  principle”,  and 
it  extremely  difficult  for 
 
organisations,  other  than  the  very  small  ones,  to  be  prosecuted  for 
manslaughter.   

it  made 

 

19. The  government  was  therefore  minded  to  update  the  law  on 
manslaughter as it relates to corporations, and to bring in legislation that 
overcomes  the  problems  created  by  the  identification  principle. This 
 
places responsibility on the working practices of the organisation, as set 
by senior management, rather than limiting investigations to questions of 
 
individual  gross  negligence  by  company  bosses. The  new  law  therefore 
 
removes  the  need  to  identify  the  ‘controlling  or  directing  mind’  of  the 
company, which is intended to make it easier to prosecute a company, or 
 
other  employing  organisation,  for  a  corporate  manslaughter/homicide 
 
offence.” 

 

(2) To  what  extent  can  the  jury  consider  evidence  of  what  occurred  before 
the  commencement  date,  when  addressing  the  “management  or 
 
organisation of its activities” by LSEL ? 
 

 
31.	 

Given my conclusion that the CMCHA is not of retrospective effect, and that 
 
what occurred before commencement cannot form activities for the purposes 
of the offence created by section 1, one must then consider whether evidence 
of such pre-commencement activities is admissible in a trial of a Defendant for 
the offence created by section 1. 

 

32.	  Mr Turner QC, in a very able argument, submits that the effect of sections 20, 
 
27(3) (4) and (5) is to prevent consideration of pre commencement activities. 
He says that while knowledge held at the commencement date is relevant, the 
court is prevented , when assessing whether a breach has occurred or is gross, 

 

25
--------
from considering  what occurred before commencement . Thus for example, if 
a breach of the duty occurred after the date of commencement, and there was 
evidence that the managers were on notice that their system was inadequate, 
 
and  one  is  considering  whether  it  was  a  gross  breach,  he  says  that  one  is 
prevented  from  considering  whether  the  inadequacy  or  knowledge  of  it  was 
recent or long standing.  

 
33.	 

As a matter of first impression such an argument seems unpersuasive. Leaving 
the  effect  of  sections  20  and  27  aside,  one  can  test  that  by  comparing  two 
examples 

 
i)	 

Suppose  Company  A  has  been  warned  on  1st  April  2004,  and  at  six 
monthly intervals thereafter, that its system for maintaining its heavy 
 
lifting  gear  was  inadequate.  The  last  warning  had  been  on  1st  April 
2008,  6  days  before  the  Act  came  into  force.  On  1st  July  2008  the 
lifting  gear  failed  while  lifting  a  load  as  a  result  of  its  being 
inadequately  maintained,  causing  the  death  of  an  employee  standing 
 
beneath it. 

 
ii)	 

By contrast Company B received a similar warning for the first time on 
1st April 2008, before a similar accident on 1st July 2008. 

 
34.	 

In considering whether the breach by Company A to maintain its heavy lifting 
gear after 6th April 2008 was gross, it would in my judgement be wrong, and 
indeed  entirely  unrealistic,  to  exclude  from  consideration  the  fact  that  the 
 
failure was a long standing one and had been the subject of repeated warnings, 
one as recently as 3 months before the accident.  

 

35.	  Mr Turner contends that the effect of section 27 (3)-(5) prevents that. He says, 
with his usual frankness, that the clock stopped ticking on 5th April 2008, and 
that a new clock started ticking again on 6th April.  On his argument, Company 
A would be in no worse position than Company B if facing a charge under 
section 1. 

 

 
36.	 

 
37.	 

 

It  is  part  of  his  argument  that  pre-commencement  date  activities,  including 
failures to perform its duty of care, can still be relevant if the charge brought is 
one of common law manslaughter by gross negligence. He contends that the 
effect  of  section  27(3)  to  (5)  preserves  liability  for  manslaughter  caused  by 
 
gross negligence before the commencement date, albeit that the death occurred 
afterwards. 

Sections 27(3)-(5) are directed to “any liability, investigation, legal proceeding 
or penalty for or in respect of an offence.” (subs (4). In the context of the issue 
 
being discussed here, the only relevant concept is “ liability.” Subs (5) does 
not  extend  the  meaning  of  subs  (4)  but  seeks  to  define  it.    The  offences 
 
referred to are not specified in the section, but even if “offence” only refers to 
manslaughter, in my judgement in a case such as the present one it only has 
meaning in relation to an offence committed by then. I say that because, while 
a failure to take care by LSEL before 6th April 2008 could have constituted an 
 
offence  under  the  Health  and  Safety  at  Work  Act,  no  liability  for 
manslaughter could exist until the death occurred. It follows in my judgement 
 

26
--------
that no liability for manslaughter at common law could have occurred in this 
case  before  6th  April  2008.  It  follows  that  there  was  nothing  to  be  kept  by 
section  27  as  unaffected  by  the  passage  of  section  20.  Given  the  terms  of 
section  20  (which  abolished  liability  for  the  common  law  offence  of 
manslaughter by gross negligence as from 6th April 2008) no liability on LSEL 
for  common  law  manslaughter  existed  before  that  date,  and  none  could  be 
 
created thereafter. 

I  can  conceive  of  some  factual  situations  where  the  activities  all  occurred 
 
before  the  date  of  commencement,  but  the  death  occurred  afterwards.  If  a 
company  manufactures  and  sells  a  car  with  a  fuel  tank  susceptible  to 
explosion, the gross negligence would occur some time before the death. The 
same could also occur where a hospital permits, in a grossly negligent manner, 
some  poisonous  substance  to  be  ingested  by  a  patient,  which  causes  death 
some  time  later.  Let  us  assume  that  in  both  cases,  the  commencement  date 
intervened.  But  those  are  cases  where  all  the  causative  acts  have  occurred 
before  the  commencement  date.  If  the  result  flowing  from  those  pre 
commencements  acts  or  omissions  is  a  death  after  the  commencement  date, 
 
then  the  potential  liability  to  be  guilty  of  manslaughter  has  already  been 
created.  Even  though  I  am  not  persuaded  that  the  effect  of  the  terms  of 
sections 20 and 27 saves the ability for the car manufacturer or the hospital to 
be charged with gross negligence manslaughter at common law, there is a very 
 
substantial difference between those cases and the present, where the sending 
of Mr Berry up to the roof on the day of his death is an essential part of the 
 
acts/omissions which created the situation which caused his death.  

It is right to say that the Crown seemed to accept that LSEL could have been 
 
charged with an offence at common law. I do not accept the common view of 
the Crown and of LSEL that, in the circumstances of this case, LSEL could be 
prosecuted at common law for a manslaughter where the death only occurred 
after the common law offence had been abolished. (And it should be noted that 
section  20  does  not  just  prevent  prosecution;  it  abolishes  the  offence  in  its 
application to corporations). In my judgement nothing in section 27 enables a 
prosecution to be brought against a company in the circumstances of this case 
for the common law offence of manslaughter by gross negligence, where the 
 
death occurred after the commencement date.  

If that approach be correct, does section 27(3) to (5) prevent the adduction of 
evidence  of  what  happened  before  the  commencement  date  ?   I  do  not 
consider that subsection (3) is concerned with the admissibility of evidence, 
but with the existence of liability, or by its reference to investigation, penalties 
etcetera,  to  clarify  that  an  offence  committed  before  then  can  still  be 
investigated, charged and indicted under the common law.   

Its purpose and effect is to define the date after which the matters described in 
section 1 constitute an offence- i.e whether “the way in which its activities are 
managed or organise causes a person's death” and whether that  amounts to a 
gross  breach  of  a  relevant  duty  of  care  owed  by  the  organisation  to  the 
deceased. It does not seek to prescribe or proscribe the evidence  which may

45.	 

 
be  called  to  prove  that  a  duty  of  care  existed,  nor  whether  any  breach  was 
gross. 

 
I accept (and agree) that section 1 does not bite on activities or gross breaches 
occurring before the commencement date. But that is a different question from 
the  admissibility  of  evidence  about  the  nature  or  qualitative  assessment  of 
those breaches (i.e whether gross or not). Nothing in section 20 or 27 prevents 
such evidence being adduced, if relevant and otherwise admissible.  

LSEL was of course under the same continuing common law duty of care to 
its employee Mr Berry in the civil law of negligence both before and after the 
commencement date. A breach of that duty arising after the commencement 
 
date is relevant to the offence under section 1.  If there is evidence that as at 
the 6th April 2008 or thereafter the management had not taken steps to put into 
 
practice protective measures for employees which they had known for some 
years  should  be  taken,  the  fact  that  a  commencement  date  occurred  on  6th 
 
April does not affect the nature of the duty at all, nor the existence of their 
accumulated knowledge. The conduct complained of would be that occurring 
 
after the commencement date, but , if established, would consist of a failure to 
 
implement  a  requirement  or  advice  or  good  practice  of  which  the  senior 
management had known since before then. 

But it must be remembered that a fundamental part of the Crown’s case must 
 
also be to show that any breach was gross. On the interpretation of the statute 
which I have found, the breach in question can only be one occurring in the 
period  from  the  6th  April  onwards.  Again,  in  my  judgement,  and  subject 
always to the evidence that is adduced, a breach may be considered as gross in 
 
late April 2008 because (for example) it consisted of a failure at that time to 
act on knowledge gained long before. 

But this is not a simple cosmetic point. There is no doubt that until the Crown 
sat  down  and  thought  about  Mr  Turner’s  point,  it  was  relying  on  a  long 
chronology of failings going back over several years, and it still relies on them 
under Count 2. Mr Turner is quite right when he says that the case now being 
argued by the Crown against him (i.e that it does not look to earlier breaches, 
but  just  looks  at  the  response  to  the  continuing  duty  but  in  its  historical 
context) is an attempt to execute a neat volte face.  

 
46.	 

But  that  would  not  be  fatal  as  a  matter  of  substantive  law  to  Count  1 
proceeding, providing that the jury is only asked to consider events before 6th 
 
April 2008 in the context of 

 
i) 

 
ii)	 

 
 
informing their decision as to whether the senior management knew of 
facts as at 6th April 2008 or later, or 

whether their knowledge of past events rendered their  conduct as at 6th 
 
April  2008  or  afterwards  as  amounting  to  a  gross  breach  of  the  duty 
upon them.

--------
Section  27  of  the  Act  is  not  an  exercise  in  amnesia,  but  it  is  an  exercise  in 
preventing the punishment as criminal of activities which occurred before the 
Act came into force.  

 
47.	 

However  the  route  by  which  evidence  of  past  dealings  is  admitted  is  not 
without difficulty. I shall consider that next.

The discussion in the last section has shown that evidence of the accumulated 
knowledge and of past activities may be admissible under Count 1, so the fact 
that the Act is prospective in effect may not therefore exclude evidence of past 
misconduct.  

But one must be careful to address the route to admissibility of such evidence. 
 
Evidence of gross breaches of duty on the part of the three other Defendants is 
to  be  called  by  the  Crown,  as  part  of  its  case  against  those  Defendants  that 
they are guilty of manslaughter under Count 2. (Note:  I am here dealing with 
 
gross breaches not breaches which are relevant to Counts 3-5) 

If  those  Defendants  were  not  being  tried  together  with  LSEL,  that  evidence 
would not be admissible in the trial of LSEL, unless an application were made 
 
under sections 98 ff of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Given that the Crown’s 
 
case is that the conduct of the other three Defendants was reprehensible (and is 
therefore evidence of bad character within  section 98) , it must follow that it 
could only be admitted against LSEL if it passed through a gateway in section 
 
100  of  the  Act.  Section  101  is  not  relevant  as  none  of  them  would  be  a 
Defendant if LSEL were tried alone. Similarly, as the evidence of past conduct 
 
is  by  definition  not  conduct  falling  within  “activities”  in  section  1,  it  is  not 
excluded from the scope of “ bad character”  by section 98(b) of the 2003 Act. 

I am prepared to accept that it could amount to important explanatory evidence 
under section 100 (1) (a) or (b), which read 

“100 (1) 
 
 

 
 

(a) 
(b)	 
 
 

it is important explanatory evidence, 
it has substantial probative value in relation to a 
matter which— 

(i)is a matter in issue in the proceedings, and 
(ii)is  of  substantial  importance  in  the  context  of 
the case as a whole” 

But its relevance is not unrestricted. It only passes muster if it goes to an issue 
germane to Count 1, i.e. whether the directors had the relevant knowledge on 
or after 6th April 2008, and whether  any breach on or  after 6th April 2008 was 
 
gross. 
But  now  one  asks  what  happens  when  Count  1  is  tried  with  Count  2.  It  is 
 
important to note that the issue in a general sense of whether there was or were 
 
a  gross  breach/breaches  of  duty  by  those  directors  is  common  to  all  four 
 
Defendants . The critical difference between LSEL on the one hand, and the 
Second to Fourth Defendants on the other, is that the court is not concerned in 
the case of Count 1 whether the breaches before April 2008 are to be regarded 
as gross; indeed they are irrelevant, save for the purposes I have referred to 
already.  It follows that the jury will have to be directed that while it can and 
must consider whether the conduct of the any or all of the Second to Fourth 
Defendants  on  Count  2  in  the  years  before  April  2008  amounted  to  a  gross 
 
breach insofar as the case against him or them is concerned, it must not treat 
that as determinative of whether there was a gross breach after 6th April 2008, 
and  because  of  the  terms  of  section  1(3)  about  senior  management,  must 

 

30
--------
54.	 

 
55.	 

 
56.	 

 

 
consider separately what the state of mind was of the same Defendants as at 
6th April 2008 and subsequently. 
There are of course cases where juries are routinely directed that they must set 
aside  part  of  the  evidence  when  considering  the  case  of  one  or  some  of  a 
number of Defendants. A commonplace example involves the direction to the 
jury in the trial of A, B and C that what A and B told the Police C had done is 
not evidence against C. That is not a difficult concept to grasp; juries are well 
used  to  discounting  allegations  made  by  A  against  C  in  the  absence  of  C, 
although  there  are  (albeit  fairly  rare)  cases  where  the  effect  of  what  one 
Defendant has said is so prejudicial that there should be separate trials of one 
co-Defendant from another. But this is different. Here the jury are required to 
consider the conduct of the directors P W and C on Count 2, including their 
 
conduct both before and after 6th April 2008, and on Count 1 consider their 
conduct, but only insofar as it happened after 6th April 2008, and exclude what 
 
happened before, and exclude consideration of whether what happened before 
amounted to a gross breach, save for considering if what occurred later was a 
 
gross breach. 
On  any  view  that  requires  a  direction  to  the  jury  which  might,  even  with  a 
 
substantial amount of optimism, be said to be one of considerable complexity. 
But  it  also  generates  the  potential  for  unfairness  to  the  First  Defendant, 
because it could easily lead to the jury effectively treating pre commencement 
 
conduct  of  a  type  criminalised  by  the  2007  Act  if  it  occurred  after 
 
commencement as conduct falling within the ambit of Count 1. That is in part 
 
the consequence of the legislation electing to create a new offence rather than 
dealing  with  the  nature  of  the  evidence  admissible  to  prove  the  existing 
 
common law offence. But whatever the reason, it runs a considerable risk that, 
as actually tried by a jury, the offence in Count 1 would be looked at as if its 
ambit was of retrospective effect.  
Unlike the situation relating to a Defendant’s bad character under gateway (d) 
in  section  101(1)  (see  section  101(3))  ,  the  Court  has  no  power  to  exclude 
evidence  admissible  under  section  100,  save  for  the  general  power  of 
exclusion  under  section  78  of  the  Police  and  Criminal  Evidence  Act  1984. 
However a judge could not exclude such evidence for one purpose  but allow 
its inclusion for another. Either the evidence will be called and heard, or it will 
not. 

 

 

 

 
(4) What will the effect be of Count 1 being tried alongside Count 2, where 
evidence of earlier activities is undoubtedly admissible against the three 
 
directors ? 

 
57.	 

 
58.	 

 

As already indicated, I consider that the situation created here has the potential 
for unfairness. I have the power to order Count 1 to be stayed or severed from 
the other counts. 
Before deciding whether or not to prevent Count 1 being tried with the other 
counts, I must look to see whether there are any countervailing considerations. 
 
LSEL  is  charged  with  corporate  manslaughter,  and  with  offences  under  the 
HSWA. All of the material upon which the Crown seeks to rely is admissible 
in the context of Count 3. Those who control this company – the three other 
Defendants-  are  all  charged  with  manslaughter  and  with  specific  offences 
under the 1974 Act. It is a matter for the prosecuting authority what offences it 

31
--------
59.	 

 
60.	 

 
63.	 

 
64.	 

 

alleges,  but  the  fact  is  that  those  who  were  in  charge  already  face  serious 
charges, and the company is charged with serious regulatory offences, which 
would attract significant financial penalty in the event of a conviction, albeit 
less than would be likely should it be convicted of corporate manslaughter. 
The  trial  of  Counts  2  to  5  without  Count  1  will  not  limit  the  Crown  in  the 
evidence it can call, and, if convictions occur on Counts 3 and/or 5, will still 
expose LSEL to substantial penalty. If they are tried together, I consider that it 
creates  a  real  risk  of  unfairness  to  LSEL.  It  will  also  create  a  formidably 
 
difficult  task  for  the  jury,  who  will  have  to  deal  with  evidence  of  direct 
relevance to the causation of the death if considered under Count 2, but which 
they  will  be  directed  to  ignore,  save  for  limited  purposes,  when  addressing 
Count 1. I regard that as simply unrealistic.  
For that reason, and in exercise of my case management powers, I order that 
Count 1 be severed from the indictment and, should the Crown wish to pursue 
 
it to trial,  tried separately. 

 

 
62.	 

 
Other applications 
 
61.	  Mr Turner objects to the inclusion of Count 5 in the indictment, on the basis 
that  it  adds  nothing  to  Count  3.  He  also  points  out  that  Count  5  does  not 
specify the Regulation whose breach is asserted. Mr Jackson contends that the 
allegation  of  the  Working  at  Height  Regulations  relates  to  a  number  of 
different breaches. He says that all those breaches go also to the allegation in 
Count 3. 
One  must  be  realistic  here.  The  prosecution  case  on  breach  of  the  statutory 
duties of LSEL is that Mr Berry was asked to go onto a roof to do repair work 
when he was untrained, and when proper precautions had not been taken. That 
is fully dealt with in Count 3. If LSEL was also convicted under Count 5, it 
would not make any difference to sentence. I could detect nothing in what Mr 
Jackson put before me which showed that Count 5 added anything to Count 3. 
Count 5 is currently not particularised. Given that it adds nothing, I shall stay 
it, and the trial can proceed on Counts 2 to 4. 
Lastly Mr Turner argues that LSEL should not be first on the indictment, and 
in particular that he should cross examine last, and present his case last. 

65.	  Mr Jackson did not take any real objection to this application, which was also 
 
supported by the other Defendants.  I am of the view that it is logical if LSEL 
goes last. The allegations made by the Crown relate largely to the conduct of 
the three directors who are the other Defendants, which is then regarded as the 
company’s conduct in the context of Count 3. It would have been even more 
 
important  if  Count  1  were  tried  with  the  other  counts,  when  factual  cross 
examination on events may be required.

Lady Justice Hallett: 

R –v- Rollings 

On 6 July 2011, at about 12.30 pm police officers from the Southwark Drugs and Firearms 
 
unit were preparing to execute a search warrant at a flat in Brockley, south London, the 
home of offender’s girlfriend when they became aware that the offender was outside in a 
mini-cab. The officers approached the cab, and detained the offender.   

He was wearing a small leather bag over his shoulder. The bag was searched. Inside, the 
police  found  a  handgun  wrapped  in  a  yellow  dust  cloth.  The  serial  number  had  been 
removed. It was a .357 Magnum calibre Smith and Wesson revolver with a six-shooting 
swing out cylinder in full working order. In the cylinder were two Federal Hydra-Shok .38 
special calibre cartridges and three .357 magnum calibre PMP cartridges. The ammunition 
was live and, on test firing, the bullets were found to mushroom on impact. They were what 
 
are commonly known as “dumdum” bullets, a particularly dangerous kind.  

The offender was arrested and cautioned. He said: ‘Can you do me a favour? Please don’t 
tell my girlfriend.’ When asked whether the gun had been at her house, he replied: ‘No, 
well only this morning.’ Later that day he was interviewed under caution in the presence of 
his  solicitor.  The  offender  made  no  comment  to  all  material  questions.  He  was  then 
charged.  Subsequent  DNA  analysis  of  a  swab  taken  from  the  gun  produced  a  full  DNA 
 
profile which matched that of the offender. The probability of such a match in the event that 
 
the DNA on the gun was from someone other than the offender was in the order of one in a 
billion. 

 

The offender has a number of previous convictions, a reprimand and a warning. In 2005, he 
was reprimanded for a public order offence and warned for theft. In 2006, he was convicted 
of criminal damage, and given a referral order. In 2007, he was convicted of possessing 
cocaine and MDMA with intent to supply, and sentenced to 18 months’ youth detention. In 
2008, he was convicted of driving without insurance and fined. In 2009, he was convicted 
of possessing cocaine and made the subject of a community order.  

On  9  September  2011,  he  appeared  at  the  Woolwich  Crown  Court  at  a  plea  and  case 
management hearing. He pleaded guilty to one count of possessing a prohibited weapon, 
 
contrary  to  section  5(1)(aba)  of  the  Firearms  Act  1968  (Count  2),  and  one  count  of 
 
possessing prohibited ammunition, contrary to section 5(1A)(f) of the same Act (Count 3). 
He pleaded not guilty to one count of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life or to 
enable another to do so, contrary to section 16 of the FA 1968 (Count 1). On the morning of 
the  trial,  10  November  2011,  he  sought  a  ‘Goodyear  indication’.  Ms  Kettle-Williams 
 
representing him placed the facts and proposed basis of plea before the judge His Honour 
Judge Crawford Lindsay QC.

The  judge  issued  the  necessary  warnings  about  the  possibility  of  a  Reference  by  Her 
Majesty’s  Attorney  General.  He  then  indicated  that  the  maximum  sentence  he  would 
impose  was  in  fact  the  minimum  sentence  he  was  bound  to  impose,  (pursuant  to  the 
Firearms  Act  1968  as  amended),  absent  exceptional  circumstances,  namely  5  years’ 
imprisonment. The offender was re-arraigned on Count 1, and pleaded guilty on the basis 
that  he  had  possession  of  the  firearm  and  the  ammunition  with  the  intention  of  enabling 
another to endanger life. 

Prosecuting counsel opened the facts. Ms Kettle-Williams agreed with the judge that there 
was  little  she  could  add  to  what  had  already  been  said  during  the  ‘Goodyear  indication’ 
 
proceedings.  She  was  not  pressed  to  explain  the  circumstances  in  which  the  offender 
intended that the person to whom he supplied the gun might endanger life. With no further 
ado,  the  judge  sentenced  the  offender  to  5  years’  imprisonment  on  Count  1,  5  years 
concurrent on Count 2, and 3 years concurrent on Count 3. The total sentence was therefore 
5 years’ imprisonment. A period of 125 days was ordered to count as time served as part of 
the sentence under section 240 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003.  Her Majesty’s Solicitor 
General  Edward  Garnier  QC  has  applied  for  leave  to  refer  the  sentence  to  this  court  as 
 
being unduly lenient. We give leave. 

The  Solicitor  General  put  the  following  aggravating  features  before  us  for  our 
consideration. 

 
i.	 
 
ii.	 
 
iii.	 
 
iv.	 

The offender was found in possession of a gun and live ammunition. 
The ammunition was loaded into the gun. 
The ammunition was of a type which expanded on impact. 
The offender was in possession of the prohibited items in a residential area. 

He suggested the following mitigating features are present: 

The offender pleaded guilty.  
The gun was not discharged. 
The offender does not have previous convictions in relation to firearms offences 

 
v.	 
 
vi.	 
 
vii.	 
viii.	  The offender is a man of a relatively young age. He was 23 at the time of the 

 

offences. 

 

However, Mr Garnier also observed that the plea to count 1 was entered on the day of trial 
and the evidence of his possession of the firearm and ammunition may properly be 
characterised as overwhelming. 

 
A number of decisions relating to sentencing in firearms offences were put before us. We 
shall mention just three. We begin with Tony Avis and others 1998 2 Cr App R (S) 178 in 
which Lord Bingham CJ observed at page 181:
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R –v- Rollings 

 

“The appropriate level of sentence for a firearms offence, as for any 
other offence, will depend on all the facts and circumstances relevant 
 
to the offence and the offender, and it would be wrong for this court 
to seek to prescribe unduly restrictive sentencing guidelines. It will, 
 
however, usually be appropriate for the sentencing court to ask itself 
 
a series of questions: 

(1)  What  sort  of  weapon  is  involved?  Genuine  firearms  are  more 
dangerous  than  imitation  firearms.  Loaded  firearms  are  more 
dangerous than unloaded firearms. …..Unloaded firearms for which 
ammunition is available are more dangerous than firearms for which 
no  ammunition  is  available.  Possession  of  a  firearm  which  has  no 
lawful use (such as a sawn-off shotgun) will be viewed even more 
 
seriously than possession of a firearm which is capable of lawful use. 

(2) What (if any) use has been made of the firearm? It is necessary 
 
for  the  court,  as  with  any  other  offence,  to  take  account  of  all 
circumstances  surrounding  any  use  made  of  the  firearm:  the  more 
prolonged and premeditated and violent the use, the more serious the 
offence is likely to be. 

 

(3) With what intention (if any) did the defendant possess or use the 
firearm? Generally speaking, the most serious offences under the Act 
are  those  which  require  proof  of  a  specific  criminal  intent  (to 
endanger life, to cause fear of violence, to resist arrest, to commit an 
indictable  offence).  The  more  serious  the  act  intended,  the  more 
 
serious the offence. 

(4) What is the defendant's record? The seriousness of any firearm 
offence  is  inevitably  increased  if  the  offender  has  an  established 
record of committing firearms offences or crimes of violence.”  

 

 
11.	 

Having reviewed the hierarchy of firearms offences he concluded at page 186:  

“ Where there are breaches of sections 4, 5, 16, 16A, 17(1) and (2), 
18(1),  19  or  21,  the  custodial  term  is  likely  to  be  of  considerable 
length, and where the four questions suggested above yield answers 
adverse to the offender, terms at or approaching the maximum may 
in a contested case be appropriate.” 

 

 

 
12.	 

 

In  Attorney  General’s  Reference  Nos  58-66  of  2002  [2003]  EWCA  Crim  636  the  court 
conducted a review of a number of decisions (including Avis) on the appropriate level of 
 
sentence  to  be  imposed  for  possession  of  firearms  and  ammunition  with  intention  to 
endanger life. At paragraph 48 of the judgment the court concluded that
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R –v- Rollings 

 

 

“in  a  contested  case  simple  possession  of  a  firearm  together  with 
 
ammunition with intent to endanger life merits a sentence of between 
 
seven and eight years.” 

 

13.	  We turn finally to the most recent decision on this topic brought to our attention: AG ref no 
43 of 2009 (Craig Bennett); R v Grant Wilkinson  2010 1 Cr App R (S) 100. Lord Judge CJ, 
giving the judgment of the court, observed:  

 

“2. The gravity of gun crime cannot be exaggerated. Guns kill and 
 
maim, terrorise and intimidate. That is why criminals want them: that 
is why they use them: and that is why they organise their importation 
 
and  manufacture,  supply  and  distribution.  Sentencing  courts  must 
address  the  fact  that  too  many  lethal  weapons  are  too  readily 
available:  too  many  are  carried:  too  many  are  used,  always  with 
devastating effect on individual victims and with insidious corrosive 
impact on the wellbeing of the local community.  

“3.  The  purposes  of  sentencing  are  identified  in  section  142  of  the 
2003 Act. None of these purposes is pre-eminent. All apply to every 
case, but as a matter of sentencing reality, whenever a gun is made 
available for use as well as when a gun is used public protection is 
the  paramount  consideration.  Deterrent  and  punitive  sentences  are 
required and should be imposed.” 

 

 
14.	 

 

Further,  Lord  Judge  specifically  endorsed  the  continued  value  of  the  series  of  questions 
posed  by  Lord  Bingham  in  Avis.  We  shall  now  pose  those  questions  in  respect  of  this 
offence  and  this  offender.  The  answers  are  mostly  adverse  to  him.  The  weapon  was  a 
genuine firearm loaded and deadly. The ammunition was particularly dangerous. There was 
no lawful use for the gun. The offender was not simply a custodian. He intended to supply 
the  loaded  gun  to  a  fellow  criminal  or  criminals  who  required  it  for  their  criminal 
enterprise. The offender has not informed the court of the nature of the enterprise and we 
shall avoid speculation. Suffice it to say the consequences were potentially extremely grave 
 
for the victim or victims of the offence. It is fortuitous that the police stepped in when they 
did.  He  is  no  stranger  to  the  courts.  On  the  positive  side,  the  offender  is  still  relatively 
young and does not have an established record of committing firearms offences. 

 

15.	  Mr Garnier provided background information to explain why it was his contention that the 
courts  should  treat  those  who  trade  in  illegal  firearms  severely,  possibly  as  severely  as 
 
those who actually use them to commit an offence. He informed us that there is a limited 
supply  of  firearms  which  are  moved  around  the  criminal  fraternity  in  such  a  way  that 
several  crimes  may  be  committed  with  one  gun.  Those  involved  in  the  supply  chain  of
--------

R –v- Rollings 

weapons play a pivotal role in keeping violent criminals in business, with all the risks that 
this entails for the public. He also suggested that the sentencing regime as it relates to the 
use  of  firearms  has  moved  on  considerably  since  the  decision  in  Attorney  General’s 
Reference Nos 58-66 of 2002. In addition to Lord Judge’s remarks in Wilkinson, there has 
been  the  introduction  of  the  minimum  5  year  term  for  possession  of  a  firearm  and  the 
introduction  of  a  30  year  starting  point  for  offences  of  murder  involving  the  use  of  a 
firearm. Thus, had this gun been used to kill, as was always possible given its lethal nature, 
 
the  murderer  would  have  been  looking  at  the  equivalent  of  a  60  year  determinate  term. 
Given the dangers to the public, the prevalence of gun crime and the need for deterrent and 
punitive sentencing, to which Lord Judge referred in Wilkinson, Mr Garnier submitted the 
 
sentencing range for offences of this gravity has increased significantly. We agree.  

Given  those  developments,  there  can  be  no  argument  that  the  sentence  of  5  years’ 
imprisonment  imposed  on  Count  3  for  the  offence  of  possession  with  intent  was  unduly 
lenient. Arguably, terms of 5 and 3 years’ imprisonment were also unduly lenient for the 
offences of simple possession of the weapon and the ammunition (Counts 2 and 3). In the 
light of our decision on Count 1, we do not need to decide the point. Counts 2 and 3 were 
alternative charges to Count 1 and had the offender pleaded guilty to Count 1 at the outset, 
they would have been left on the file. In normal circumstances, the judge may well have 
 
imposed no separate penalty on those counts. Here the judge may have felt constrained by 
the  fact  that  Count  2  was  also  subject  to  a  minimum  term  (absent  exceptional 
circumstances). Counsel did not address him or us on whether exceptional circumstances 
 
existed  on  Count  2  by  virtue  of  the  fact  it  was  an  alternative  charge.  We  are  not  in  a 
position, therefore, to take this aspect of the case further. Accordingly, we shall not disturb 
the sentences imposed on Counts 2 and 3.  

 

To  her  credit  Ms  Kettle-Williams  accepted  that  we  would  find,  as  we  have,  that  the 
sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment is lenient, but, in her helpful and succinct submissions, 
she  urged  us  not  to  interfere  with  the  sentence  or  to  limit  any  increase  in  the  term.  She 
 
placed reliance on and emphasised the mitigating features put before us by Mr Garnier to 
which she wished to add the principle of ‘ double jeopardy’. 

Her task was always going to be an uphill one. It should be remembered that the 5 year 
minimum term is a minimum term not a “mandatory” term (as prosecuting counsel at one 
stage described it in the court below) nor is it a “starting point” (in the sense used by the 
Sentencing  Council)  as  the  judge  described  it.  It  certainly  should  not  have  been  the 
 
finishing point. This was a case of possession of a loaded firearm with intent. The gun was 
loaded  with  particularly  dangerous  ammunition.  The  consequences  of  the  offender’s 
actions, as we have endeavoured to explain, were potentially lethal.  

The  offender  had  little  option  but  to  plead  guilty  to  possession  of  the  weapon  and  the 
 
ammunition, given the circumstances of his arrest and the DNA evidence. Given the nature

of the bullets loaded in the gun some may think he had little option but to plead guilty to 
 
the more serious offence. This he did belatedly. However, we are prepared to proceed on 
the basis he would be entitled to credit of 10 % for his plea of guilty to the more serious

R -V- LAVINIA DESUZE
 
 

 

 
SENTENCING REMARKS
 

 

17 APRIL 2012 


 

 

 

Lavinia Desuze was convicted by a jury of perverting the course of justice. She destroyed and 

disposed of distinctive clothing that her son had worn on the day of the killing and which was 

 
seen on CCTV. According to the evidence she gave at her trial, on the night of Saturday, 13th 

 
August, she cut up the sweater, T shirt and white bag worn by her son on 8th August. Having 

 

 

 

cut them up, she went off on her bike at midnight and deposited the pieces in two litter bins 

some way away from her house.  

 

Her evidence at trial was that she did that to avoid people who had seen her son on TV 

wearing the items identifying him and exacting violent retribution on him for participating in 

the riots. The jury disbelieved that account and were sure that the reason she cut up the 

clothes was to try to prevent her son being apprehended by the police.  

 

 

At the time she destroyed the clothing, she was aware that a man other than her son had 

been arrested for the offence and, by the actions she took, she increased the chance of that 

man being brought to court and wrongly prosecuted. She must have been aware of that at the 

 

time. 

 

When the police came to her house, she immediately admitted to them that she had 

 

destroyed the clothing. She directed the police to the place where   she said she had disposed
--------
of the clothing but it had gone. I have no reason to doubt that she was being truthful to the 

police. 

 

The offence that the police were investigating was a very serious one. It was a murder 

inquiry. She did not persist in the offence by telling the police a false story when they came to 

 

her house nor did she involve her son in what she had done. In the event her actions did not 

succeed in defeating the course of justice although they clearly could have done. 

 

I do feel, as most people would, some sympathy for Lavinia Desuze. On the jury’s verdict, 

even though she committed a very serious offence, she did so to protect her young son to 

whom she had given birth when she was only 14 and who she had looked after  as  a single 

mother  for most of his life,  although his father and grandmother did play  important parts 

in bringing up Darrell. I accept that the instinct of a mother to protect her child is a very 

 

 

powerful one. If she had felt able to admit what she had done, it would have made it easier to 

be lenient. Instead she continued to deny committing any offence and, on the verdict of the 

 

jury, lied on oath.  

 

I realise that seeing her son go into custody today will be a severe penalty to her. I also bear 

in mind her good character. I have considered the authorities to which I have been referred 

 

and the guidance that has been given by the Court of Appeal. That Court has made it clear 

 

 

that perverting the course of justice is always a serious offence which invariably must attract 

an immediate sentence of imprisonment. While the attempt to pervert was not persisted in 
 

 

and was ultimately unsuccessful, the course of justice involved a murder investigation. The 

least sentence that I can properly impose taking everything into account is one of 18 months 
 

 

imprisonment.",2012-04-17 00:00:00,UK Crown Court

The Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales: 
 

Introduction 
  

R – v - Clinton, Parker & Evans 

 

 
1.	 

 
2.	 

 
3.	 

 
4.	 

The  difficulties  of  giving  consistent  effect  to  section  3  of  the  Homicide  Act  1957, 
which encapsulated in statutory form the common law defence of provocation, were 
notorious. As Professor David Ormerod observes in Smith & Hogan’s, Criminal Law, 
13th Edition, “For the appellate courts to fluctuate so often and so significantly on the 
interpretations  of  a  defence  in  cases  of  such  seriousness  led  to  confusion  and 
presented  a  disappointing  spectacle”.  This  measured  criticism  is  entirely  justified. 
 
With effect from 4 October 2010 section 3 of the 1957 Act ceased to have effect. The 
 
ancient common law defence of provocation, reducing murder to manslaughter, was 
abolished and consigned to legal history books. 

It was replaced by sections 54 and 55 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (the 2009 
Act) which created a new partial defence to murder, “loss of control”.  Just because 
loss of control was an essential ingredient of the old provocation defence, the name is 
 
evocative of it.  It therefore needs to be emphasised at the outset that the new statutory 
defence is self-contained.  Its common law heritage is irrelevant.  The full ambit of 
the defence is encompassed within these statutory provisions.  Unfortunately there are 
 
aspects  of  the  legislation  which,  to  put  it  with  appropriate  deference,  are  likely  to 
produce surprising results. 

 

In order to enlighten our understanding our attention was drawn to different passages 
in the Report of the Law Commission (Report No. 290, Partial Defence as to Murder 
 
(2004), the Law Commission Consultation Paper No. 177, A New Homicide Act for 
 
England  (2005)  and  the  Law  Commission  Report  No.  304  (Murder,  Manslaughter 
and  Infanticide  (2006).  In  July  2008  the  Ministry  of  Justice  issued  its  consultation 
paper in response to these recommendations, Murder, Manslaughter and Infanticide; 
proposals for reform of the law.  Although the title of the Law Commission Report 
was adopted, its contents were selectively chosen. Looked at overall, the legislation 
does not sufficiently follow the recommendations of the Law Commission to enable 
us  to  discern  any  close  link  between  the  views  and  recommendations  of  the  Law 
Commission and the legislation as enacted.  

In these appeals the main focus of our attention is the controversial provision which 
relates to the impact on the “loss of control” defence of what is described as “sexual 
 
infidelity”.  We  looked,  de  bene  esse,  at  the  debates  in  Parliament  prior  to  the 
enactment. Even on the most generous interpretation of Pepper v Hart, the debates 
 
did not reveal anything which assisted in the process of legislative construction.  So 
we must ascertain the meaning of these provisions from their language.   As we shall 
 
explain,  however,  the  conclusion  we  have  reached  is  consistent  not  only  with  the 
views which would have been expressed by those who were opposed to this provision 
 
in  its  entirety,  but  also  with  the  views  expressed  by  ministers  responsible  for  the 
legislation during its passage through Parliament. 

 

The convictions 

 
5.	 

These are appeals against conviction for murder by:
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. 
 
 

R – v - Clinton, Parker & Evans 

 

(a) Jon-Jacques Clinton was born in 1965.  On 15th November 2010 he killed his wife, 
Dawn Clinton, then aged 33 years, in the family home in Bracknell.  On 23rd May 
2011,  in  the  Crown  Court  at  Reading  before  Her  Honour  Judge  Smith,  he  was 
 
convicted  of  murder  and  arson.    On  the  following  day  he  was  sentenced  to 
imprisonment for life on count 1, with a specified minimum term of 26 years, less 187 
days, for murder and to 2 years imprisonment concurrent on count 2.  The verdict was 
returned by the jury after considering the partial defence of diminished responsibility. 
 
Judge Smith ruled that there was insufficient evidence of loss of control for that issue 
 
to be considered by the jury.  The correctness or otherwise of this decision forms the 
 
basis for the present appeal. 

(b) On 26th October 2010 Stephen Parker killed his wife, Jane Parker, in the family 
home in ….  On 9th May 2011, in the Crown Court at Hull before His Honour Judge 
Mettyear, the jury rejected the loss of control defence and convicted him of murdering 
his wife.  He was sentenced to imprisonment for life.  The specified minimum term 
was 17 years, less 196 days. 

(c) Dewi Evans killed his wife … on 11th November 2010 in the matrimonial home in 
South Wales.  On 29th June 2011, in the Crown Court at Swansea before Mr Justice 
 
 
Lloyd Jones, again, the jury rejected the loss of control defence and he was convicted 
of murdering his wife.  He was sentenced to imprisonment for life, with a minimum 
specified term of 11 years, less 248 days. 

The legislation 

The “loss of control” defence 

 
6. 

Section 54 of the 2009 Act provides: 

“Partial Defence to Murder: loss of control 
 

Where a person (“D”) kills or is party to the killing of 

(1) 
another (“V”), D is not to be convicted of murder if – 

(a) D’s acts and omissions in doing or being a party to 
the killing resulted from D’s loss of self-control, 

(b) the loss of self-control had a qualifying trigger, and 

(c) a person of D’s sex and age, with a normal degree 
 
of tolerance and self-restraint and in the circumstances 
 
of  D,  might  have  reacted  in  the  same  or  in  a  similar 
way to D. 

(2)  For  the  purposes  of  subsection  (1)(a),  it  does  not  matter 
whether or not the loss of control was sudden. 

(3) 
In subsection 1(c) the reference to “the circumstances of D” 
is a reference to all of D’s circumstances other than those whose 
only  relevance  to  D’s  conduct  is  that  they  bear  on  D’s  general 
capacity for tolerance or self-restraint.

R – v - Clinton, Parker & Evans 

 

(4)  Subsection (1) does not apply if, in doing or being a party to 
the killing, D acted in a considered desire for revenge. 

(5)  On a charge of murder, if sufficient evidence is adduced to 
 
raise an issue with respect to the defence under subsection (1), the 
jury  must  assume  that  the  defence  is  satisfied  unless  the 
prosecution proves beyond reasonable doubt that it is not. 

(6)  For  the  purposes  of  subsection  (5),  sufficient  evidence  is 
 
adduced to raise an issue with respect to the defence if evidence is 
adduced  on  which,  in  the  opinion  of  the  trial  judge,  a  jury, 
properly  directed,  could  reasonably  conclude  that  the  defence 
might apply. 

(7)  A  person  who,  but  for  this  section,  would  be  liable  to  be 
convicted  of  murder  is  liable  instead  to  be  convicted  of 
manslaughter. 

 

(8)  The fact that one party to a killing is by virtue of this section 
 
not liable to be convicted of murder does not affect the question 
whether the killing amounted to murder in the case of any other 
party to it. ” 

 
7. 

Section 55 provides: 

“Meaning of “qualifying trigger” 

(1) 
 

This section applies for the purposes of section 54. 

(2) 
subsection (3), (4) or (5) applies. 

A  loss  of  self-control  had  a  qualifying  trigger  if 

(3) 
This subsection applies if D’s loss of self-control was 
attributable to D’s fear of serious violence from V against D or 
 
another identified person. 

(4) 
attributable to a thing or things done or said (or both) which – 

This subsection applies if D’s loss of self-control was 

constituted circumstances of an extremely grave 

(a) 
character, and 

caused  D  to  have  a  justifiable  sense  of  being 

(b) 
seriously wronged. 

 

(5)  This  subsection  applies  if  D’s  loss  of  self-control  was 
 
attributable  to  a  combination  of  the  matters  mentioned  in 
subsections (3) and (4). 

In  determining  whether  a  loss  of  self-control  had  a 
 

(6) 
qualifying trigger –
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R – v - Clinton, Parker & Evans 

 

(a)  D’s fear of serious violence is to be disregarded to the 
extent  that  it  was  caused  by  a  thing  which  D  incited  to  be 
 
done or said for the purpose of providing an excuse to use 
violence; 

(b) 
a sense of being seriously wronged by a thing done or 
said is not justifiable if D incited the thing to be done or said 
for the purpose of providing an excuse to use violence; 

the  fact  that  a  thing  done  or  said  constituted  sexual 

(c) 
 
infidelity is to be disregarded. 

(7)  In  this  section  references  to  “D”  and  “V”  are  to  be  construed  in 
accordance with section 54.” 

This  is  the  “loss  of  control”  defence  in  its  entirety.    Its  components  are  set  out  in 
section 54(1), as amplified in section 55. There is however a further reference in the 
2009  Act  to  the  concept  of  loss  of  control.    Section  2  of  the  Homicide  Act  1957, 
which dealt with the diminished responsibility defence, has been replaced by section 
52 of the 2009 Act and, as with the law relating to provocation, the ingredients of the 
defence have changed.  Its potential relevance to the issues under discussion is readily 
identified.  There  are  cases,  and  Clinton  was  one,  where  the  defences  of  loss  of 
 
control  and  diminished  responsibility  will  be  raised  in  the  same  proceedings.    The 
 
defence arises from an abnormality of mental functioning which 

“… (b) substantially impaired D’s ability to do one or more of 
the things mentioned in sub-section (1a) and … 

(1A) those things are -

(a) to understand the nature of D’s conduct; 

(b) to form a rational judgment; 

(c) to exercise self-control. …” 

 

The  first  feature  of  section  54  is  that  it  identifies  three  statutory  components  (or 
ingredients) to the “loss of control” defence.   We begin by emphasising that each is 
integral  to  it.    If  one  is  absent,  the  defence  fails.    It  is  therefore  inevitable  that  the 
components  should  be  analysed  sequentially  and  separately.    However,  it  is  worth 
emphasising that in many cases where there is a genuine loss of control, the remaining 
components are likely to arise for consideration simultaneously or virtually so, at or 
very close to the moment when the fatal violence is used.  Further, the discussion will 
 
proceed  in  terms  which  suggest  that  the  defendant  seeking  to  advance  the  loss  of 
control defence is not always male.  This is because experience shows that women as 
well  as  men  kill  when  they  have  lost  self  control.    In  the  legislation  no  special 
provision is made for the gender of the killer.  Finally, by way of introduction, we do 
not overlook that the burden of disproof is on the prosecution.

--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

The first component 

R – v - Clinton, Parker & Evans 

 

 
10.	 

For  present  purposes,  subsection  1(a),  which  addresses  the  first  ingredient,  is  self 
 
explanatory.  The killing must have resulted from the loss of self control. The loss of 
control  need  not  be  sudden,  but  it  must  have  been  lost.  That  is  essential.    Before 
 
reaching the second ingredient, the qualifying trigger, there is a further hurdle, that the 
defendant  must  not  have  been  acting  in  a  “considered”  desire  for  revenge.    The 
possible  significance  of  “considered”  arises  in  the  appeal  of  Evans.  In  the  broad 
context of the legislative structure, there does not appear to be very much room for 
 
any “considered” deliberation.  In reality, the greater the level of deliberation, the less 
likely it will be that the killing followed a true loss of self control. 

The second component 

 
11.	 

The qualifying trigger provisions are self contained in section 55.  There is no point in 
pretending that the practical application of this provision will not create considerable 
 
difficulties.  Sections  55(3)  and  (4)  define  the  circumstances  in  which  a  qualifying 
 
trigger may be present.  The statutory language is not bland.  In section 55(3) it is not 
enough that the defendant is fearful of violence.  He must fear serious violence.  In 
subsection (4)(a) the circumstances must not merely be grave, but extremely so.  In 
subsection  (4)(b)  it  is  not  enough  that  the  defendant  has  been  caused  by  the 
 
circumstances to feel a sense of grievance.  It must arise from a justifiable sense not 
 
merely that he has been wronged, but that he has been seriously wronged.  By contrast 
with the former law of provocation, these provisions, as Mr Michael Birnbaum QC, 
 
on behalf of Clinton submitted, have raised the bar.  We have been used to a much 
less prescriptive approach to the provocation defence. 

 

12.	  Mr Birnbaum submitted, and we think correctly, that the defendant himself must have 
a sense of having been seriously wronged. However even if he has, that is not the end 
of  it.  In  short,  the  defendant  cannot  invite  the  jury  to  acquit  him  of  murder  on  the 
ground  of  loss  of  control  because  he  personally  sensed  that  he  had  been  seriously 
wronged  in  circumstances  which  he  personally  regarded  as  extremely  grave.    The 
 
questions  whether  the  circumstances  were  extremely  grave,  and  whether  the 
defendant’s sense of grievance was justifiable, indeed all the requirements of section 
55(4)(a) and (b), require objective evaluation. 

The process of objective evaluation in each individual case is hugely complicated by 
 
the  prohibitions  in  section  55(6)  which  identifies  a  number  of  features  which  are 
expressly  excluded  from  consideration  as  qualifying  triggers.  Thus  the  defendant, 
who, looking for trouble to the extent of inciting or exciting violence loses his control, 
does not qualify.  In effect self induced loss of control will not run.  The most critical 
problem, however, which lies at the heart of the Clinton appeal, is subsection 6(c), 
“sexual infidelity”.   

This provision was described by Mr Andrew Edis QC, who acted for the prosecution 
in each of the appeals, as a “formidably difficult provision”: so indeed it is.  On the 
face  of  the  statutory  language,  however  grave  the  betrayal,  however  humiliating, 
indeed  however  provocative  in  the  ordinary  sense  of  the  word  it  may  be,  sexual 
infidelity is to be disregarded as a qualifying trigger.  Nevertheless, other forms of 
 
betrayal  or  humiliation  of  sufficient  gravity  may  fall  within  the  qualifying  triggers 
 
specified in section 55(4).  What, therefore, is the full extent of the prohibition?

R – v - Clinton, Parker & Evans 

 

 

15.	  We highlight some of the matters raised in argument to illustrate some of the potential 
problems.  This list is not comprehensive.  The forensic analysis could have gone on 
much longer, and so, for that matter, could this judgment.   

 

16.	  We  immediately  acknowledge  that  the  exclusion  of  sexual  infidelity  as  a  potential 
qualifying trigger is consistent with the concept of the autonomy of each individual. 
  
Of  course,  whatever  the  position  may  have  been  in  times  past,  it  is  now  clearly 
understood,  and  in  the  present  context  the  law  underlines,  that  no  one  (male  or 
female) owns or possesses his or her spouse or partner.  Nevertheless daily experience 
in both criminal and family courts demonstrates that the breakdown of relationships, 
whenever  they  occur,  and  for  whatever  reason,  is  always  fraught  with  tension  and 
difficulty,  with  the  possibility  of  misunderstanding  and  the  potential  for  apparently 
irrational  fury.    Meanwhile  experience  over  many  generations  has  shown  that, 
however it may become apparent, when it does, sexual infidelity has the potential to 
create a highly emotional situation or to exacerbate a fraught situation, and to produce 
a completely unpredictable, and sometimes violent response.  This may have nothing 
to do with any notional “rights” that the one may believe that he or she has over the 
other, and often stems from a sense of betrayal and heartbreak, and crushed dreams.   

 

17.	  Mr  Birnbaum  drew  attention  to  and  adopted  much  of  the  illuminating  and  critical 
commentary  by  Professor  Ormerod  at  pp.520-522  in  Smith  and  Hogan’s  Criminal 
 
Law.  To begin with, there is no definition of “sexual infidelity”.  Who and what is 
embraced in this concept?  Is sexual infidelity to be construed narrowly so as to refer 
only to conduct which is related directly and exclusively to sexual activity?  Only the 
words and acts constituting sexual activity are to be disregarded: on one construction, 
 
therefore, the effects are not.  What acts relating to infidelity, but distinguishable from 
it on the basis that they are not “sexual”, may be taken into account?  Is the provision 
directly  concerned  with  sexual 
jealousy  and 
possessiveness, the sort of obsession that leads to violence against the victim on the 
basis expressed in the sadly familiar language, “if I cannot have him/her, then no one 
else will/can”?  The notion of infidelity appears to involve a relationship between the 
 
two people to which one party may be unfaithful.  Is a one-night-stand sufficient for 
this purpose? 
   

infidelity,  or  with  envy  and 

 
18.	 

Take a case like R v Stingel [1990] 171 CLR 312, an Australian case where a jealous 
stalker,  who  stabbed  his  quarry  when  he  found  her,  on  his  account,  having  sexual 
 
intercourse.    He  does  not  face  any  difficulty  with  this  element  of  the  offence,  just 
because,  so  far  as  the  stalker  was  concerned,  there  was  no  sexual  infidelity  by  his 
victim at all.  Is the jealous spouse to be excluded when the stalker is not?  In R v 
Tabeel Lewis … an 18 year old Jehovah’s Witness killed his lover, a 63 year old co-
religionist, because on one view, he was ashamed of the consequences, if she carried 
out her threat to reveal their affair to the community.  She was not sexually unfaithful 
 
to him, but he killed her because he feared that she would betray him, not sexually, 
but by revealing their secret.  Mr Birnbaum asked rhetorically, why should the law 
exclude one kind of betrayal by a lover but not another? 
 

 

19.	  Mr Edis agreed that “sexual infidelity” is not defined.  He suggested that its ambit is 
not confined to “adultery” and that no marriage or civil partnership ceremony or any 
formal arrangement is required to render the violent reaction of the defendant to the 
 
sexual  infidelity  of  the  deceased  impermissible  for  the  purposes  of  a  qualifying 
 
trigger.  He suggested however that the concept of “infidelity” involves a breach of

mutual understanding which is to be inferred within the relationship, as well as any of 
the more obvious expressions of fidelity, such as those to be found in the marriage 
vows.  Notwithstanding  their  force,  these  considerations  do  not  quite  address  the 
 
specific requirement that the infidelity to be disregarded must be “sexual” infidelity. 
 
The problem was illustrated when Mr Edis postulated the example of a female victim 
who decided to end a relationship and made clear to her former partner that it was at 
an end, and whether expressly or by implication, that she regarded herself as free to 
have  sexual  intercourse  with  whomsoever  she  wanted.    After  the  end  of  the 
relationship, any such sexual activity could not sensibly be called “infidelity”.   If so, 
 
for the purposes of any qualifying trigger, it would not be caught by the prohibition in 
section 55(6)(c).  In such a case the exercise of what Mr Edis  described as her sexual 
freedom might possibly be taken into account in support of the defence, if she was 
killed by her former partner, whereas, if notwithstanding her disillusionment with it, 
she  had  attempted  to  keep  the  relationship  going,  while  from  time  to  time  having 
intercourse with others, it could not.    

  

 

 

20.	  Mr Birnbaum and Mr Edis could readily have identified a large number of situations 
 
arising  in  the  real  world  which,  as  a  result  of  the  statutory  provision,  would  be 
productive of surprising anomalies. We cannot resolve them in advance.  Whatever 
 
the anomalies to which it may give rise, the statutory provision is unequivocal: loss of 
control triggered by sexual infidelity cannot, on its own, qualify as a trigger for the 
purposes  of  the  second  component  of  this  defence.    This  is  the  clear  effect  of  the 
 
legislation. 

The  question  however  is  whether  it  is  a  consequence  of  the  legislation  that  sexual 
infidelity is similarly excluded when it may arise for consideration in the context of 
 
another  or  a  number  of  other  features  of  the  case  which  are  said  to  constitute  an 
appropriate permissible qualifying trigger.  The issue is complex. 

To assist in its resolution, Mr Edis drew attention to the formal guidance issued by the 
Crown Prosecution Service on this issue.  This provides that “it is the issue of sexual 
infidelity that falls to be disregarded under sub-section (6)(c).  However certain parts 
of the case may still amount to a defence under section 55(4)”.  The example is given 
of  the  defendant  who  kills  her  husband  because  he  has  raped  her  sister  (an  act  of 
sexual infidelity). In such a case the act of sexual infidelity may be disregarded and 
her actions may constitute a qualifying trigger under section 55(4). 

This example is interesting as far as it goes, and we understand it to mean that the 
context  in  which  sexual  infidelity  may  arise  may  be  relevant  to  the  existence  of  a 
 
qualifying trigger, but in truth it is too easy.  Any individual who witnesses a rape 
may  well  suffer  temporary  loss  of  control  in  circumstances  in  which  a  qualifying 
 
trigger  might  well  be  deemed  to  be  present,  although  in  the  case  of  a  rape  of  a 
stranger,  insufficient  to  cause  the  defendant  to  have  a  sense  of  being  seriously 
wronged  personally.  A  much  more  formidable  and  difficult  example  would  be  the 
defendant  who  kills  her  husband  when  she  suddenly  finds  him  having  enthusiastic, 
 
consensual  sexual  intercourse  with  her  sister.    Taken  on  its  own,  the  effect  of  the 
legislation is that any loss of control consequent on such a gross betrayal would be 
totally excluded from consideration as a qualifying trigger. Let us for the purposes of 
 
argument  take  the  same  example  a  little  further.    The  defendant  returns  home 
 
unexpectedly  and  finds  her  spouse  or  partner  having  consensual  sexual  intercourse 
 
with her sister (or indeed with anyone else), and entirely reasonably, but vehemently,

R – v - Clinton, Parker & Evans 

 

complains about what has suddenly confronted her.  The response by the unfaithful 
spouse or partner, and/or his or her new sexual companion, is to justify what he had 
been doing, by shouting and screaming,  mercilessly  taunting and deliberately using 
hurtful language which implies that she, not he, is responsible for his infidelity. The 
taunts  and  distressing  words,  which  do  not  themselves  constitute  sexual  infidelity, 
would  fall  to  be  considered  as  a  possible  qualifying  trigger.  The  idea  that,  in  the 
search for a qualifying trigger, the context in which such words are used should be 
ignored represents an artificiality which the administration of criminal justice should 
 
do  without.  And  if  the  taunts  by  the  unfaithful  partner  suggested  that  the  sexual 
activity  which  had  just  been  taking  place  was  infinitely  more  gratifying  than  any 
earlier sexual relationship with the defendant, are those insults – in effect using sexual 
infidelity to cause deliberate distress - to be ignored?  On the view of the legislation 
 
advanced  for  our  consideration  by  Mr  Edis,  they  must  be.    Yet,  in  most  criminal 
cases, as our recent judgment in the context of the riots and public order demonstrates, 
context is critical. 

 

 

24.	  We considered the example of the wife who has been physically abused over a long 
period, and whose loss of self control was attributable to yet another beating by her 
husband,  but  also,  for  the  first  time,  during  the  final  beating,  taunts  of  his  sexual 
activities with another woman or other women.  And so, after putting up with years of 
violent ill-treatment, what in reality finally caused the defendant’s loss of control was 
hurtful language boasting of his sexual infidelity.  Those words were the final straw. 
   
Mr  Edis  invited  us  to  consider  (he  did  not  support  the  contention)  whether,  on  a 
 
narrow interpretation of the statutory structure, if evidence to that effect were elicited 
(as  it  might,  in  cross-examination),  there  would  then  be  no  sufficient  qualifying 
trigger at all.  Although the persistent beating might in a different case fall within the 
provisions  for  qualifying  triggers  in  section  55(4)(a)  and  (b),  in  the  case  we  are 
considering, the wife had endured the violence and would have continued to endure it 
 
but  for  the  sudden  discovery  of  her  husband’s  infidelity.    On  this  basis  the  earlier 
history of violence, as well as the violence on the instant occasion, would not, without 
reference  to  the  claims  of  sexual  infidelity,  carry  sufficient  weight  to  constitute  a 
 
qualifying trigger. Yet in the real world the husband’s conduct over the years, and the 
impact of what he said on the particular occasion when he was killed, should surely be 
 
considered as a whole. 

 

  

25.	  We  addressed  the  same  issue  in  discussion  about  the  impact  of  the  words  “things 
said”  within  subsection  55(6)(c).    Everyone  can  understand  how  a  thing  done  may 
constitute  sexual  infidelity,  but  this  argument  revolved  around  finding  something 
“said” which “constituted” sexual infidelity.  Mr Edis accepted that no utterance, as 
such, could constitute sexual infidelity, at any rate as narrowly construed.  Professor 
 
Ormerod suggests the example of a defendant hearing a wife say to her lover, “I love 
you”.  On  close  examination,  this  may  or  may  not  provide  evidence  of  sexual 
 
infidelity.  However it does not necessarily “constitute” it, and whether it does or not 
depends  on  the  relationship  between  the  parties,  and  the  person  by  whom  and  to 
whom and the circumstances in which the endearment is spoken. It may constitute a 
 
betrayal  without  any  sexual  contact  or  intention.    Mr  Birnbaum  raised  another 
question.  He pointed out that in the case of Clinton, Mrs Clinton confessed to having 
had an affair on the day before she was killed, but earlier she boasted that she had had 
sex with five men. If the boast, intended to hurt, was simply untrue, how could those 
words “constitute” infidelity?
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R – v - Clinton, Parker & Evans 

 

 

 

 
26.	  We are required to make sense of this provision.   It would be illogical for a defendant 
to  be  able  to  rely  on  an  untrue  statement  about  the  victim’s  sexual  infidelity  as  a 
qualifying  trigger  in  support  of  the  defence,  but  not  on  a  truthful  one.    Equally,  it 
would be quite unrealistic to limit its ambit to words spoken to his or her lover by the 
unfaithful  spouse  or  partner  during  sexual  activity.    In  our  judgment  things  “said” 
includes admissions of sexual infidelity (even if untrue) as well as reports (by others) 
of sexual infidelity.  Such admissions or reports will rarely if ever be uttered without a 
context, and almost certainly a painful one.  In short, the words will almost invariably 
be spoken as part of a highly charged discussion in which many disturbing comments 
 
will be uttered, often on both sides. 

 

27.	  We must briefly return to the second example suggested by Professor Ormerod, that is 
the defendant telling his spouse or partner that he or she loves someone else.  As we 
have said, this may or may not provide evidence of sexual infidelity.  But it is entirely 
reasonable to assume that, faced with such an assertion, the defendant will ask who it 
is, and is likely to go on to ask whether they have already had an affair.  If the answer 
 
is “no” there would not appear to be any sexual infidelity.  If the answer is “yes”, then 
 
obviously there has been.  If the answer is “no”, but it is perfectly obvious that the 
 
departing spouse intends to begin a full relationship with the new partner, would that 
constitute sexual infidelity?  And is there a relevant distinction between the defendant 
who believes that a sexual relationship has already developed, and one who believes 
 
that it has not, but that in due course it will.  Situations arising from overhearing the 
 
other party to a relationship saying “I love you”, or saying to the defendant, “I love 
someone  else”,  simple  enough  words,  will  give  rise  to  manifold  difficulties  in  the 
context of the prohibition on sexual infidelity as a qualifying trigger.   

 
28.	 

This discussion of the impact of the statutory prohibition in section 55(6)(c)  arises, 
we emphasise, in the context, not of an academic symposium, but a trial process in 
which the defendant will be entitled to give evidence.  There is no prohibition on the 
defendant  telling  the  whole  story  about  the  relevant  events,  including  the  fact  and 
impact of sexual infidelity.  To the contrary: this evidence will have to be considered 
and evaluated by the jury.  That is because notwithstanding that sexual infidelity must 
 
be  disregarded  for  the  purposes  of  the  second  component  if  it  stands  alone  as  a 
 
qualifying trigger, for the reasons which follow it is plainly relevant to any questions 
which arise in the context of the third component, and indeed to one of the alternative 
defences to murder, as amended in the 2009 Act, diminished responsibility. 

 

29.	  We shall return to the question whether, notwithstanding that it must be disregarded if 
it is the only qualifying trigger, a thing done or said which constitutes sexual infidelity 
is  properly  available  for  consideration  in  the  course  of  evaluating  any  qualifying 
 
trigger which is not otherwise prohibited by the legislation. 

The third component 

Assuming that the qualifying trigger is present, the defence is still not complete.  We 
 
must return from section 55 to section 54 (1)(c).  This third ingredient is related to the 
 
requirement,  that  even  faced  with  situations  which  may  amount  to  a  qualifying 
 
trigger, the defendant is nevertheless expected to exercise a degree of self control. For 
 
this purpose the age and sex of the defendant is relevant.  Perhaps a very immature 
defendant will be less likely to be able to exercise the self control which might be 
exercised by an adult.  The defendant’s reaction (that is what he actually did, rather 

 
30.
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R – v - Clinton, Parker & Evans 

 

 
31.	 

than the fact that he lost his self control) may therefore be understandable in the sense 
that another person in his situation and the circumstances in which he found himself, 
 
might have reacted in the same or in a similar way.     

For present purposes the most significant feature of the third component is that the 
impact on the defendant of sexual infidelity is not excluded.  The exclusion in section 
55(6)(c) is limited to the assessment of the qualifying trigger.  In relation to the third 
component, that is the way in which the defendant has reacted and lost control, “the 
circumstances”  are  not  constrained  or  limited.    Indeed,  section  54(3)  expressly 
provides  that  reference  to  the  defendant’s  circumstances  extends  to  “all”  of  the 
circumstances  except  those  bearing  on  his  general  capacity  for  tolerance  and  self-
restraint.  When  the  third  component  of  the  defence  is  examined  it  emerges  that, 
notwithstanding section 55(6)(c), account may, and in an appropriate case, should be 
 
taken of sexual infidelity. 

 

32.	  We must reflect briefly on the directions to be given by the judge to the jury.  On one 
 
view  they  would  require  the  jury  to  disregard  any  evidence  relating  to  sexual 
infidelity  when  they  are  considering  the  second  component  of  the  defence,  yet, 
notwithstanding  this  prohibition,  would  also  require  the  same  evidence  to  be 
 
addressed  if  the  third  component  arises  for  consideration.  In  short,  there  will  be 
 
occasions  when  the  jury  would  be  both  disregarding  and  considering  the  same 
evidence.  That is, to put it neutrally, counter intuitive. 

 

 

Diminished responsibility 

 
33.	 

The situation for the jury, and the judge, is yet further complicated if and when, as 
sometimes happens, the defence is inviting the jury to consider possible verdicts of 
manslaughter both on the grounds of loss of control and diminished responsibility.  If 
the defendant is suffering from a recognised medical condition, for example, serious 
and chronic depression, the discovery that a partner has been sexually unfaithful may, 
and often will be said to, impair the defendant’s ability to form a rational judgment 
 
and exercise self control.  This situation is not all that uncommon.  It arose in Clinton 
where one of the psychiatrists suggested that if Clinton was telling the truth, the effect 
of his “depressed state” would have been that he would have been more likely to lose 
self control following his wife’s graphic account of sexual activity with other men and 
her  taunts  that  he  lacked  the  courage  to  commit  suicide.  Sexual  infidelity  may 
therefore  require  consideration  when  the  jury  is  examining  the  diminished 
responsibility  defence  even  when  it  has  been  excluded  from  consideration  as  a 
qualifying trigger for the purposes of the loss of control defence.   

Sexual infidelity – conclusion 

 

34.	  We must now address the full extent of the prohibition against “sexual infidelity” as a 
qualifying  trigger  for  the  purposes  of  the  loss  of  control  defence.    The  question  is 
whether or not sexual infidelity is wholly excluded from consideration in the context 
of features of the individual case which constitute a permissible qualifying trigger or 
triggers within section 55(3) and (4).
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R – v - Clinton, Parker & Evans 

 

 

35.	  We have examined the legislative structure as a whole.  The legislation was designed 
 
to prohibit the misuse of sexual infidelity as a potential trigger for loss of control in 
circumstances in which it was thought to have been misused in the former defence of 
provocation.  Where  there  is  no  other  potential  trigger,  the  prohibition  must, 
notwithstanding the difficulties identified earlier in the judgment, be applied.  

The starting point is that it has been recognised for centuries that sexual infidelity may 
produce a loss of control in men, and, more recently in women as well as men who 
are confronted with sexual infidelity.  The exclusion created by section 55(6) cannot 
and does not eradicate the fact that on occasions sexual infidelity and loss of control 
are linked, often with the one followed immediately by the other.  Indeed on one view 
if  it  did  not  recognise  the  existence  of  this  link,  the  policy  decision  expressly  to 
exclude sexual infidelity as a qualifying trigger would be unnecessary.   

In section 54(1)(c) and (3) the legislation further acknowledges the impact of sexual 
infidelity as a potential ingredient of the third component of the defence, when all the 
defendant’s  circumstances  fall  for  consideration,  and  when,  although  express 
provision is made for the exclusion of some features of the defendant’s situation, the 
 
fact that he/she has been sexually betrayed is not.  In short, sexual infidelity is not 
subject to a blanket exclusion when the loss of control defence is under consideration. 
 
Evidence  of  these  matters  may  be  deployed  by  the  defendant  and  therefore  the 
legislation proceeds on the basis that sexual infidelity is a permissible feature of the 
loss of control defence. 

The ambit of section 55(3) and (4) – the second component, the qualifying triggers – 
is clearly defined.  Any qualifying trigger is subject to clear statutory criteria.  Dealing 
with  it  broadly,  to  qualify  as  a  trigger  for  the  defendant’s  loss  of  control,  the 
circumstances  must  be  extremely  grave  and  the  defendant  must  be  subject  to  a 
justifiable sense of having been seriously wronged.  These are fact specific questions 
 
requiring careful assessment, not least to ensure that the loss of control defence does 
not  have  the  effect  of  minimising  the  seriousness  of  the  infliction  of  fatal  injury. 
 
Objective evaluation is required and a judgment must be made about the gravity of the 
 
circumstances  and  the  extent  to  which  the  defendant  was  seriously  wronged,  and 
whether he had a justifiable sense that he had been seriously wronged. 

Our approach has, as the judgment shows, been influenced by the simple reality that 
in relation to the day to day working of the criminal justice system events cannot be 
 
isolated from their context.  We have provided a number of examples in the judgment. 
  
Perhaps expressed most simply, the man who admits, “I killed him accidentally”, is 
never to be treated as if he had said “I killed him”.  That would be absurd.  It may not 
be  unduly  burdensome  to  compartmentalise  sexual  infidelity  where  it  is  the  only 
element relied on in support of a qualifying trigger, and, having compartmentalised it 
in  this  way,  to  disregard  it.    Whether  this  is  so  or  not,  the  legislation  imposes  that 
exclusionary obligation on the court.  However, to seek to compartmentalise sexual 
 
infidelity and exclude it when it is integral to the facts as a whole is not only much 
more difficult, but is unrealistic and carries with it the potential for injustice.  In the 
examples  we  have  given  earlier  in  this  judgment,  we  do  not  see  how  any  sensible 
evaluation of the gravity of the circumstances or their impact on the defendant could 
be made if the jury, having, in accordance with the legislation, heard the evidence, 
were then to be directed to excise from their evaluation of the qualifying trigger the 
matters said to constitute sexual infidelity, and to put them into distinct compartments

to be disregarded.  In our judgment, where sexual infidelity is integral to and forms an 
essential part of the context in which to make a just evaluation whether a qualifying 
trigger  properly falls within the ambit of  subsections 55(3) and (4), the prohibition in 
section 55(6)(c) does not operate to exclude it. 

 

 

40.	  We have proceeded on the assumption that legislation is not enacted with the intent or 
 
purpose that the criminal justice system should operate so as to create injustice.  We 
 
are fortified in this view by the fact that, although the material did not assist in the 
construction of section 55(6)(c), our conclusion is consistent not only with the views 
expressed in Parliament by those who were opposed in principle to the enactment of 
section 55(6)(c) but also with the observations of ministers who supported this limb of 
the legislation. 

 
41.	 

 
42.	 

Thus,  for  example,  on  3  March  2009,  Angela Eagle, speaking for the Government, 
said  that  the  Government  did  not  believe  that  “sexual  infidelity  ought  to  be  a 
sufficient reason to reduce a murder charge to a finding of manslaughter … we do not 
 
accept that that itself ought to lead to reducing a murder finding …” (our emphasis).   

 

 

On  9  November  2009,  Claire  Ward,  speaking  for  the  Government,  said  that  the 
Government did not think it appropriate in this day and age “for a man to be able to 
say that he killed his wife as a result of sexual infidelity … if other factors come into 
play, the court will of course have an opportunity to consider them, but it will not be 
able to make the decision exclusively on the ground of sexual infidelity”. Answering a 
later question, she observed that the court would not be able to “take into account a 
set of circumstances in which the defendant killed someone in an attempt to punish … 
them or carry out some form of revenge purely as a result of sexual infidelity”.  Later 
still she said   “We are simply saying that sexual infidelity in itself cannot and should 
not  be  …  a  defence  for  murder”.    Yet  later  she  spoke  of  how  important  it  was  in 
relation to sexual infidelity “to set out the position precisely and uncompromisingly – 
namely that sexual infidelity is not the kind of thing done that is ever sufficient on its 
own to found a successful plea of loss of control”.  Later she observed:  “If something 
else is relied on as the qualifying trigger, any sexual infidelity that forms part of the 
background can be considered, but it cannot be the trigger”. (Our emphasis). This was 
the consistent pattern of her observations. 

 
43.	 

In the House of Lords, Lord Bach on 26 October 2009, speaking for the Government, 
invited opponents of the prohibition in section 55(6)(c) to explain “why they consider 
that, when one person kills another, the fact that the deceased had been unfaithful to 
their killer should ever be enough …”.  Shortly afterwards, on 11 November 2009, he 
 
suggested that opponents of the provision were implicitly arguing that the defendant 
 
“should  be  able  to  make  out  a  partial  defence  based  on  sexual  infidelity,  in  and  of 
 
itself, on the part of the victim.  We simply do not agree…” (Our emphasis.) 

 
44.	 

Our approach to the legislative structure is entirely consistent with these responses.   

The responsibilities of the judge 

(a) at the conclusion of the evidence 

 
45.	 

One of the responsibilities the trial judge in the context of the new defence is defined. 
 
Unless  there  is  evidence  sufficient  to  raise the  issue  of  loss  of  control  it  should  be

R – v - Clinton, Parker & Evans 

 

withdrawn  from  consideration  by  the  jury.    If  there  is,  then  the  prosecution  must 
disprove  it.  In  this  context  “sufficient  evidence”  is  explained  by  reference  to  well 
understood principles, that is, that a properly directed jury could “reasonably conclude 
 
that  the  defence  might  apply”.    In  reaching  this  decision  the  judge  is  required  to 
 
address the ingredients of the defence, as defined in section 54 and further amplified 
in section 55.  There must be sufficient evidence to establish each of the ingredients 
defined  in  subsections  54(1)(a),(b)  and  (c),  and  this  carries  with  it,  evidence  which 
 
satisfies the test in subsections 55(4)(a) and (b). In making the decision in accordance 
with  the  principles  identified  in  this  judgment  the  judge  must  exclude  the  specific 
matters  which  might  otherwise  be  regarded  as  constituting  possible  justification  in 
section  55(c)(b)  and  the  express  conditions  to  be  disregarded  in  accordance  with 
 
section  55(6)(a)  and  (c).  In  the  end  however,  although  the  judge  must  bear  these 
different features in mind when deciding whether the case should be left to the jury, 
and  the  task  is  far  from  straightforward,  these  statutory  provisions  reflect  well 
established principles summarised in the phrase “the evidential burden”.  Sufficient 
evidence  must  be  adduced  to  enable  the  judgment  to  be  made  that  a  jury  could 
reasonably  decide  that  the  prosecution  had  failed  to  negate  the  defence  of  loss  of 
control. 

This requires a common sense judgment based on an analysis of all the evidence.  To 
the extent that the evidence may be in dispute, the judge has to recognise that the jury 
may accept the evidence which is most favourable to the defendant, and reject that 
which is most favourable to the prosecution, and so tailor the ruling accordingly.  That 
 
is  merely  another  way  of  saying  that  in  discharging  this  responsibility  the  judge 
 
should not reject disputed evidence which the jury might choose to believe.  Guiding 
himself  or  herself  in  this  way,  the  more  difficult  question  which  follows  is  the 
 
judgment  whether  the  circumstances  were  sufficiently  grave  and  whether  the 
defendant had a justifiable grievance because he had been seriously wronged.  These 
are  value  judgments.    They  are  left  to  the  jury  when  the  judge  concludes  that  the 
evidential burden has been satisfied. 

 
46.	 

 

47.	  When exercising these responsibilities, the judge is not, where there is no sufficient 
 
evidence to leave the loss of control defence to the jury, directing a conviction in the 
sense prohibited in Wang [2005] 1WLR 66.  The statutory provision is clear.  If there 
is  evidence  on  which  the  jury  could  reasonably  conclude  that  the  loss  of  control 
 
defence might apply, it must be left to the jury: if there is no such evidence, then it 
must  be  withdrawn.  Thereafter  in  accordance  with  the  judge’s  directions  the  jury 
will consider and return its verdict. 

 

 
48.	 

The appeals of Clinton and Parker highlight these difficulties.  In Clinton the defence 
was not left to the jury and it is argued that it should have been.  In Parker the defence 
 
was  left  to  the  jury,  and  certainly  had  the  prosecution  suggested  that  the  defence 
 
should be withdrawn, the judge might have felt it necessary to withdraw it from the 
 
jury. 

(b) The Summing Up 

Confining ourselves to the second component (the qualifying trigger or triggers under 
section 55), for the reasons already given, if the only potential qualifying trigger is 
sexual  infidelity,  effect  must  be  given  to  the  legislation.    There  will  then  be  no 
 
qualifying  trigger,  and  the  judge  must  act  accordingly.    The  more  problematic 

 
49.

situations will arise when the defendant relies on an admissible trigger (or triggers) 
for which sexual infidelity is said to provide an appropriate context (as explained in 
this judgment) for evaluating whether the trigger relied on is a qualifying trigger for 
the purposes of subsection 55(3) and (4).  When this situation arises the jury should be 
 
directed: 

 
a)	 

 
b)	 

 
c)	 

 
d)	 

 
e)	 

as  to  the  statutory  ingredients  required  of  the  qualifying  trigger  or 
triggers; 

as  to  the  statutory  prohibition  against  sexual  infidelity  on  its  own 
 
constituting a qualifying trigger; 

as to the features identified by the defence (or which are apparent to the 
trial judge) which are said to constitute a permissible trigger or triggers; 

that,  if  these  are  rejected  by  the  jury,  in  accordance  with  (b)  above 
sexual infidelity must then be disregarded; 

that  if,  however,  an  admissible  trigger  may  be  present,  the  evidence 
 
relating  to  sexual  infidelity  arises  for  consideration  as  part  of  the 
context  in  which  to  evaluate  that  trigger  and  whether  the  statutory 
 
ingredients identified in (a) above may be established. 

Jon-Jacques Clinton 

 

50.	  We shall summarise the facts very briefly, and then describe them in much greater 
 
detail.  Mr and Mrs Clinton had lived together for 16 years.  They had two children of 
school age.  They married in 2001.  Two weeks before her death, the appellant’s wife 
 
had left him and the children of the family as they   began what was described as a 
 
trial separation.  She went to live with her parents.  The couple continued to spend 
time  together  with  the  children  as  a  family,  and  their  mother  would  return  to  the 
family home to look after them on their return from school until the appellant returned 
home from work.   

 

 

51.	  Mrs Clinton spent time in the family home on Saturday 13th November, and they went 
swimming  and  ate  dinner  together  as  a  family  on  the  next  day.    On  that  day  Mrs 
Clinton told the appellant that she was having an affair.   

 
52.	 

That evening Mrs Clinton’s Land Rover or Jeep (her most treasured possession) was 
stolen from outside her parent’s home.  On the following morning it was found in a 
 
burnt out condition.  The jury was satisfied that the appellant was responsible for the 
removal and damage to the car.  He was contacted by the police on the morning when 
the vehicle was found.  He went over to see Mrs Clinton at her parent’s home to tell 
her of the incident, and during a brief visit, arrangements were made for her to return 
to the family home to collect insurance documents relating to the vehicle.  During the 
morning  the  appellant  consumed  drink  and  drugs,  including  a  large  amount  of 
Codeine and he searched websites containing material dealing with suicide. 
 

 

53.	  Mrs  Clinton  was  dropped  at  the  family  home  by  her  mother  at  about  14.00  hours. 
 
When her mother returned at 15.40 she found that the curtains were drawn and the 
 
door  was  barricaded.  Police  attended  at  about  17.10.    They  forced  the  front  door.

They found the body of Mrs Clinton on the living room floor semi naked.  She had 
obvious head injuries.  There was a ligature around her neck.  She was pronounced 
dead.  The appellant was found in the loft with a noose around his neck attached to the 
rafters. 

The deceased had been beaten about the head with a wooden baton, strangled with a 
 
belt, and then a piece of rope had been tightened around her neck with the aid of the 
wooden baton.  There were defensive injuries.  The cause of death was head injury 
and asphyxia caused by a ligature compression of the neck.  After he had killed her 
the appellant removed most of her clothes and having put her body into a number of 
different  poses,  took  photographs  of  it  and  then  sent  text  messages  to  Mr 
Montgomery, the man with whom she was having a relationship. 

The prosecution case was that the appellant had set fire to the Land Rover out of spite 
and then, incensed when he found out that she was conducting an affair with another 
man, he had confronted her at the family home in the afternoon of 15th November. He 
 
had planned to kill her before she arrived at the house and had made preparations to 
do so.  During the confrontation he beat her and strangled her to death.  At a plea and 
case management hearing the appellant pleaded guilty to manslaughter, but not guilty 
to murder.  Although responsible for his wife’s death, either on the basis of “loss of 
control” or “diminished responsibility”, he was not guilty of murder.   

56.	  We shall narrate the facts in more detail. 

 

By  the  autumn  of  2010  the  couple  were  seriously  overdrawn  at  the  bank  and 
dependent on Mrs Clinton’s earnings once the overdraft limit had been reached, as it 
normally was, by the middle of the month.  The appellant had a history of depression 
for which he was prescribed medication and Mrs Clinton herself was prescribed anti-
depressants.  Their teenage children gave evidence of some of the tensions between 
them.    By  mid-September  2010,  via  Facebook,  Mrs  Clinton  had  come  to  know 
another man.  A relationship developed between them.   

In early November Mrs Clinton moved out of the family home to the home of her 
 
mother,  leaving  the  children  in  the  family  home.    After  her  departure  there  was 
evidence  that  the  appellant’s  behaviour  became  more  erratic.  The  appellant  was 
 
desperate for his marriage to work, and eventually become “obsessional” about it.  He 
mentioned to the mutual friend on 12th November in an email his suspicions that his 
wife was having an affair.  She was worried that he would try and kill himself.  On 
13th November he indicated that his son had told him that his wife had put an entry on 
her Facebook page which read “bollocks to it all”.  On the following day they went 
swimming  together  and  that  evening  the  vehicle  was  stolen  from  outside  Mrs 
Clinton’s  mother’s  home.    The  following  morning  it  was  found,  significantly 
damaged.  The appellant expressed concerns about how his wife would react to the 
news of the fire.  Together with a police officer he went to her mother’s home and 
saw her.  He did not apologise for what had happened to the vehicle and, as we know, 
he was later to insist that he was not responsible.  The evidence suggested that the 
appellant appeared to be concerned and gave his wife a hug. Indeed her mother said 
that he was all over her like a rash and kissing her, but, as her mother could see from 
 
her reaction, she did not want him.

Following  earlier  searches  of  suicide  websites  at  the  end  of  October,  the  appellant 
recommenced  his  searches  on  14th  November  continuing  them  through  to  the  15th. 
Among the searches shown in a schedule before the jury there were entries referring 
to “sleeping pills” and “how to hang yourself” and “the best suicide methods”.   From 
early in the morning of 15th November he also accessed various sites including sites 
on which he and his wife had formerly posted photographs of themselves, his wife’s 
 
Facebook site, and a website which had been set up by Mr Montgomery called “Fast 
as Fuck”.  At 12.10 he visited his wife’s Facebook site and at about 12.30 he returned 
to look at suicide sites. At 12.58 on 15th November the appellant received a telephone 
 
call from his wife which lasted just over 1 minute 30 seconds.  At 13.12 he composed 
a “note to everyone”.  The Crown suggested that it showed an intention to kill himself 
 
and his wife, but his case was that it was a suicide note.  At 13.31 he texted the mutual 
friend to say that he had asked his wife to come round “so we could tell the kids two 
bits of bad news”.  He said that he had been drinking and had had a very bad night’s 
sleep.  His voice was shaking and he sounded shattered and exhausted.  She told him 
to calm down.  He said that they would tell the children that the separation would be 
permanent.  He was expecting his wife to arrive at 2 o’clock.   

 
60.	 

At  13.07  Mrs  Clinton  sent  a  text  message  to  the  appellant  asking  him  to  text  the 
children to let them know he would collect them from school.  He did this at 13.10. 

 

61.	  Mrs Clinton’s mother dropped her off at the family home at about 2pm.  At 14.24 the 
appellant sent a message to his daughter telling her that there had been a change of 
plan  and  they  were  to  go  to  their  Grandmother’s  house.    At  14.42  an  unanswered 
telephone  call  was  made  from  Mrs  Clinton’s  mobile  phone  to  a  man  called  Nick 
 
whose number was stored in her “contacts list” and text was sent to Mr Montgomery 
at 14.47 and 14.49 which read respectively “Cunt” and “It’s over”.  At 15.20 a further 
text message from Mrs Clinton’s phone to Mr Montgomery comprised a jumble of 
letters which made no sense.  By not later than 14.51 Mrs Clinton was dead.  At that 
time and again at 14.59 explicit photographs of her naked body had been taken on her 
 
mobile phone.  All this material was relied on in support of the Crown’s case that the 
appellant was acting out of a desire for revenge. 

 

Following  the  visit  by  Mrs  Clinton’s  mother  to  the  family  home  at  about  3.40  the 
 
police were called and in due course forced the front door.  They found Mrs Clinton’s 
 
body in the living room.  We have described her injuries.  They found the appellant in 
the loft with a rope round his neck attached to the rafters.  He said “it’s the voices in 
my head”.  His voice was slurred.  He said he had been drinking all day.  He said his 
children’s names were “cunt and cunt”.  Following his arrest he told a doctor that he 
had taken 22 Cocodemal and 15 Phenagan tablets and that he wished he was dead.  A 
subsequent toxicology report suggested that the drugs had been taken after the death 
of the deceased. 

On  “loss  of  control”  the  appellant’s  evidence  was  critical.    After  dealing  with 
background  matters  he  said  that  from  the  end  of  2009  financial  difficulties  had 
imposed a strain on the relationship between him and his wife.  From March 2010 her 
interest  in  him  and  their  children  dwindled  and  he  suggested  that  she  had  become 
 
“tarty” and “slutty” in her behaviour and there was increasing tension at home.  He 
 
himself  was  much  less  tolerant  and  often  angry.    He  had  lost  his  libido.    He  felt  a 
 
failure at work and was prone to tears.  He suffered depression.  He saw his doctor, 
and  after  taking  medication,  there  was  some  improvement  in  the  relationship.

However by September she was drawing away from him and becoming angry with 
the children.  At work things were “ramping up”. 

On 30th October Mrs Clinton told him she needed time out.  They agreed on a trial 
 
 
separation for 4 weeks.  He had searched suicide sites and was contemplating suicide 
as one option, and later “it became more serious”, although by 14th November he still 
 
had some hope.  When cross-examined he explained that Mrs Clinton had caught him 
looking at suicide sites and told him not to be stupid.  She would only be gone for a 
month.  She  said  that  she  needed  time  out  of  the  relationship.    She  had  been 
prescribed anti-depressant tablets herself.   

On 13th November they met and for the sake of the children discussed going to Relate.  
 
Although he didn’t think that she was genuine she had to go, and this gave him some 
hope.  On the 14th the family went swimming.  On their return to the family home he 
showed her a note he had written on his computer.  In the note he had said that he now 
knew that she would not be coming back which was something he had feared for a 
long time.  He expressed a fear about how he and the children would manage when 
 
she had gone.  He wrote “where will we live, how will we live”?  It went on, “there is 
so  much  underneath  in  both  of  us  just  bubbling  away  your  fear,  mine,  add  our 
finances, my bullying, the kids getting a bit older, you wanting freedom, me getting 
suspicious … a lot of it is my fault but we both had our parts to play.  We all need to 
move on now.  Don’t we?” 

He gave evidence that his wife told him about her affair.  When she did so, she was 
upset and crying, and they agreed to meet the next week to discuss how they would 
tell the children.  He realised that his marriage was over.  

 

On  15th  November  he  obtained  access  to  her  Facebook,  and  he  viewed  Mr 
Montgomery’s  website  via  a  link  from  her  website.    After  taking  the  children  to 
school  he  “tortured  himself”  by  looking  at  the  photographs  they  had  posted  on  the 
 
internet  site  and  he  visited  Mrs  Clinton’s  Facebook  site.    He  found  messages 
containing sexual innuendos.  She had made an entry on the date of their daughter’s 
 
birthday  in  February  about  wanting  to  be  “poked”.    Her  “status”  was  shown  as 
“separated” and “open to offers”.  At about 12.30 he looked at some sexual images 
   
which confirmed that Mrs Clinton had been unfaithful to him. 

 

 
By  the  time  she  arrived  at  the  family  home  at  about  14.00  he  had  taken  80mg  of 
Codeine and about a quarter of a bottle of brandy.  When she arrived he made a cup of 
 
tea.  They sat on the sofa in the living room.  She went to the kitchen for more milk 
and when she came back she was holding a piece of wood.  She said “did you fucking 
 
do that to Fred?”  They were both agitated.  She was tearful.  Although he knew what 
she  had  been  doing  he  asked  her  what  was  going  on  and  she  said  “there’s  nothing 
going on.  You’re fucking paranoid”.  He then touched the cursor on the laptop and 
looked at her Face book page and said “how could you do that at half term and go 
 
shagging other people?”  She became very spiteful and said “it should have been like 
 
that every day of the week” and that she had had sex with five different men.  She 
 
gave  details  about  the  sexual  activity  saying  that  they  had  come  inside  her.    The 
appellant said that this was deeply hurtful.   

 
69. 

 
She asked him whether he had done the damage to Fred.  He denied it.  She came 
back to the room holding a piece of wood, which was kept in the house, and she asked

R – v - Clinton, Parker & Evans 

 

again whether he’d damaged the car telling him to “tell me the truth now”.  He stood 
up and said “how dare you fucking talk to me about the truth”, and he took the piece 
of wood off her.  There was no struggle.  She had just been pointing it at him.  When 
he took it off her, that was quite easy.  He was angry and hurt when she asked him to 
tell the truth because “for months he had been asking her to tell him the truth of what 
was going on”.  He put the piece of wood down.  She sat down.  He went into the 
kitchen.  While she was sitting down she was still a little bit agitated and so was he, 
 
and, in effect, for distraction purposes, he asked how her mother’s shoulder was.   

  

They  were  sitting  on  the  sofa.  After  some  conversation  about  the  police  and  the 
 
vehicle he said “look we need to discuss things”.  He realised that the relationship was 
over.  To  say  he  was  quite  upset  was  an  understatement.    He  had  been  open  and 
honest with her, and he wanted her to be the same with him so that he could realise 
 
that it “wasn’t 17 years of a bloody sham”.  So he asked her, as he’d asked her many 
times before what was going on.  She said “nothing.  I’ve told you before, “it’s you, 
you’re fucking paranoid.  There is nothing going on.”  With that he touched the cursor 
thing on the laptop and it showed her Face book page through their son’s log in.  Her 
Face book page came up on the screen.  He said “well it’s all there, you know.  I’ve 
looked on it.  I know what you’ve been up to.  How could you leave them at half term, 
as you did, and go shagging other people leaving them?”  With that she became, “very 
spiteful”.  He had never seen her like that.  It was “like she was another person”.  She 
said either “it could have been” or “should have been everyday of the fucking week”. 
 
He took that to mean that there were “five different people, Monday to Friday”.  He 
went on “like I say, I’ve never, ever, ever, ever seen her behave like that.  She’s never 
– it was just pure – it was said with such pure hatred.  I can’t explain it”. 

At that point they stood up.  He was getting angry but he didn’t want a confrontation. 
He  wanted  “a  bit  of  open  honesty  so  that  he  could  make  sense  of  what  she  was 
throwing away, why we were throwing away 17 years of a relationship”. 

 

He  walked  towards  the  kitchen  thinking  that  he  would  calm  down  and  have  a 
cigarette.  He didn’t want the confrontation.  As he was walking towards the kitchen 
she turned round and “started giving me some graphic details of sexual acts that had, 
in the past, formed part of our kind of role play stuff, about other men, her with other 
 
men,  she  wanted  me  to  watch,  etc.  etc.  –  it  was  in  a  different  context  now  and  it 
 
wasn’t very nice, obviously, hearing your wife talking about up to 5 different people 
having sex with her.  I didn’t want to go into detail, but it was very very graphic”. 

He had never seen her like that before.  She was “almost in a rage”.  It seemed “to 
build up and up and up, it didn’t seem like she was going to stop this kind of thing.” 
  
“She was talking, more or less but in a much sort of gruffer, I guess deeper voice than 
she  would  do  normally.    So  it  wasn’t  really  a  shout,  but  it  was  –  I  mean  …  she 
 
obviously raised her voice as she was giving me the graphics of it”. 

He  was  asked  how  long  this  had  gone  on  for  and  he  said  that  he  couldn’t  rightly 
remember.  He went into the kitchen, and after pouring another brandy and coke, and 
perhaps  having  a  swig  of  Codeine  he  had  a  cigarette.    He  started  smoking  it.  He 
didn’t want to go back into the living room because his wife was angry and he could 
feel  that  he  was  getting  angry  too.    While  he  was  in  the  kitchen  there  was  no 
 
conversation.  He took control of himself to calm down.  He smoked a cigarette and 
had a drink to calm himself.

R – v - Clinton, Parker & Evans 

 

 

75.	  When he returned into the living room, there was some conversation about what they 
would  tell  the  children.  There  was  no  point  in  carrying  a  conversation  about  her 
infidelity, “as much as it hurt me, we needed to talk about the children”.  He told her 
that  he  was  scared  that  he  wouldn’t  have  enough  money  to  feed  them.    He  was 
concerned about finances.  She “sort of sighed” and said something like “it won’t be 
fucking easy for me either”.  He had never seen her talk like that before.  He said 
“How could you do that on your daughter’s birthday?”  He then realised he’s made a 
 
mistake  in  bringing  the  conversation  back  to  her  affairs,  but  he  probably  said  it  in 
response to her.  He heard her kind of snigger.  He was not looking at her and she was 
not looking at him.  He heard her snigger and “sought of almost like laugh”, and then 
she said “you haven’t got the fucking bollocks”.  I thought “what?” so I turned round 
and  looked.  “She’d  gone  on  to  one  of  the  pages  I’d  minimised,  suicide  sites,  the 
 
hanging rope”.  She then went on “it would have been easier if you had, for all of us”. 
 
He  never  ever  seen  “my  Dawnie  like  that”.    He  felt  “useless,  awful,  confused  and 
 
fearful.  And  then  she  became  very  angry  saying  that  she’d  done  her  bit  with  the 
children.  She said “I didn’t fucking sign up for this.  You have them.  You look after 
them”.  He said it was horrible. His wife was a different person “it was like she was 
 
somebody else”.  With that the walls and the ceiling just seemed to close in.  She was 
talking but he could not hear what she was saying.  He could see her mouth opening 
and closing.  He could hear a noise, like the distant sea.  He wanted everything to 
stop.  He  wanted  everything  to  slow  down.    He  then  reached  out  and  grabbed  the 
 
piece of wood.  The attack on her followed. 

At  the  conclusion  of  the  evidence  Judge  Smith  directed  herself  that  there  was  no 
evidence that the loss of self-control necessary for the purposes of this defence was 
due  to  one  of  the  qualifying  triggers  identified  in  the  statute.    She  was  required 
 
“specifically”  to  disregard  anything  said  or  done  that  constituted  sexual  infidelity. 
  
The remarks allegedly made by the wife, challenged about her infidelity, to the effect 
 
that she had intercourse with five men were to be ignored.  Removing that element of 
that evidence, what was left was the evidence when the wife saw that the appellant 
 
had visited the suicide site on the internet, she commented that he had “not the balls to 
commit suicide” and that she also said, so far as the future was concerned, that he 
could have the children who were then currently living with him at their home.  The 
judge  observed  that  she  could  not  see  that  the  circumstances  were  of  an  extremely 
grave character or that they would cause the defendant to have a justifiable sense of 
 
being seriously wrong.  On this issue no sufficient evidence had been adduced.  She 
 
could not find that a jury properly directed could reasonably conclude that the defence 
might  apply.    In  due  course  she  proceeded  to  her  summing  up,  leaving  diminished 
responsibility for the consideration of the jury. 

In addressing these problems, Judge Smith did not have the advantage of the careful 
and detailed submissions made to us by leading counsel on behalf of the appellant and 
the Crown.  On the basis that the remarks made by the wife had to be disregarded, her 
conclusion that the defence should be withdrawn from the jury was unassailable.  In 
context,  it  was  a  characteristically  courageous  decision.    For  the  reasons  we  have 
 
endeavoured  to  explain  in  this  judgment,  we  have  concluded  that  she  misdirected 
herself  about  the  possible  relevance  of  the  wife’s  infidelity.    We  have  reflected 
whether the totality of the matters relied on as a qualifying trigger, evaluated in the 
context  of  the  evidence  relating  to  the  wife’s  sexual  infidelity,  and  examined  as  a

cohesive whole, were of sufficient weight to leave to the jury.  In our judgment they 
were.  Accordingly the appeal against conviction will be allowed. 

 
78.	 

In the circumstances of this case, we shall order a new trial.  The issues should be 
 
examined by a jury. 

R v Steven Parker 
  

The appellant and his wife, Jane, were both in their mid twenties at the date of her 
death.  They had been in a relationship for some 10 years, and they were married for 
 
the last 4 years.  They had three children together. 

During their marriage the appellant had a number of affairs, and his wife had a brief 
sexual relationship with another man.  The appellant was unaware of this until after 
her death.  During the year prior to her death she had confided in close friends and 
family that she was unhappy in her marriage and was seeking to separate from the 
appellant.  She  planned  to  leave  him  after  the  October  half-term  holiday  in  2010, 
although she had not told the appellant. 

On  the  night  of  26th  October  2010  in  the  course  of  an  argument  between  them,  he 
 
 
inflicted what was described as a “fat lip” on her.  On the following afternoon while 
 
she was at an activity centre with her children, Mrs Parker sent a text message to the 
applicant who was at home.  Ignoring the text language it reads as follows: 

 
“I’m sorry, Steve.  I will always love you but you have hurt me 
too much now.  I’ve never forgived you for Claire, so think it’s 
 
time for us to separate.  Pack your stuff while I am here so kids 
don’t see it all.  And I’ll drop car off in a bit for you to put your 
stuff in and go.  Nothing you say or do will change my mind. 
x” 

 
On leaving the activity centre her brother-in-law accompanied her to the matrimonial 
home.  They arrived at the house between 15.54 and 15.58.  Mrs Parker went into the 
house.  The  appellant  locked  the  back  door.    Her  brother-in-law  was  told  to  wait 
outside.  Within a short period of her entering the house, the precise length of which 
was in dispute, Mrs Parker was attacked and repeatedly stabbed by the appellant.  Her 
brother-in-law heard her screams and broke into the house.  He wrestled the appellant 
off her and summoned the emergency services.  Paramedics and the police arrived.   

The deceased was found dead at the scene.  It later emerged that the deceased had 
suffered  53  separate  stab  wounds  to  the  body,  which  varied  in  severity,  but  also 
 
included 5 stab wounds to the neck, shoulder and face.  There were superficial incised 
and stab wounds to the body, with defence incised wounds to the hands.  The cause of 
death was blood loss from the stab wounds to the neck.   

The appellant was arrested outside the house.  After her brother-in-law had pulled him 
off Mrs Parker, he had become compliant with whatever he was told to do.  He waited 
outside for the emergency services and on a number of occasions said he was very 
sorry  for  what  had  happened.    He  had  scratches  the  length  of  his  left  arm  which 
appeared  to  be  self  inflicted,  and  a  heart  and  the  initials  JP  (his  wife’s  initials) 
scratched onto his chest.

R – v - Clinton, Parker & Evans 

 

Investigating  officers  recovered  a  letter  from  the  lounge  floor  addressed  to  Mrs 
Parker. In it the appellant declared his love and pleaded to her not to leave him.  An 
open family photograph album and photographs were found on the bed in an upstairs 
bedroom.    Two  knives  were  recovered  from  the  scene,  a  large  kitchen  knife  and  a 
shorter  knife,  the  tip  of  which  was  missing,  which  was  discovered  under  the 
deceased’s body. 

 

In interview the appellant exercised his right to silence.  He produced a prepared note 
which explained that his decision to do so was made on the basis of legal advice.  It is 
 
clear  from  the  tape  recording  that  throughout  the  interview  he  was  sobbing.    The 
appellant admitted that he was responsible for the fatal injuries. 

The case for the prosecution was straightforward.  The appellant had decided to kill 
his wife before she arrived at the house and that this was why he asked her brother-in-
law to remain outside.  The crown alleged that he had locked the back door of the 
house.  He had placed knives close to hand in preparation for the attack, which started 
almost as soon as she entered the house.  The appellant was jealous and controlling 
and he resented Mrs Parker’s newly found confidence and ambition, and, although not 
habitually violent, he was capable of being violent towards her, as indeed he had been 
on the previous night.  He was guilty of murder. 

The defence case was that the appellant was guilty of manslaughter, but not murder, 
on the basis of “loss of control” within the 2009 Act.  There was no pre-planning and 
that the loss of control resulted from a combination of the contents of the text message 
demanding that he leave the family home, which it was said came as a “bolt from the 
blue”, and from what she said to him and her manner when she returned to the house, 
and his realisation that she would have the children and that she had been planning 
this for a while with other people behind his back. 

The  appellant  was  a  man  of  previous  good  character.    In  evidence  he  described 
various problems in the relationship at an earlier stage, but by 2010 he thought the 
relationship was in good order.  He knew nothing of any relationship in which she had 
become involved.   

The  argument  on  the  evening  of  26th  October  was  about  money.    He  said  that  he 
 
pushed her out of frustration as he walked past.  The cup struck her in the mouth.  He 
 
didn’t realise she had an injury, and didn’t mean to hurt her.  She chucked it at him 
and its contents went everywhere.  He cleared it up.  He apologised.  They had sexual 
intercourse together that night. 

 
On  the  following  morning  she  took  him  to  work  and  then  went  with  the  children. 
They had a disagreement via text messages as to whether he had apologised for the 
incident the previous night, but he still thought that everything was all right between 
them.  She collected him from work because he was unwell, dropped him off home, 
and then went back to the children. 

 
The text message came as a “bolt from the blue”.  He was devastated.  He used the 
small knife which was later found under Mrs Parker’s body to self harm, scratching 
his left forearm repeatedly but not deeply.  He scored a love heart onto his ribs. He 
wrote a non-threatening letter to his wife, professing his love for her. He was really

upset,  distressed  and  crying,  and  not  thinking  clearly.    He  had  never  self  harmed 
before. 

 
93.	 

He  said  that  he  put  that  knife  down  in  the  kitchen  and  went  upstairs  to  pack  his 
 
belongings.  He felt that he had no choice.  He looked through a family photograph 
album which he happened to come across, and became increasingly upset.  He texted 
 
her asking how long she would be.  He wanted to be able to tell her that he loved her. 

 

94.	  When she returned home, the car pulled up without the children.  He realised it was 
all over between them, and that her actions had been pre-planned.  He remembered 
going to the back door, but did not recall opening it or asking her brother-in-law to 
give them a minute, nor did he recall locking the back door, although he accepted that 
he must have done.  Mrs Parker walked passed him into the kitchen.  He followed and 
pleaded with her not to leave.  He said that he loved her.  With a smug look on her 
face she said that she did not love him anymore.  He then lost it. 

 
95.	 

He said that he was upset and he “snapped “and lashed out at her.  He said that he did 
not  recall  doing  it.  He  could  not  recall  if  he  used  the  small  knife.    He  had  no 
recollection of the large knife or of the attack itself.  The next thing he could recall 
was his brother-in-law with his arm around his neck shouting at him to drop the knife. 

 

96.	  We must briefly address a distinct further submission on appeal.  During the course of 
 
the Crown’s case, the prosecution sought leave to introduce hearsay evidence from 
friends and family about the background to the relationship and events which led up 
to Mrs Parker’s death.  This included evidence of  violence by the appellant directed 
at his wife.  The crown suggested that this was admissible hearsay and admissible as 
bad  character  evidence  under  section  101(1)(c)  as  important  explanatory  evidence 
 
within the ambit of section 102 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003.   

Although  it  was  accepted  at  trial  that  a  number  of  different  categories  of  evidence 
could be put before the jury by consent, the main contention was that the evidence of 
previous incidents of violence should be excluded.  The level of violence described by 
the  witnesses  did  not  provide  any  real  explanation  for  the  level  of  violence  which 
occurred on the afternoon of Mrs Parker’s death.  There was a dispute about some of 
the details, and this would lead to satellite litigation. 

The judge ruled that evidence of the appellant’s bad behaviour to his wife, including 
the occasional use of violence, was relevant to the prosecution case not least because 
it  made  it  more  likely  that  the  crown’s  submission  as  to  the  truth  of  events  which 
occurred on 27th October was correct.  It was relevant, and unless there were reasons 
 
for  it  to  be  excluded,  it  should  be  admitted.    Although  hearsay,  it  was  admissible 
pursuant to section 116 of the 2003 Act, and the judge was satisfied that it was in the 
 
interests of justice that the evidence should be put before the jury.  In relation to the 
admissibility of bad character evidence he held that in principle it was admissible.  To 
exclude it would deprive the jury of important explanatory evidence and leave them 
 
with only the appellant’s version of the background.  This would convey an unreal 
 
impression of the facts, and make it difficult for the jury to grasp the issues in the 
case.  Although he specifically excluded passages of the evidence from two witnesses, 
in general terms he agreed with the crown’s submissions.

R – v - Clinton, Parker & Evans 

 

 
99.	 

This ground of appeal arises from a straightforward ruling which, when examined in 
the factual background, causes us no concern.  It is further suggested that the judge 
gave inadequate directions to the jury about how this evidence should be approached. 
We are equally untroubled. 

 

 

100.	  The main ground of appeal arises from the way in which the judge directed the jury 
on the loss of control issue.  It is suggested that he failed to direct them adequately 
about the burden of proof, wrongly implying that the burden rested on the defendant. 
Alternatively, the summing up on these issues was unclear and confusing and had the 
effect of reversing the burden of proof. 

 

 
101.	 

 
102.	 

The criticisms of the judge’s directions to the jury  begin with his assertive failure to 
 
tell  them  what  a  “loss  of  control”  was,  and  what  it  amounted  to,  and  the  jury’s 
 
attention was not drawn to all relevant matters in a coherent way. 

Judge Mettyear began his directions to the jury in unequivocal terms.  The burden of 
proof  rested  on  the  prosecution.  It  “always,  always  rests”  on  the  prosecution  and 
never shifts.  The Crown had to prove all the elements of the offence.  The standard to 
be reached was that the jury had to be sure of guilt.  The directions were given in 
 
unequivocal terms. 

 
103.	 

In his route to verdict (which was agreed by both counsel at trial), the judge directed 
the jury: 

“The defendant has admitted unlawful killing of his wife Jane 
Parker.  He is, on the facts of this case guilty of murder unless 
the killing resulted from his loss of self control”. 

Question 1. When he stabbed Jane had he lost self control? 

If you are sure he had not lost his self control your verdict must be guilty of murder 
 
and you should proceed no further.  Otherwise go to the next question. 

Question 2. Was the defendant’s loss of self control caused by a qualifying trigger? 
 
(note.  The qualifying triggers are things which you find to be said or done by Jane 
 
individually or in combination which 

a.	  constitute circumstances of an extremely grave character and  

 

 

b.	  which caused the defendant to have a justified sense of being seriously wronged. 
 
You should look at the whole of the evidence relating to the relationship between 
them including the events of the 27th October, when judging whether things said 
or  done  by  Jane  constituted  circumstances  which  caused  the  defendant  to  have 
justifiable sense of being seriously wronged. 

If you are sure that his loss of self control was not caused by a qualifying trigger or 
  
triggers then your verdict must be guilty of murder and you should proceed no further. 
Otherwise go on to the next question. 

Question 3.  Might a man of the defendant’s age with a normal degree of tolerance 
and  self  restraint  have  reacted  in  the  same  or  in  a  similar  way  to  the  way  that  the 
 
defendant reacted?
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R – v - Clinton, Parker & Evans 

 

 
If you are sure that such a person would not have reacted in the same or similar way 
to  the  defendant  then  your  verdict  must  be  guilty  of  murder.    If  you  think  such  a 
person  might  have  reacted  in  the  same  or  a  similar  way  your  verdict  must  be  not 
 
guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter.   

 

104.	  We have examined the document, and the judge’s oral directions.  On this particular 
point,  taken  in  isolation,  the  answer  to  the  second  question  could  have  been  more 
 
felicitously expressed in relation to the burden of proof.  However that may be, the 
remainder of the directions to the jury were impeccable.  In particular, the references 
in  the  route  to  verdict  plainly  put  the  burden  of  proof  where  it  rested.   It  carefully 
isolated the three ingredients of the “loss of control” defence.   We have examined the 
 
criticisms  of  the  summing  up  with  care.    We  can  discern  no  unfairness  or  lack  of 
balance.  It fairly reflected the available evidence.  The defence was put before the 
jury  in  careful  detail.  We  cannot  identify  any  reason  for  concluding  that  this 
conviction was unsafe. 

 

 

105.	  Before leaving the conviction appeal we propose to add one further observation.  The 
judge was not invited to withdraw the “loss of control” defence from the jury.  With 
our increased understanding of the differences between the loss of control defence and 
the former provocation defence, we anticipate that such a submission would now be 
 
raised by the Crown for the judge to consider.  He might well have concluded that the 
 
matters  relied  on  by  the  appellant  could  not  reasonably  be  treated  by  any  jury  as 
circumstances of an extremely grave character which caused him to have a justifiable 
sense that he had been seriously wronged. 

 

106.	  The appeal against conviction is dismissed.  We were invited to give leave to appeal 
against  sentence.    The  submission  that  the  sentence  was  manifestly  excessive  is 
unarguable.  The  judge  carefully  weighed  the  essential  features  of  the  case  and, 
bearing in mind the provisions of Schedule 21, reached a conclusion which cannot be 
criticised. 

R v Dewi Evans 
 

 

107.	  The  applicant  was  a  man  of  good  character,  aged  61  years  at  trial.    He  had  been 

married to his wife …, … for 41 years.  They had adult children, and grandchildren.  

108.	  On 11th November 2010 the appellant inflicted stab wounds to his wife’s neck and 

 

killed her. 

 

109.	  The prosecution case was that she was murdered because she told her husband that 
 
she was going to leave him.  The defence case was that Mrs Evans had stabbed the 
 
appellant before he stabbed her, and when he did stab her he had lost his self control. 
The crown’s case was that wounds found on the appellant after the fatal attack were 
self  inflicted,  but    that  in  any  event,  when  stabbing  his  wife,  he  had  acted  out  of 
revenge and not through any loss of control. 

 

110.	  The question raised in this appeal is whether the judge properly directed the jury as to 
the  meaning  of  the  words  in  section  54(4)  of  the  2009  Act,  “acted  in a  considered 
desire for revenge”.

R – v - Clinton, Parker & Evans 

 

 

111.	  For the children of this couple, this trial must have been an ordeal.  Their son gave 
evidence about his father’s gentleness.  He never lost his temper or raised his voice.  It 
was his mother who told them off.  He accepted that his mother had a bit of a temper. 
He had never seen her act violently towards him, although she had told him that on 
one occasion she had slapped his father.  He thought that when he was growing up his 
parents  had  a  brilliant  relationship.    Their  daughter  also  described  a  happy  loving 
relationship, at any rate until an incident in 2004, when the appellant found the dead 
body  of  his  neighbour.  Thereafter  he  became  totally  different,  very  lazy  and 
unmotivated, and much quieter, reliant for everything on his wife.  She tried to help 
him, but gradually she became frustrated at his behaviour.  He became obsessed with 
 
her,  like  a  shadow.  He  was  referred  to  a  counsellor  and  psychiatrist.    Mrs  Evans 
started to become aggressive, shouting at him, because he was lazy and pathetic.  She 
saw her mother push her father on a number of occasions, and her mother told her that 
she had slapped the appellant more than once.  

 

 

112.	  Plainly, after 2004 the marriage sadly deteriorated.  Mrs Evans talked about leaving 
the  appellant,  but  when  in  the  end  she  could  not  do  it.  She  had  applied  to  be  re-
housed in March 2007.  She was offered a flat.  Then she turned it down, saying that 
she did not want to move.  She wanted to remain on the housing list.  In April 2009 
she stated on a housing application form that her husband suffered from depression. 
 
He needed his own room. 

 

113.	  Evidence from an occupational therapist described how the appellant acknowledged 
that his problems related to and arose from the death of his neighbour.  His wife was 
 
very supportive.  She wanted him to change so that they could go back to the life they 
used to have together.  He also said that he was concerned that his wife was having an 
affair.  He was diagnosed as suffering from depression and severe anxiety.  He was 
seen by psychiatric nurses for assessment and treatment of his mental health on some 
 
eighteen occasions between December 2008 and July 2010. 

 

114.	  On 11th November 2010 their son could hear his parents arguing in the early morning. 
His  mother  was  in  the  kitchen  sobbing,  saying  she  could  not  take  any  more.    Mrs 
Evans  called  her  daughter  who  described  her  as  upset.    Various  members  of  the 
family saw Mrs Evans that day, and by then she seemed like her normal self.  Their 
son saw them both at 13.30, and their daughter saw her mother at 14.45.  Both were 
untroubled.  He  said  that  his  parents  were  happy,  and  their  daughter  said  that  her 
mother was fine. 

 

 

115.	  At about 16.45 the son arrived home with his children.  He walked into the house and 
saw his mother on the floor.  Her face was swollen.  There was a knife on the floor 
next to her.  He went into the bedroom and found the appellant.  He said “I couldn’t 
 
help myself” or “I couldn’t control myself I lost my temper”.  The appellant lifted his 
tee-shirt and showed his son a wound on the stomach.  Help arrived.  The appellant 
 
was seen in the bedroom.  He said that he had been stabbed.  When the police arrived 
the appellant was lying on the bed clutching his stomach.  The record of what he said 
was “Had an argument.  She went for a knife.  I went berserk so I stabbed her in the 
neck.  I cut my wrist.  My wife stabbed me in the stomach.  She stabbed me in the 
bedroom.  I grabbed knife and stabbed her in living room, twice to neck”. 

116.  When  the  paramedics  arrived  the  appellant  said  that  he  had  caused  injuries  to  his 

 

wrist, and his wife had caused the wound to his abdomen.

R – v - Clinton, Parker & Evans 

 

 

 
117.	  The knife found on the living room floor had been a lock knife purchased by the son 
many years earlier.  Mrs Evans didn’t like it, and their son believed that it had been 
handed in during a knife amnesty.  He had never seen it in a drawer or cupboard in the 
kitchen.  It had never been left in a unit.  It might have been kept in the tool box in the 
shed.  The knife found on the bed, referred to as the green handled kitchen knife, was 
kept in a utensil jar in the kitchen, for show. 

 

118.	  On  post  mortem  four  separate  penetrating  incise  wounds,  seven  superficial  incise 
wounds, wounds, caused by a separate impact, but with two separate injuries possibly 
caused in one action were found.  There was bruising to the lips, swollen eyelids, and 
defensive  injuries,  together  with  an  abrasion  on  the  neck.    There  was  evidence  to 
suggest  that  pressure  had  been  applied  to  the  neck.    The  account  given  by  the 
appellant in interview did not account for the totality of the injuries sustained by his 
wife.  Either knife could have caused the superficial incised wounds.  The lock knife 
was the more likely cause of the penetrating wounds.  The deep penetrating wounds to 
 
the neck caused death. 

 

119.	  Neither the pathologist nor the forensic scientist could throw significant light on the 
question  whether  the  appellant  had  suffered  an  injury  to  his  stomach  before  he 
stabbed  his  wife.  Analysis  of  blood  stains  and  findings  of  blood,  again,  were 
 
inconclusive. 

120.	  The appellant was interviewed on a number of occasions.  As he did not give evidence 

 

at trial, we should set out his account in some detail. 

 

121.	  During the first interview, the appellant said that they were watching television and 
started to argue.  His wife started shouting at him over something silly.  He said he 
would  watch  television  in  the  bedroom.    Five  minutes  or  so  later  she  came  to  the 
bedroom holding the kitchen knife and held it to the soft part at the bottom of his neck 
saying, “I’ll let you have this in your throat now”.  He responded “You do that”.  She 
had  done  this  before,  he  thought  it  was  a  joke.    She  then  called  him  an  ugly  little 
 
bastard, taking a step back and with both hands on the knife, she stabbed him in the 
stomach, leaving the knife in place.  She left the bedroom, and he pulled the knife out 
and threw it down on the bed.  The wound wasn’t bleeding.  He could not remember 
 
whether  his  tee-shirt  was  up  or  down  when  she  stabbed  him,  a  question  of  some 
 
importance because no cuts to the tee-shirt were found.  He said “I was mad, crazy, I 
 
saw stars”. 

 

122.	  He went into the kitchen to look at his wound in better light.  The wound was still not 
 
bleeding.  The lock knife was on the top of the unit.  He then noticed some yellow 
liquid coming out of the wound.  This made him feel mad.  He opened up the knife 
and stabbed his wife in the throat.  He said “it wasn’t a spur of the moment thing, it 
just … look at the knife, went in the living room and stuck it in her throat”.  He said 
he knew what he had done, but at the time it was just the way he felt. 

 

123.	  Later he said “I wasn’t intending to, you know, to do that, it’s just that it happened on 
the  spur  of  the  moment  thing”.    He  hadn’t  walked  in  intending  to  do  it.    He  had 
walked into the lounge and things happened from there.  He decided to do what he did 
when he was walking into the lounge.  He intended to frighten her, but everything got 
out of hand.  He agreed that he had stabbed his wife twice in the throat.  As he walked 
out he started to bleed heavily from his wound.  When he saw the injuries to his wife

he said to himself “well what have I done?  I thought the best way, the easiest way out 
was to go back to the bedroom, pick up the other knife and slit my wrists”.  There 
were two stab wounds because he thought he had missed with the first. 

 

 
In the second interview he said that no violence took place in the living room other 
than his wife grabbing his arm.  He did not think that he had stabbed her a third time. 
 
He dropped the knife down by the settee and put his hand on it.  When he walked into 
the lounge his wife had said something like “go on then good boy”.  When he stabbed 
her he had his hand on her shoulder for balance.  The struggle only lasted for seconds, 
and when he stabbed her the first and second time he thought “what am I doing?”  He 
 
intended  to  hurt  her,  but  he  went  too  far.    After  stabbing  his  wife  he  stood  in  the 
passage for a while and went back to the bedroom and cut his wrist. 

In this interview he said that he had felt frightened of his wife when she held the knife 
 
over  him.    She  had  held  the  knife  to  his  throat  before.    He  went  on  to  state  that 
relations that day had been pretty good.  She had kicked him in the morning.  He said 
that if she fancied giving him a clout, she would.  His son had seen her do it.  She had 
pulled his hair, hit his head against a wall and kicked him.  This had happened on 
several occasions.  She would hit him once a day.  This had gone on for a few years. 
 
Asked  why  she  treated  him  in  this  way,  he  said  that  he  nagged  her,  he  didn’t  do 
anything physically, but perhaps mentally.   

In the third interview he said that if he wanted to injure his wife he would have taken 
the knife which she had used to stab him.  It was when he was in the kitchen that he 
 
started boiling.  He just wanted to stab her back after he had seen the knife.  He felt 
ashamed to call the police and say he had been stabbed by his wife.  He didn’t know 
how  his  wife  had  received  injuries  to  her  face  and  neck,  because  he  had  never 
punched her. 

  

 

In  the  fourth  interview  he  said  that  he  was  concerned  that  his  wife  was  having  an 
affair.  That morning she had told him that she was going to leave him, but that was 
 
something she said every other day.  He denied that it was the thought of her leaving 
that drove him to assault her.  It was put to him that the stab wound to his stomach 
was higher than his belly button, but below his ribs, and his shirt would have had to 
come  up  very  high  to  have  been  missed  by  the  knife.    He  insisted  that  he  had  not 
stabbed himself.  He thought he had only stabbed his wife twice.  He denied making 
the other two penetrating puncture wounds. 

 

128.	  When  he  summed  up  the  judge  addressed  the  issue  of  loss  of  self  control  in 
accordance  with  section  54  and  55  of  the  2009  Act.    He  explained  a  loss  of  self 
 
control. 

“The  defendant  lost  his  self  control  if  his  ability  to  restrain 
himself  was  so  overwhelmed  by  emotional  passion  that  he 
could not resist the impulse to attack (his wife) with a knife.  A 
considered  act  of  revenge,  whether  performed  calmly  or  in 
anger, is not a loss of self control.  The Act of Parliament says 
that  the  defence  does  not  apply  if  the  defendant  acted  in  a 
considered desire of revenge.”
--------
Judgment Approved by the court for handing down.	 
 
 

R – v - Clinton, Parker & Evans 

 

That  was  precisely  accurate,  a  clear  reference  to  the  crown’s  contention  that  Mrs 
Evans had been killed in the course of a revenge attack on her by her husband. 

129.	  The judge then amplified the meaning of a considered desire for revenge: 

 

“An act of retribution as a result of a deliberate and considered 
decision to get your own back, that is one that has been thought 
about.  If you are sure that what the defendant did was to reflect 
on what had happened and the circumstances in which he found 
himself  and  decided  to  take  his  revenge  on  (his  wife),  that 
would not have been a loss of self control as the law requires.” 

 

130.	  He  then  summarised  the  evidence  relied  on  by  the  crown  which  was  said  to  be 
consistent with an absence of loss of control but consistent with a considered act of 
revenge.  He  then,  with  equal  emphasis,  summarised  the  evidence  relied  on  by  the 
defence to show that there must or may have been a loss of self control, and that he 
 
was not acting out of a considered desire for revenge.  He concluded this part of his 
 
summing up: 

“If  you  conclude  so  that  you  are  sure  either  that  this  was  a 
considered act of revenge by the defendant or that he had not 
lost the ability to control himself, this defence does not apply 
and your verdict would be guilty of murder”. 

 

131.	  The  criticism  of  this  direction  is  that  it  did  not  provide  the  jury  with  a  sufficient 
elucidation  of  the  significance  of  the  use  of  the  word  “considered”  in  its  statutory 
 
context.  The problem with the argument is simple.  The judge directed the jury in 
accordance with the statutory language.  There was no need to rewrite, and there was 
a  potential  for  confusion  if  he  had  rewritten  the  language  of  the  statute,  and 
reformulated the statutory criteria.  There was no reason to do so.  The language is 
clear.  The direction accurately encapsulated the issue to be decided by the jury, and

SUMMARY TO ASSIST THE MEDIA
 
 

 

 

 

 

 
The Court examines each of these in turn: 
  

 

  

  
 
The Court of Appeal (Lord Chief Justice, Mr Justice Henriques and Mrs Justice Gloster) has today 
provided its first interpretation of the legislation that generated the new partial defence to murder, 
 
'loss of control'. 
  
The Court gave its interpretation of sections 54 and 55 of the Coroners and Justice Act (CJA) 2009 whilst 
 
considering the appeals of three men against their convictions for murder. 
  
 
Section 54 (1) contains three statutory components to the 'loss of control' defence: 
  

 

 

(1)  Where a person (“D”) kills or is party to the killing of another (“V”), D is not to be convicted 

 
of murder if – 
(a) D’s acts and omissions in doing or being a party to the killing resulted from D’s loss of 
 
self-control, 
 
(b) the loss of self-control had a qualifying trigger, and 
(c) a person of D’s sex and age, with a normal degree of tolerance and self-restraint and in 
the circumstances of D, might have reacted in the same or in a similar way to D. 

 
(a) Loss of self- control (para 10) 
 
(b) Qualifying trigger (paras 11 - 29) 
 
(c) Would a similar person in the same circumstances have reacted the same way? (paras 34 - 32) 

 

Section 55 of the CJA 2009 sets out the qualifying triggers for the defence and explicitly states that sexual 
 
infidelity must be disregarded. 
  
 
The Court considers the full extent of the prohibition against 'sexual infidelity' as a qualifying trigger for the 
 
purposes of the loss of control defence. (paras 34 – 44) 
  
 
Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice, giving the Court's judgment said: 
  
""... The question is whether or not sexual infidelity is wholly excluded from consideration in the 
context of features of the individual case which constitute a permissible qualifying trigger or triggers 
 
within section 55(3) and (4). 
  
""We have examined the legislative structure as a whole.  The legislation was designed to prohibit the 
 
misuse of sexual infidelity as a potential trigger for loss of control in circumstances in which it was 
thought to have been misused in the former defence of provocation.  Where there is no other 
potential trigger, the prohibition must, notwithstanding the difficulties identified earlier in the 
 
judgment, be applied. 
  
""…. In section 54(1)(c) and (3) the legislation further acknowledges the impact of sexual infidelity as 
a potential ingredient of the third component of the defence, when all the defendant’s circumstances 
fall for consideration, and when, although express provision is made for the exclusion of some 
features of the defendant’s situation, the fact that he/she has been sexually betrayed is not.  In short, 
sexual infidelity is not subject to a blanket exclusion when the loss of control defence is under
--------
consideration.  Evidence of these matters may be deployed by the defendant and therefore the 
legislation proceeds on the basis that sexual infidelity is a permissible feature of the loss of control 
 
 
defence. 
  
 
""The ambit of section 55(3) and (4) – the second component, the qualifying triggers – is clearly 
 
defined.  Any qualifying trigger is subject to clear statutory criteria.  Dealing with it broadly, to qualify 
as a trigger for the defendant’s loss of control, the circumstances must be extremely grave and the 
 
defendant must be subject to a justifiable sense of having been seriously wronged.  These are fact 
specific questions requiring careful assessment, not least to ensure that the loss of control defence 
does not have the effect of minimising the seriousness of the infliction of fatal injury.  Objective 
evaluation is required and a judgment must be made about the gravity of the circumstances and the 
 
extent to which the defendant was seriously wronged, and whether he had a justifiable sense that he 
 
had been seriously wronged. 
  
""Our approach has, as the judgment shows, been influenced by the simple reality that in relation to 
the day to day working of the criminal justice system events cannot be isolated from their context.  
We have provided a number of examples in the judgment.  Perhaps expressed most simply, the man 
who admits, “I killed him accidentally”, is never to be treated as if he had said “I killed him”.  That 
would be absurd.  It may not be unduly burdensome to compartmentalise sexual infidelity where it is 
the only element relied on in support of a qualifying trigger, and, having compartmentalised it in this 
way, to disregard it.  Whether this is so or not, the legislation imposes that exclusionary obligation 
on the court.  However, to seek to compartmentalise sexual infidelity and exclude it when it is 
integral to the facts as a whole is not only much more difficult, but is unrealistic and carries with it 
 
the potential for injustice.  In the examples we have given earlier in this judgment, we do not see how 
any sensible evaluation of the gravity of the circumstances or their impact on the defendant could be 
made if the jury, having, in accordance with the legislation, heard the evidence, were then to be 
 
directed to excise from their evaluation of the qualifying trigger the matters said to constitute sexual 
infidelity, and to put them into distinct compartments to be disregarded.  In our judgment, where 
sexual infidelity is integral to and forms an essential part of the context in which to make a just 
evaluation whether a qualifying trigger properly falls within the ambit of subsections 55(3) and (4), 
 
the prohibition in section 55(6)(c) does not operate to exclude it. 
  
""We have proceeded on the assumption that legislation is not enacted with the intent or purpose that 
 
the criminal justice system should operate so as to create injustice.  We are fortified in this view by 
the fact that, although the material did not assist in the construction of section 55(6)(c), our 
conclusion is consistent not only with the views expressed in Parliament by those who were 
opposed in principle to the enactment of section 55(6)(c) but also with the observations of ministers 
 
who supported this limb of the legislation."" (paras 34 - 40)

INNER LONDON CROWN COURT 


 

 
R –V- DARRELL DESUZE 

 
 

 
SENTENCING REMARKS 

 

17 APRIL 2012 

 

 

 

 

I have to sentence this Defendant for three offences: Manslaughter, violent disorder and 
burglary. 
 
 They were committed on 8th August 2011 in the course of the civil disorder that affected 
many parts of the country. It was the third day of the disorder. Anyone who travelled to parts 
 
of London knowing that rioting was going to take place was well aware of the level of violence 
likely to be involved and the amount of loss, harm and distress that the riots had already 
caused.  
 
 The Defendant went with others to Ealing having heard that rioting was to take place. His 
 
case is that he went to see what was going on. Unlikely as that may be, I will assume it is true 
but if he started as a spectator, he soon became a willing participator.  
 
 The violent disorder which took place in Ealing that night was extremely serious. Large 
  
numbers of people, many of them young men with their faces covered, made their way 
through the centre of Ealing smashing windows; looting shops and attacking outnumbered 
police officers who tried to stop their progress. They hurled missiles at the police, they ripped 
up street furniture and they set fire to rubbish which they emptied from rubbish bins on to 
the street.  
 
 Darrell Desuze played a full part in the violence. He can be seen on the CCTV smashing 
windows, looting shops, throwing missiles at the police and wheeling rubbish bins into the 
street so that they could be set on fire.  
 
Most people who were aware of the violence were no doubt afraid to go out on the streets and 
  
those unwittingly caught up in it must have been terrified by the scenes of lawlessness. 
 
One person who was not terrified to be out and was not prepared to be forced off the streets 
was Richard Mannington Bowes. He can be seen on the CCTV passing in and out of the 
rioters and as he came to the rubbish bins which had been set on fire, he bent down. It is
--------
clear and is accepted that he bent down to remove a burning item from a rubbish bin and 
prevent the spread of fire. As he straightened up the Defendant punched him on the jaw. The 
blow can be seen on the CCTV coverage. It was a hard blow and it was aimed at Mr Bowes’ 
jaw to prevent him doing what he was doing. It succeeded; at the least, the blow stunned him 
 
so that he went straight down to the ground without breaking his fall, hitting his head on the 
hard surface of the road. He sustained serious head injuries. 
He died as a result of those injuries.  Whether the blow was struck because Mr Bowes was 
trying to prevent the fire spreading or because the Defendant believed that a piece of burning 
paper removed from the fire had fallen in his direction does not seem to me to matter.  
 
 
The death of Mr Bowes was pointless and unnecessary and it became for the public one of 
the most, if not the most, shocking event of the riots in London.  
 
The offence of manslaughter is always serious but this case is the more serious because it was 
committed within the context of widespread civil disorder.  
 
There is little mitigation arising out of the facts. The Defendant has admitted manslaughter 
not murder and I sentence the Defendant on the basis that he neither intended to kill Mr. 
Bowes or to cause him really serious bodily harm. There was only one punch but it was a 
 
forceful one which not only did, but was likely to render the victim senseless for a period of 
time. I do not consider it helpful to have a special category of cases called ‘one punch 
manslaughters’. The fact that there was only one blow is one factor among many that the 
Court will take into account when considering sentence. The Defendant did assist in moving 
 
Mr. Bowes unconscious body on to the pavement. While I do regard that as mitigation it does 
mean that he was well aware at the time that he had caused serious injury to Mr. Bowes.  
Indeed he returned again and saw that Mr. Bowes was still not moving. I do consider that it 
is a significant  aggravating factor that, having rendered his victim unconscious and realising 
that he had done him serious harm, he then went on to continue to take  part in the 
disturbances by looting four shops.  
 
There are a number of factors personal to Darrell Desuze which affect the sentence that I 
pass. He is still only 17 and was 16 at the time he committed these offences. I have therefore 
had to consider and apply the advice relevant to sentencing young offenders. In particular I 
have borne in mind the principal aim of the Youth Justice system which is to prevent the 
commission of offences by young persons and I also have to have at the forefront of my 
  
considerations the welfare of the Defendant. 
 
Darrell Desuze has never been convicted of any offence before this and is entitled to credit to 
 
reflect his good character. He pleaded guilty to the offences of burglary at the PCMH and he 
pleaded guilty to the offences of violent disorder and manslaughter on the date of trial. He is 
therefore entitled to full credit for his pleas to the burglaries but only limited credit for the 
late pleas to the other offences. I have had to consider whether in the light of the offences 
that he has admitted he is a dangerous offender. I have considered the nature of the offences 
and the factors identified in the pre-sentence report and in the end I have concluded that, 
because of his age and his previous good character, this is not a case where I should pass an 
indeterminate sentence. 
 
 
I am  satisfied that the only sentence that I can possibly pass to reflect the seriousness of  the 
manslaughter offence is Detention under s.91 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) 
Act 2000. That sentence is not available on the charges of burglary or violent disorder and 
the Court of Appeal have said that in those circumstances the appropriate course is to pass a 
 
sentence on the manslaughter which reflects all the offences and pass no separate sentence 
on the others. That makes a difference in this case as I would have passed consecutive 
sentence for the burglaries, principally because  they were committed after the Defendant
--------
must have known that he had seriously injured Mr Bowes. Accordingly I have increased the 
sentence that I would otherwise have passed for the manslaughter. 
 
Sentences passed by the Courts in the immediate aftermath of the riots were severe and the 
Court of Appeal approved the level of those sentences. Those sentences were passed on 
people who admitted immediately what they had done and pleaded guilty at the first 
opportunity. It is important that the Courts sentencing people, who did not make early 
admissions, use the same sentencing starting points even though the initial wave of public 
condemnation for their behaviour may have passed.  
 
Taking into account all those matters the least sentence that I can impose for these serious 
offences is 8 years detention under S. 91 of the Powers of the Criminal Courts Act 
 
(Sentencing) Act 2000. I impose it for the offence of manslaughter but it should be 
understood that it is intended to reflect all the offending of the Defendant on this night. 
Accordingly, I pass no separate penalty for the other offences. Had it not been for the pleas of 
guilty the sentence would have been about 10 years.",2012-04-17 00:00:00,UK Crown Court

HIS HONOUR JUDGE CHRISTOPHER MOSS QC
 

THE QUEEN -V- VICTORIA OSOTEKU
 
 

   
SENTENCING REMARKS
 

 

 
On the 25th  March 2010 at about 5.15 pm, during the evening rush hour, in the presence and 

 

sight  of  many  horrified  commuters,  Sofyen  Belamoudden,  a  fifteen  year  old  boy,  was 

attacked  in  the  ticket  hall  of  the  District  and  Circle  Line  at  Victoria  Station  by  a  pack  of 

 
teenagers.  The  attack  lasted  some  12  seconds  and  was  captured  on  CCTV.  He  was  stabbed 

 
with  knives,  battered  with  other  weapons,  kicked  with  shod  feet.  When  those  12  seconds 

were over Sofyen was left fatally wounded – with no less than nine stab wounds to his body - 

as his attackers made their escape.  

 

 
You  have  been  convicted  of  the  manslaughter  of  the  deceased.  Additionally,  you  stand 

convicted on count 1 of the indictment of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm. 

 

The  dreadful  events  of  that  day  had  their  roots  in  an  altercation  on  the  previous  day  at 

Victoria Station in the course of which one of your fellow students at the St Charles Catholic 

6th  Form  College  in  Ladbroke  Grove,  Melvin  Mensah,  received  a  bloody  nose.      That  night  
 

 

there  was  considerable  text  and  facebook  communication  between  some  students  at  your 

 
college and also with members of what I will call the opposing group, referred to as the West 

London  boys.  The  evidence  reveals  that  you  were  in  contact  with  Raheem  Keane,  of  the 

opposing group, on that evening. 

 

It is also clear from the evidence in the trial that the expected violent confrontation was the 

 
talk of the college on the following day. The evidence from Stephanie Omniuni was that you 

 

 

in  particular  were  talking  about  it.  Her  initial  evidence  was  that  you  told  others  in  the 

canteen that the West London boys had said someone was going to die that day. She said you 

said you had heard it on the telephone the night before. In cross examination she said that 

 

1
--------
you  had  told  her  that  in  the  girls’  changing  room.  Whatever  the  accuracy  of  her  evidence 
 

 

(which you strongly disputed at trial), I have no doubt that you travelled to Victoria on that 

afternoon expecting the sort of violent confrontation which in fact took place and prepared to 

play  your  part  in  it.  She  also  gave  evidence  to  the  effect  that  the  following  day  you  were  
 

 

gloating at college over what had occurred. 

 

Your  group  gathered  in  Terminus  Place  outside  the  Grosvenor  Hotel.  When  challenged  by 
 

members  of  the  opposing  group  you  all  joined  the  mass  charge  across  the  bus  lanes  of 
 

Terminus Place. You were amongst the first to follow Samson Odegbune, as he led the charge 
 

armed  with  his  samurai  sword.      You  joined  the  group  of  killers  who  set  upon  Sofyen 
 

Belamoudden  as  he  lay  helpless  and  defenceless  upon  the  floor  of  the  ticket  hall,  having 
 

pursued him down the stairs as he fell, in the sight of those many horrified onlookers who 
 

had been going about their lawful business at the height, as I have said, of the rush hour. You 

were seen to deliver the final kick to the body of Sofyen as you were the last of the group to 

run away from the scene of the attack. You claimed at trial that this was a nudge of the foot to 
 

 

see if he was alright. However, run away you did, not waiting to tend to the fatally wounded 
 

victim. True you returned some minutes later and spoke to a person in authority at the scene. 
 

However, you did not wait to tell anybody what you had witnessed, but again made yourself 
 

 

 

 

scarce, no doubt having realised by then, if not before, that Sofyen was mortally wounded. 
 

 

It was also the prosecution’s case against you that you intentionally purchased or assisted in 
 

the  purchase  of  a  block  of  knives  and/or  distributed  or  assisted  in  the  distribution  of  such 

knives  realising  that  some  harm,  albeit  short  of  grievous  bodily  harm,  might  be  caused  to 
 

another by the use of those knives or any of them. The murder of Sofyen was assisted by one 
 

or more of the knives purchased at Argos in Shepherds Bush on that very lunch time. It was 
 

said by the Crown that you intentionally purchased or assisted in the purchase, or distributed 
 

or  assisted  in  the  distribution  of  such  a  knife  or  knives  realising  at  least  that  some  harm 

might be caused to another by their use.    At trial you strongly denied that you had played 
 

any  part  in  the  purchase  of  the  block  of  knives  from  Argos.  You  claimed  that  you  were  
 

 

present at Argos with Femi Oderinwale for a very short time, that you had gone to Shepherds 
 

Bush to purchase your lunch from McDonald’s, and that that is what you in fact did.  

 

Of course, I do not know whether the jury convicted you of manslaughter on the basis of the 

purchase  of  the  knives  or  on  the  basis  of  your  actions  at  the  scene  of  the  attack  or  both. 
 

However, I am bound to say that I find the Crown’s case so far as the purchase of the knives 
 

is  concerned  compelling  and  for  my  part  I  reject  your  explanation  of  your  actions  in  the 
 

ticket hall, in particular concerning the kick to the person of the deceased. 
 

 

 

2
--------
The killing of Sofyen Belamoudden took place in dreadful circumstances in a public place as 
 

 

 

I  have  already  described.  You  played  your  part  in  his  death  as  set  out  above  and  stand 

convicted of his manslaughter. His death occurred following a conspiracy to which you were 
 

a significant party. 

 

I  take  into  account  the  positive  matters  that  I  have  read  about  you  in  your  pre-sentence 

 

 

report and in the testimonial provided on your behalf and I have considered carefully all that 

has been advanced on your behalf by Mr Boyce. I take into account the impeccable way you 

 

 

conducted yourself while on trial for many months before this court. I take into account your 
 

 

youth at the time of the commission of these offences. Although the oldest of the defendants, 

you were just 18 years old. Despite all those factors you played a pivotal role in the events of 
 

 

 

and leading up to that day and must take a substantial share of the responsibility for them. 

 

In view of what I have heard and read, I do not feel the need to invoke the dangerousness 
 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions  which  would  lead  to  an  indeterminate  sentence  in  your  case.  I  will  accordingly 
 

pass  determinate  sentences  of  detention  in  a  Young  Offender  Institution.    You  will  have 
 

 

credit  for  425  days  spent  in  custody  or  subject  to  curfew.      You  will  serve  half  of  your 
 

sentence before you may be considered for release upon licence. 

 

I see no reason to treat you any differently to those already sentenced for manslaughter and 

conspiracy in this case. On count 2 of this indictment, for manslaughter, you will be detained 
 

in a young offender institution for 12 years. On count 1, you will serve a concurrent sentence 
 

of 8 years in a young offender institution. 

 

I make no order for defence costs; you have not the means to pay them. 

You may go with the dock officer.

1.  	 THE  VICE  PRESIDENT:  These  five  defendants  were  all  sentenced  on  the  same 
 
occasion in the Crown Court at Sheffield for offences of cultivating cannabis.  Their 
cases are entirely separate, but it has been convenient to hear them here one after the 
other in the same court in much the same way as it was obviously convenient in the 
court below.  That is especially so since the judge sentenced them together and offered 
some generalised remarks about the basis on which he approached such cases. 

2. 	 Amongst those generalised remarks, the judge referred (correctly) to the frequency with 
which  such  cases  were  being  encountered  currently  in  Sheffield.    He  referred  to  the 
impact on the neighbourhoods in which they occurred.  He referred to the decision of 
this court in R v Auton [2011] EWCA Crim. 76, [2011] 2 Cr.App.R (S) 75.  Having 
done so, he said this: 

""If  it  is  not  possible  to  continue  passing  immediate  sentences  of 
 
imprisonment  in  Auton  1  type  cases  under  the  [Sentencing  Council] 
guideline, then I would have no hesitation in saying that in those cases to 
follow the guideline would not be in the interests of justice and decline to 
follow it."" 

He was referring to the then recently published Sentencing Council definitive guideline 
on  drug  offences  which  was  published  in  February  2012  and  was  expressed  to  have 
 
effect from 27th February 2012 onwards.   

3.  	 We are obliged to say that the approach encapsulated in the last brief citation of the 

judge's remarks is wrong.   

4. 	

 

There are inevitably bound to be different views from time to time about the general 
level of sentencing.  In some fields, and drugs offending is one of them, there is a level 
of public debate at least about parts of it.  That may or it may not be one of the reasons 
why Parliament elected to create the Sentencing Council as an independent body to take 
an overview of sentencing and to publish guidelines.  At all events Parliament did so. 
 
The  Sentencing  Council  receives  a  very  wide  range  of  information,  statistical  data, 
research  and  opinion,  both  lay  and  professional.    The  collection  of  information 
available to it is far wider than the members of this court, individually or collectively, 
or  individual  sentencers,  can  hope  to  have.  The  Council  also  engages  in  a 
comprehensive  consultation  programme  before  it  publishes  any  guideline,  frequently 
with the publication of one, or sometimes a succession, of drafts for discussion.  That 
process frequently involves - and it did in this case - extensive testing of commonly 
encountered scenarios upon experienced sentencers, namely Crown Court judges and 
district judges. 

5. 	

There is deliberately built in to the guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council a good 
deal of flexibility, as we shall in a moment demonstrate.  The flexibility available to 
 
Crown  Court  judges  is  appreciable.    It  does  not,  however,  extend  to  deliberately 
disregarding the guidelines, not on the grounds that the case has particular facts which 
warrant distinguishing it from the general level, but because the judge happens to take a 
different  view  about  where  the  general  level  ought  to  be.  The  latter  approach  is 

SMITH BERNAL WORDWAVE
--------
demonstrably unlawful.  It would remove all point from the issuing of any guidelines at 
all but such guidelines are required by the Coroners and Justice Act 2009.  It would 
also, for that matter, equally rob of any point guidelines contained in a decision of this 
court. 
Indeed,  such  approach  amounts  to  frank  disobedience  of  the  statute.    That 
provides in section 125(1) of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 that the court:  

"" ... must follow ... any sentencing guidelines which are relevant to the 
offender's case ... unless satisfied that it would be contrary to the interests 
of justice to do so."" 

In the end, that kind of approach, if adopted, would also be contrary to the rule of law 
 
to which all judges are committed.  Very few judges are fortunate enough to go through 
life  without  encountering  rare  occasions  when  they  would  prefer  the  law  to  be 
 
otherwise to that which it is.  The judge's duty is nevertheless to apply it, whether at 
first instance or in this court, just as it is the duty of the citizen to obey the law whether 
he happens to agree with it or not. 

6.  	 This  court's  decision  in  Auton  was  explicitly  delivered  in  anticipation  that  the  more 
general factors affecting drugs sentencing were to be addressed by the statutory body 
responsible, that is to say the Sentencing Council.  The decision in Auton contained this 
 
observation at paragraph 13: 

""We  are  aware  that  the  Sentencing  Council  has  before  it  the  task  of 
framing  guidelines  for  a  wide  range  of  drug  offences.  What  we  say  by 
way of assistance to judges for the present must necessarily be subject to 
any more general guidelines thus prepared.""  

For  that  additional  reason  it  was  simply  not  open  to  the  judge  to  announce  that  he 
preferred  the  earlier  and  limited  analysis  of  the  level  of  sentencing  which  had  been 
given in Auton to the definitive guidelines published by the Sentencing Council.  One 
of the principal purposes of the Sentencing Council and of the guidelines that it creates 
is  to  avoid  the  necessity  for  repeated  reference  back  in  Crown  Courts,  Magistrates' 
Courts  or  here  to  previous  decisions  whether  they  are  single  instances  or,  for  that 
matter, previously delivered guideline judgments.   

7.  	 There  are  in  fact  some,  but  limited,  differences  between  the  levels  of  sentencing 
contemplated at the time of Auton for offence of cultivation of cannabis and the levels 
of sentences contemplated by the definitive guideline.  The sentencer's job is to read the 
guidelines for what they are.  The differences however are not nearly as large as the 
arguments before the judge seem to have contended.   

8. 	 We recognise that the preparation of guidelines which are designed to assist in advance 
the whole range of drugs sentencing, if they are to be put in a reasonably condensed 
form,  is  a  formidable  task  for  those  who  undertake  it.    We  also  recognise  that  the 
 
concentrated form which such guidelines necessarily take requires reading in a manner 
which is different to reading a narrative judgment of this court given upon one or a few 
cases on known factual bases.  The process is unavoidably different.

The format which is adopted by the Sentencing Council in producing its guidelines is to 
present  the  broad  categories  of  offence  frequently  encountered  pictorially  in  boxes. 
 
That is perhaps convenient, especially since it is necessary to condense the presentation 
as much as possible and to avoid discursive narrative on so wide a range of offending. 
 
It  may  be  that  the  pictorial  boxes  which  are  part  of  the  presentation  may  lead  a 
 
superficial reader to think that adjacent boxes are mutually exclusive, one of the other. 
 
They are not.  There is an inevitable overlap between the scenarios which are described 
in adjacent boxes.  In real life offending is found on a sliding scale of gravity with few 
hard lines.  The guidelines set out to describe such sliding scales and graduations.  We 
wholeheartedly endorse the approach of Mr Wyatt, counsel for one of these defendants 
(Brearley), who asked us to find that a particular case was to be located on examination 
somewhere between two of the pictorial boxes.  

In these guidelines, as in almost all such, there is a recognition that the two principal 
factors which affect sentencing for crime can broadly be collected together as, first, the 
 
harm the offence does, and secondly, the culpability of the offender.  Those two root 
 
factors are often linked but not always.  In some other contexts from that which we are 
now  considering,  such  as  for  example  offences  of  impromptu  violence  or  offences 
which are committed carelessly, the two factors may not march together.  In the context 
of offences which involve a considerable degree of deliberation and planning, such as 
will normally be the case for the production of drugs, they generally do march broadly 
together and certainly the one is likely to colour the other.  Quantity, which is a broad 
 
appreciation of harm, may well colour participation, which is a broad appreciation of 
culpability, and vice versa.  What we have just said about sliding scales applies equally 
to both elements, both to culpability and to harm.  In neither case do the boxes have 
hard edges. 

In these drug guidelines the broad indicator of harm in most cases, not all but including 
the cultivation of cannabis, is quantity.  As this court made clear recently in R v Boakye 
 
[2012]  EWCA  Crim  838,  the  quantities  which  appear  in  the  sentencing  guideline 
pictorial  boxes  as  broad  indicators  of  harm  are  neither  fixed  points  nor  are  they 
thresholds.  They are, as the heading to the relevant column says, ""indicative"" quantities 
designed to enable the experienced judge to put the case into the right context on the 
 
sliding scale.  In the particular context of the production of drugs with which we are 
 
today concerned, they are indicators of output or potential output as the preamble to the 
relevant page (18) explicitly says.  In production cases it is the output or the potential 
 
output  which  counts.  The  guidelines  have  to  provide  for  all  manner  of  production 
methods of all manner of drugs.  They are not limited to cannabis, nor to plants.  Nor 
 
can  they  be  revised  from  month  to  month  as  production  techniques  or  cultivation 
practices or the breeding of plants changes.  At the time of R v Auton and at the time of 
the drafting of these guidelines, such evidence as there was suggested that many cases 
seemed to involve an output of about 28 to 40 grams, or an ounce to an ounce and a 
half, to the plant.  A note on page 18 of the guidelines expressly states this assumption. 
 
Where  numbers  of  plants  are  indicated  that  assumption  underlies  the  numbers.    The 
cases dealt with by the Recorder of Sheffield in the present sequence seem to indicate 
that at least in these cases, and perhaps for all we know more generally, productivity 
has increased markedly.  The indicative quantity for the lower of the categories of harm 
is suggested to be around nine plants.  Nine plants at 40 grams would be about a third 

 

SMITH BERNAL WORDWAVE
--------
of a kilo.  The indicative quantity for the next category up is around 28.  Twenty-eight 
plants at 40 grams would be something just over a kilogram.  The judge however in the 
 
present  case  had  one  or  more  statements  from  police  officers  or  forensic  scientists 
 
indicating a yield very substantially greater than that this: sometimes 100 grams for a 
plant, sometimes 200 and sometimes apparently even more.  That kind of yield is a step 
change.  It  demonstrates  that  the  number  of  plants  is,  as  the  note  to  the  guidelines 
 
makes  clear,  to  be  considered  only  as  a  route  to  the  more  fundamental  question  of 
output or potential output. 

12.  	 In  the  present  case,  the  defendant  McGregor  stood  to  obtain  no  less  than  1.47 
kilograms, just under one and a half kilograms, nearly three-and-a-half pounds, from 
only seven plants.  Another defendant, Brearley, stood to obtain about a kilogram and a 
third from a mere six plants.  As is obvious, that puts their cases and ones like them 
squarely  into  category  3  of  harm  and  not  category  4,  irrespective  of  the  number  of 
plants. 

13.  	 The  same  approach  needs  to  be  applied  to  the  assessment  of  culpability  which  is 
particularly a matter for the experience of the judge.  The guidelines say this, if one 
 
takes one's eyes out of the pictorial boxes and troubles to read the whole of them:   

""Culpability demonstrated by offender's role 

One or more of these characteristics may demonstrate the offender's role. 
 
These lists are not exhaustive.""   

We would draw attention to the use of the words ""may"" and ""not exhaustive"".   

14. 	 The characteristics which are designed to assist sentencers in assessing the culpability 
of  the  defendant  are  couched  in  terms  of  role,  no  doubt  because  many  cases  of 
production,  or  for  that  matter  of  supply,  involve  chains  of  defendants  operating  at 
different levels.  It is no doubt as good a generic word as can be thought of to meet all 
the different types of offence which there might be.  It has somehow to contain within it 
both,  on  the  one  hand,  the  case  where  there  are  several  offenders  operating  with 
different  functions  and,  on  the  other,  those  where  there  is  but  a  single  defendant 
working on his own.  The present cases, with one minor modification, are essentially 
cases  of  people  working  on  their  own.  But  their  culpability  still  has  to  be  assessed. 
 
The  guidelines  make  it  clear  that  one  or  more  of  the  listed  characteristics  may  (we 
 
emphasise) demonstrate the category into which the culpability of the defendant falls 
but  it  also  says  explicitly  that  those  listed  characteristics  are  not  exhaustive.    These 
 
pictorial  boxes  are  not  to  be  treated  as  exhaustively  defining  every  possible  form  of 
criminal activity, even if that were ever possible, which it is not.   

15.  	 The  lowest  level  of  culpability  headed,  for  convenience,  ""lesser  role"",  encompasses 
those whose activity is at the bottom of the range of offending which courts encounter 
in the particular field which one is considering.  So it includes, for example, those who 
are exploited or coerced by others or who became involved through naivety.  Where 
there is a chain it encompasses those who are at the bottom of it and have little or no 
influence on those above them.  It would, to take an example at random, be likely one 

SMITH BERNAL WORDWAVE
--------
suspects to include the defendant whose only function was to be the delivery man taking 
from A to B a batch of cutting agent for the producer who is busy bulking up quantities 
 
of heroin for onward sale. 

16.  	 This  lowest  category  may  (our  emphasis  again)  also  include  those  who  if  operating 

entirely alone are acting entirely for their own use.  The box says so: 

""If  own  operation,  solely  for  own  use  (considering  reasonableness  of 
account in all the circumstances).""   

That recognises a critical distinction which is highly material to these cases.  It is the 
distinction  between  those  who  produce  a  drug  which  will  increase  the  general 
availability of the forbidden substance by circulating it and those who do not.   

17. 	 The defendant who has half a dozen plants or so in a grow-bag alongside his tomatoes 
 
outside the back window is no doubt contemplated as engaged in what the guidelines 
would call a domestic operation (see category 4 of the harm).  Assuming he is growing 
only for his own use, he would clearly have what they envisage as the lowest level of 
culpability  within  the  range  of  offences  of  this  kind.    However,  those  who  create  a 
purpose-built room in the loft or the cellar or the garage, or who dedicate a bedroom to 
the  exclusive  purpose  of  cultivating  cannabis,  having  invested  substantially  in 
professional equipment for watering, for lighting  and/or  for  electronically  controlled 
timing of those operations and others, cannot sensibly be described as having a lesser 
role.  Nor can they sensibly be bracketed with people who perform a limited function 
under  direction,  who  were  engaged  through  coercion  or  intimidation  or  who  were 
involved through naivety or exploitation.  People with the kind of determined approach 
to cultivation which we have described and who are prepared to make the investment, 
do  so  because  they  are  contemplating  repeated  cropping  under  professional  or 
 
semi-professional conditions with dedicated apparatus which has been bought for the 
 
purpose,  usually  at  a  cost  of  some  hundreds  of  pounds.    Those  people  can  perfectly 
 
properly be described, and in our view should be described, as having the kind of level 
of culpability which is the next level up from those who are at the lowest level, ie that 
labelled  ""significant  role.""  Also  in  significant  role  will  be  those  who  like  the 
defendants  we  have  just  described  have  the  apparatus  and  the  dedicated  space  for 
cultivation but in whose case there is a real likelihood of additional wider circulation, 
 
in other words supply, whether for money or not.  That latter group is clearly higher up 
in the sliding scale and higher up in the significant category than those who do not. 
 
There is an essential and important distinction between cases where there is likely to be 
circulation or supply and cases where there is not. 

18. 	 We observe that we are conscious that the Council was not, unlike a judge dealing with 
a single or even a number of similar cases, confining itself to the relatively small part 
of  the  tapestry  which  we  are  here  considering.    It  was  not  confining  itself  to  the 
cultivation of cannabis or even to the production of drugs generally.  It was attempting 
 
the much heavier task of giving help in the sentencing of drugs cases across the board. 
 
In particular, a large part of drug sentencing is concerned with those whose offence is 
not cultivation but supply.  There has to be a sensible relationship between the levels 
for small scale supply and the levels for cultivation which will be likely to give rise to 
 

SMITH BERNAL WORDWAVE
--------
19.  	

circulation or small scale supply.  If one looks at the indicated levels in the section of 
the guidelines concerned with supply (pages 10 to 15) and compares them for cannabis 
with those with which we are concerned, one can see that the Council has sought to 
achieve a proper balance between the two. 

In considering the question of the prospect of supply or circulation, we ought to say 
this.  First, all these cases were explicitly dealt with by the judge on the assumed basis 
that there was no prospect of a future circulation.  We in this court must honour that 
approach.  We cannot forbear to say that the quantities involved in at least two of the 
cases  would  have  caused  all  of  us  acute  anxiety  as  to  whether  the  assertion  of  sole 
consumption  could  possibly  be  truthful.    Second,  it  is  important  to  note  that  the 
prospect of future supply does not generally call for the inclusion of additional counts 
 
for possession with intent to supply.  On this, the view of this court remains that which 
it  held  in  R  v  Auton.  The  offence  of  possession  with  intent  to  supply  relates  to  the 
possession of an identifiable quantity of drug which is in being.  It does not relate to the 
possession  of  plants  from  which  drug  may  or  will  in  the  future  be  extracted.    In 
cultivation cases it follows that the prospect of future supply very often simply has to be 
evaluated  by  the  judge  and  cannot  be  the  subject  of  a  jury  verdict.    Third,  we  have 
deliberately used the expression ""the prospect of circulation or supply"" because it is 
that, as it seems to us, which is the important question.  It is not necessarily the same 
(although  it  often  will  be)  as  the  defendant's  intention.    The  reality  is  that  if  the 
cultivation  process  is  going  to  produce  a  substantial  surplus,  beyond  what  the 
defendant will himself consume, of a substance which is worth something in the general 
region of £10 a gram, there will in many cases (although not all) be a real prospect of 
circulation  even  if  he  did  not  set  out  with  that  principally  in  mind.    Moreover, 
circulation  in  this  context  is  not  confined  to  sale.    Particularly  in  the  context  of 
cannabis  the  use  is  often  semi-socialised.  Those  who  use  it  in  social  conditions  are 
committing an offence just as much as those who use it anywhere else.  The reality is 
 
accordingly very likely quite often to be that supplies of surplus cannabis which has 
been grown will take place without the inevitable exchange of money consideration.  It 
may well take place in circumstances which are rather different from the hole in the 
corner exchange of a small plastic bag at the back of a public house. But it still supply 
and it is still expanding, socialising and increasing the circulation of a product which 
Parliament has forbidden.  Accordingly, what has previously been said in this court in 
a  number  of  cases  about  the  perils  of  the  expression  ""social  supply""  remains  as 
relevant now as it ever was. 

20. 	 As the quantity of cannabis or for that matter any other drug produced increases, the 
likelihood of it all being destined for the sole consumption of the defendant reduces.  It 
may be possible for a defendant to consume a kilogram of cannabis all by himself, but it 
would take some time and involve very heavy use.  Some of these defendants asserted 
that they were heavy users.  The heaviest of them suggested that he had been spending 
as much as £200 per week on his habit.  We do not know, and it is not necessary for the 
purposes  of  this  case  for  the  reasons  we  have  given  for  us  to  investigate,  the 
 
truthfulness  of  that,  nor  to  examine  whether  his  past  income  ever  provided  the 
possibility of him spending at that rate.  But even assuming that it was truthful, it would 
 
take  him  about  a  year  to  consume  a  kilogram  of  cannabis.    The  cycle  of  production 
 
under  the  intensive  conditions  which  were  operated  by  all  these  defendants  and  are 

SMITH BERNAL WORDWAVE
--------
frequently  encountered,  produces  either  three  or  four  crops  each  year,  which  means 
that a unit producing a kilogram at a time is going to produce about three times what 
even that kind of allegedly heavy user could possibly consume for himself.   

 

21.  	 We  wish  to  reiterate  that  if  a  judge  is  faced  with  a  defendant  who  asserts  that  an 
improbably  large  quantity  of  cannabis  is  entirely  for  his  own  use,  he  is  entitled  to 
indicate that he is not presently inclined to accept that assertion.  He is entitled to give 
the defendant and his counsel the opportunity to give evidence about it if he wishes.  We 
would  suggest  that  that  should  generally  be  done,  if  the  quantities  involved  raise  a 
question of improbability.  If it is done it does not involve an adjournment to some long 
post-dated future special hearing; it can usually be accomplished, and should usually 
be accomplished, by the hearing of evidence there and then.  That is, as it seems to us, 
perfectly possible in the time available even in a busy Crown Court list.  The defendant 
may then be able to explain both his production cycle and the consumption that he is 
engaged in, consistently with his occupation and family circumstances, or he may not. 
 
If he can, he must be sentenced on the basis that the drug was for himself.  If he cannot, 
he will be sentenced on a different basis further up in the significant role box and he 
will  of  course  moreover  generally  forgo  most  of  the  reduction  for  the  plea  of  guilty 
which  would  otherwise  have  been  accorded  to  him.    What  however  the  judge  is  not 
entitled to do is to say that he accepts the assertion that the drug cultivation was all for 
the defendant's own use and yet sentence on the basis that there is likely to be a supply 
to somebody else.  In the present case the judge came close, if he did not, to falling into 
that error, for he said, whilst accepting in each of these cases that the use was going to 
 
be personal, this: 

""Often even if the original purpose was personal use there is a temptation 
to supply, not least to recover the set-up costs when the plants produce 
 
more than expected."" 

The sentiment behind those remarks is right.  If it had led him to find that there was a 
prospect  of  supply  in  these  cases,  such  a  finding  would  have  been  wholly 
unchallengeable.  What, however, cannot be done is take that reality into account at the 
 
same time as accepting the defendant's assertion that there is no prospect of supply. 

22. 	 Those general observations lead us to the very clear conclusion that the defendant who 
invests  substantial  sums  in  the  creation  of  a  production  line  for  the  cultivation  of 
cannabis,  usually  in  a  separate  room  dedicated  for  the  purpose,  is  properly  to  be 
located  on  the  sliding  scale  of  culpability  at  the  bottom  end  of  the  significant  role 
category.  Those who do the same where there is a prospect of supply are higher up in 
the significant role category and those who do it where it is frankly clear that there will 
be  supply  for  money  are  a  little  further  up  again.    When  the  operation  becomes 
 
commercial, in the ordinary sense, then one is talking about the uppermost category of 
culpability.  That, as it seems to us, is a perfectly workable form of approach and it is 
entirely consistent with the guidelines.  It does not involve any departure from them at 
all.  If (as here in most cases) the quantities are such as to put the case into category 3, 
then for those where there is no prospect of supply it seems to us that the appropriate 
 
level for sentencing will very often be in the general region of six to 12 months after 
trial.  There  may  of  course  be  cases  where  it  is  entirely  proper  for  there  to  be  a 

 

SMITH BERNAL WORDWAVE
--------
non-custodial  penalty  but  the  general  range  seems  to  us  to  be  that  which  we  have 
identified.  That again, we make clear, is achieved by the application of the guidelines 
and not by departure from them. 

23. 	 That having been said, we turn to the present cases.  The defendant Brearley was 45 
years  of  age.  He  had  a  specially  constructed  room  at  the  back  of  his  garage, 
partitioned  off  from  the  rest  of  it.  Whether  it  was  formally  concealed  or  not  is  not 
entirely  clear. 
In  it  he  had  the  usual  collection  of  equipment  for  the  intensive 
cultivation of cannabis.  At the time that he was arrested there were six plants in there, 
but their potential yield was very high and would have been as much as one and a third 
kilograms.  He had spent something like £600 on the equipment, an investment which 
would have meant undoubtedly that it must have been his intention to have repeated 
crops.  There were aggravating factors.  He involved other people.  On the occasion of 
his  arrest  two  of  his  friends  were  there,  apparently  helping  him  crop  the  plants.    In 
addition, he had bypassed the electricity.  The equipment that is used for this kind of 
intensive cultivation uses a lot of electricity.  That means that the person who does it 
either has to sustain a substantial further investment or he has to swindle the electricity 
company.  Brearley chose the latter course and that is a clear aggravating factor which 
affects the sentence.   

24.  	 At  the  age  of  45  he  had  a  number  of  previous  convictions  but  none  was  for  a  like 
offence.  He pleaded guilty at an early opportunity.  He asserted that the product would 
all  be  for  his  own  use  and  that  appears  to  have  been  accepted  notwithstanding  the 
yield.  We here proceed on the same basis, as we must.  He is a below-knee amputee (he 
is missing a foot) as a result of an unfortunate accident some years ago.  He asserted 
that  he  used  the  cannabis  to  assist  the  phantom  pains  which  he  experienced.    We 
 
observe, as did the judge, that there was no medical evidence whatever, not so much for 
the presence of the pains (which may well exist in an amputee) but for any effort on his 
 
part to obtain legitimate prescription medicine for them.   

25.  	 The  judge  passed  a  sentence  of  nine  months'  imprisonment  which  would  suggest  a 
starting point around 13 months or thereabouts.  Because there is the clear possibility 
that  the  judge's  approach  was  to  some  extent  flawed  by  his  general  approach  to  the 
guidelines, we have thought it right to approach this case, as indeed the others, afresh. 
 
That will result in a modification of the sentence which had there not been the arguably 
flawed approach might have been smaller than would ordinarily justify intervention by 
 
this court.  The proper sentence in his case, given the quantities and the aggravating 
features of the operation, would have been about 12 months after trial, eight months on 
a plea of guilty.  That is based on significant role, category 3.  We allow the appeal and 
substitute the sentence of eight months for nine months. 

26. 	 The defendant McGregor was 24 years of age.  He had constructed a dedicated room 
with a similar set of equipment, no doubt at similar expense, in this case in the loft of 
the house which belonged to his mother where he also lived.  She, it seems, was kept in 
the dark about it.  He had seven plants there at the time of his arrest.  They would have 
yielded as much as 1.47 kilograms of product - in other words something that would be 
worth, were it to be sold, something just short of £15,000.  The offence was aggravated 
by the risk to which he exposed his mother and for that matter by the presence of other 
 

SMITH BERNAL WORDWAVE
--------
non-users in the house who at least were at risk of being affected by the fumes.  He 
 
pleaded guilty.  There had been a warning for a different offence in the past, but he was 
otherwise unconvicted. 

27. 	 Once again, given the quantities and the circumstances of the offence, in our view the 
proper sentence after trial would have been about 12 months.  He pleaded promptly 
and his sentence ought to be eight months in the same way as Brearley's should.  That 
too is based on significant role, category 3.  We allow the appeal, quash the sentence of 
10 months and substitute one of eight. 

28. 	 The defendant Healey had a purpose-built structure of wood erected in the cellar of the 
house where he lived.  It had once again the same kind of specialist semi-professional 
equipment for the cultivation of cannabis.  In his case, as in all the others, clearly a 
continuous process of cultivation was afoot.  There were at the time of his arrest nine 
growing plants with a further 14 cuttings which were clearly going to be the next batch.  
The potential output of those altogether, even taken at the lower assumed yield of 40 
 
grams per plant, would have been something over 900 grams, in other words just short 
of a kilogram. 

29. 	 Healey pleaded guilty at an early stage.  There were cautions as a child, although they 
were for the possession of cannabis, but there were no other convictions and he was 23 
years of age.  The case did not have the aggravating features which were present in the 
case of Brearley and McGregor.  It seems to us the right sentence after trial would have 
been about nine months and accordingly six months to recognise his prompt plea.  That 
also is significant role, category 3.  We allow the appeal.  We quash the sentence of 
 
nine months and substitute one of six months. 

30.  	 The defendant Taylor had a purpose-built room this time in the loft.  The equipment 
once again demonstrated that what was afoot was a continuous process of cultivation. 
There were at the time of arrest eight plants with an estimated yield of 800 grams or 
about £8,000 worth.  He had two previous cautions for the possession of cannabis and 
a number of other unrelated convictions.  He was not a man of good character.  There 
 
were however no particular aggravating features of the kind that we have identified in 
the  case  of  Brearley  and  McGregor.  He  was  28  years  of  age.    In  his  case,  as  in 
Healey's, we think that the sentence after trial ought to have been about nine months 
 
based on significant role, category 3.  We quash the conviction and substitute, allowing 
for his plea of guilty, a sentence of six months. 

 

31. 	 Lastly, the defendant Bolton had a loft conversion structure.  In it at the time he had 10 
plants.  In his case the assumed yield was significantly less.  It was assumed on the 
basis  of  40  grams  of  plant  and  thus  was  only  about  400  grams.    The  defendant 
 
advanced  a  clearly  unsustainable  and  untruthful  story  when  first  asked  about  it  and 
suggested that somebody else had put the equipment and the plants in his loft without 
his knowledge and thereafter there was a good deal of prevarication about his account. 
Eventually, he came before the court on the admitted basis that there would have been 
an  element  of  supply  by  way  of  sale  in  his  offending.    There  are  therefore  two 
differences between his case and the others.  The first is the admitted prospect of sale 
which puts him clearly into the significant role box, but the second is the much smaller 
 

 

SMITH BERNAL WORDWAVE
--------
quantity  which  does  put  him  in  the  lower  category  4  level  of  the  range  of  harm 
contemplated  by  the  guideline. 
In  that  case  the  appropriate  range  is  between  a 
community order and about six months' imprisonment.  He is at the top of that range, 
as it seems to us, and after trial his sentence ought to have been about six months.  His 
plea  was  extremely  late.  We  shall  adjust  it  to  a  small  extent.   We  shall  quash  the 
sentence of nine months which was imposed upon him, very much the same as on all the 
others, but substitute a sentence of five months in his case.

LADY JUSTICE HALLETT: 
 
1. 
This  is  yet  another  tragic  example  of  the  effects  of  gang 
violence.  A fight that began for little reason and lasted less than 
five minutes left one young man dying in the street and several other 
young men incarcerated for many years. The appellant was convicted of 
 
three offences murder, conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm and 
 
violent  disorder.  The  trial  judge  His  Honour  Judge  Hone  QC  ordered 
him to be detained at Her Majesty’s pleasure and specified a period 
of twelve years as a minimum term to be served.  
 
Background 
 
2.  On 8 October 2004 Louis Colley (aged 20) was involved in a minor 
 
dispute  with  some  youths  outside  the  Toffee  Park  Youth  Club  on  St 
Luke's Estate in East London.  The youths plotted their revenge.  On 
Monday  11  October  they  gathered  near  to  the  estate  intent  on 
 
attacking Mr Colley.  Rumours of a fight had reached the Toffee Park 
Youth Club and a large crowd of youths (estimated at up to 40 or 50), 
some intent on violence and some just wishing to watch, gathered in 
Bath Street, a small side road off Old Street. 
 
3.  Mr  Colley  was  confronted  by  Bullabeck  Ring-Biong  and  another 
male.  A third male, Scott White, launched the attack by trying to 
punch  Mr  Colley. 
Mr  Colley  fought  back.    However,  he  was  then 

  
 
 

1
--------
surrounded and attacked by a number of males.  He fell to the ground 
and was set upon with fists, feet and weapons.  Witnesses described 
seeing  baseball  bats  and  at  least  one  knife.    One  witness,  Bilel 
Khelfa,  described  seeing  a  baseball  bat  with  a  screw  or  nail 
protruding from its end.  Mr Essayas Kassahun, a friend of Mr Colley, 
bravely went to his aid.  Mr Colley managed to free himself.  He ran 
 
around the corner into Old Street, where he was brought to the ground 
near  a  branch  of  Somerfield.  He  escaped  a  second  time  and  took 
 
refuge inside the store. 
 
4.  Sadly, Essayas Kassahun was not so fortunate.  During the melee 
which  now  focused  on  him,  someone  struck  him  on  the  head  with  a 
sharp, thin object which penetrated his skull.  The attackers rapidly 
made their escape, some on bicycles. 
 
5.  Mr Kassahun, bleeding heavily, was helped across Old Street to a 
nearby Shell garage.  Police and ambulance attended, but Mr Kassahun 
 
had lost consciousness by the time they arrived.  He never regained 
it.  He was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead two days 
later. 
The  extent  of  surgical  intervention  meant  that  the 
pathologist  who  performed  the  post-mortem  upon  him  could  not 
determine with any degree of certainty the nature of the weapon used, 
other than it was of a sharp, penetrating kind rather than a blunt 
object.  It could have been a knife or a modified baseball bat. 
 
 
6.  A trail of Mr Kassahun's blood from the Bath Street road sign to 

 

  
 
 

2
--------
the corner of Old Street and across Old Street suggested that he had 
sustained his fatal injury in Bath Street. 
 
7.  It will surprise no one to learn that the eyewitness evidence, 
coming as it did from several young people at the scene, provided a 
variety  of  accounts.  This  was  a  fast-moving,  short-lived  incident 
 
which  took  place  at  night  and  under  artificial  lighting.    A  large 
number of people were involved, none of whom stayed in one place for 
long. 
Most  of  the  attackers  had  attempted  to  disguise  their 
features, for example by using the hoods of their hoodies.  It was 
frightening  and  distressing  for  witnesses,  particularly  those  who 
knew the victims. 
 
8.  It is necessary to rehearse in a little more detail the accounts 
 
given  by  four  of  those  witnesses  for  reasons  that  will  become 
apparent when we turn to the grounds of appeal.  First, Gary Rees. He 
was a friend of both Louis Colley and the deceased.  He was tendered 
 
by the prosecution at trial and cross-examined regarding an assertion 
in his witness statement that he saw the deceased being hit with a 
baseball bat to his left temple.  He told the jury that he had seen a 
bat but did not see it being used on the deceased.  He was described 
by the judge as an ""unsatisfactory witness"". 
 
9.  Christopher Bissett and his brother were originally arrested as 
suspects.  They  were  later  reclassified  as  witnesses.    Christopher 
Bissett was called to give evidence in relation to Dwayne Mayers who, 

  
 
 

3
--------
he claimed, had a baseball bat with which he hit the deceased on the 
head.  He  also  told  the  jury  of  conversations  with  his  neighbour, 
 
Ring-Biong, who  confessed  to  him  that  he  had  stabbed  the  deceased, 
thrown the knife away and burnt his clothes.  Initially, Christopher 
 
Bissett did not recall having seen weapons other than bats during the 
incident, but later said that he had seen what he believed to be a 
knife  in  Ring-Biong's  hand.    Bissett  described  the  appellant  as  a 
friend and insisted throughout that the appellant was not present at 
 
the incident and took no part.  Bissett appears to have been another 
unsatisfactory  witnesses.    The  judge  commented  that  obtaining  his 
 
 
evidence had been ""like drawing teeth"".  The judge warned the jury to 
approach the whole of Bissett's evidence, including the parts which 
potentially  exculpated  the  appellant,  with  caution  because  Bissett 
may have had an improper motive in giving evidence, that is a reason 
to lie to protect himself or his brother by deflecting blame on to 
others. 
 
10.  We turn to the identification evidence which was at the heart of 
the  case  against  the  appellant.    Three  officers,  PC  Redknap,  PC 
Dearden and PC Davis were amongst a number of officers who attended 
promptly in response to calls for the emergency services.  They saw 
 
and  spoke  to  Phoebe  Henville,  who  was  still  at  the  Shell  petrol 
station.  She was then aged 17.  She told PC Redknap that there had 
 
been  a  fight  between  youths  at  the  petrol  station  and  the  Murray 
Grove boys.  She had seen a black male hit the deceased over the head 
 
with a baseball bat.  She told PC Dearden that she had seen about 30 

  
 
 

4
--------
black males and some white males attack Mr Kassahun and that one of 
the  males  had  struck  him  to  the  head  with  a  baseball  bat.    She 
indicated that the Somerfield store was the scene of the attack.  She 
named  three  people  involved:  ""Beku""  (Ring-Biong),  ""Pellan""  (Pellum 
 
McCook), and Kennedy (Kennedy Mwesezi).  She told PC Davis that she 
had seen 50 youths surrounding someone at the junction of Bath Street 
 
 
and Old Street.  She saw them punching and kicking before one of the 
males drew a baseball bat and hit the victim with it.  She did not 
 
 
name the person under attack as Mr Kassahun.  She told PC Davis that 
three people were involved: Jamie Martin, Danny Martin and Bullabeck. 
 
It  was  made  clear  to  Miss  Henville  that  she  may  be  an  important 
witness.  She  was  told  to  go  home  and  to  await  collection  by  an 
officer. 
 
11.  Miss Henville was interviewed at length and into the early hours 
of  the  following  morning.    In  her  statement  dated  12  October, 
 
extracted from what she said in interview, she identified four of the 
 
appellant's  co-accused,  Danny  and  Jamie  Martin,  Pellum  McCook  and 
Kennedy  Mwesezi,  as  having  taken  part  in  the  incident.    She  again 
referred to a black youth holding a baseball bat who, she said, had 
been smirking.  She made no mention of the appellant or of a white 
young man with distinctive features whom she recognised but could not 
name, albeit she was later to claim that, within ten minutes of the 
 
fight,  she  had  heard  that  someone  called  Sam  was  involved  or  to 
blame. 
She  was  pressed  on  whether  she  could  provide  any  more 
 
 
information  which  might  be  helpful  to  the  police  to  catch  the 

  
 
 

5
--------
attackers of her former boyfriend.  She said: ""No, not really. .... 
These were the ones in the group causing the trouble"".  She insisted 
that she did not recognise any faces.  She said that she ""fixed on"" 
the black boy walking past with the bat and the smirk. 
 
12.  On 13 October there was a chance meeting with the appellant in 
 
the  street  at  about  7.15pm.    The  following  day  Miss  Henville  was 
again  interviewed  by  the  police.    She  told  them  that  she  and  her 
friend, Sarah Beattie, had been walking down the street when they saw 
the  appellant.  Sarah  Beattie  told  her  the  appellant's  name.    She 
said that she recognised him as someone who had been involved in the 
attack.  She  referred  to  his  being  distinctive  and  having  strange 
 
features,  as  if  there  was  something  wrong  with  him.  She  said  he 
looked ""possibly disabled"" and that he had dark brown hair.  She also 
 
said that he was someone she had seen around ""always on the street 
causing trouble"".  She said, ""There's a couple of them been known for 
nicking mopeds"". There is nothing in the material put before us to 
suggest  that  any  part  of  that  description fits the  appellant, save 
for the fact that he has dark brown hair. 
 
13.  Unfortunately,  a  close  analysis  of  the  interview reveals that 
Miss Henville's purported immediate recognition of the appellant as 
one  of  the  boys  who  attacked  Essayas  Kassahun  was  prompted  by  two 
leading questions from the interviewing officers.  In the statement 
that  followed  she  again  described  the  man  as  being  distinctive 
 
looking  with  ""weird  strange  features"".    She  then  picked  out  the 

  
 
 

6
--------
appellant  on  a  video identification  procedure  ""as  the  male  you  saw 
attacking Essayas later named as Sam Hallam"".  Yet, curiously, in her 
statement of identification she purported to identify him ""as part of 
the group that attacked Essayas who had with him a baseball bat"".  It 
 
 
was not clear to us from where the addition of the bat had come.  It 
was plainly a mistake. 
 
14.  In evidence at trial, Miss Henville described an incident which 
 
began with shouting in the middle of Bath Street and which moved to 
Old Street, towards the Somerfield shop.  She said she followed and 
saw a crowd outside Somerfield.  The crowd appeared to be attacking a 
person  in  the  middle.    She  could  not  see  who  it  was.    She  saw  a 
 
baseball bat go up and down a few times, but she could not say if it 
was used to strike anyone.  She saw only one bat.  The others, she 
 
 
thought, were using their fists.  She was able to recognise people 
only as they left the crowd.  She said that she saw Danny and Jamie 
 
Martin. 
 
15.  When summarising her evidence to the jury the judge interposed 
at this stage that she may well have been describing the attack on 
Colley and not the attack on Essayas.  The trail of Essayas' blood 
suggested that she  had  the  wrong  location.    However,  Miss  Henville 
insisted that after the group split up she realised that the person 
 
on the ground was Essayas.  She said that he was helped up and taken 
to the Shell garage.  She saw people walking away and a short black 
boy  standing  on  the  wall  holding  a  bat.    She  then  went  to  the 

  
 
 

7
--------
deceased and called an ambulance. 
 
16.  Initially in her evidence Miss Henville made no mention of the 
appellant,  but  was  prompted  to  do  so  by  prosecuting  counsel  in 
perfectly  proper  fashion.    She  described  how  on  the  evening  of  13 
October she was with Sarah Beattie when they saw the appellant in the 
street.  She said that she had heard the name Sam Hallam mentioned 
and had seen his face, but had not been able to put a face to the 
 
name.  She claimed to have recognised him as someone she had seen in 
the crowd outside Somerfield  on  11  October  attacking  the  person  in 
the middle.  She said that she did not see exactly what he was doing, 
but  she  saw  him  coming  away  from  the  crowd.    She  did  not  put  any 
 
weapon in his hand.  She told the jury that she had spoken to police 
at the petrol station after the incident and had given them the names 
of those people she had seen present at the incident. 
 
17.  Cross-examined on behalf of the appellant, Miss Henville agreed 
 
that  she  had  heard  a  rumour  from  a  number  of  people  that  someone 
called  Sam  had  been  involved.    When  they  saw  the  appellant  on  13 
October Sarah Beattie told her his name was Sam Hallam.  It was after 
this that she told police that Sam Hallam had been involved in the 
incident.  Asked why she had not earlier told the police that there 
had been a white boy whom she had recognised but could not put a name 
 
to, she said ""Because I didn't know his name"".  She said that she had 
concentrated upon those she knew.   
 

  
 
 

8
--------
18.  She  said  that  on  11 October  she  had  been  about  five  feet  away 
from  the  crowd,  although  the  judge  commented  that  it was obviously 
 
more.  Albeit nobody asked her for how long she had the appellant in 
her sights, the judge later suggested it must have been for less than 
 
five  minutes,  In  truth,  it  was  probably  no  more  than  a  matter  of 
seconds. 
 
19.  Miss Henville told the jury that the appellant was one of the 
 
earlier ones to break away from the group around the deceased.  He 
left  just  after  she  had  seen  the  baseball  bat  being  raised  in  the 
middle of the group.  She could not say if he left on foot or on a 
bicycle, but he walked towards her.  She could not recall the colour 
of his hair, albeit she agreed that she had described the appellant, 
whom  she  had  seen  on  the  13th,  as  having  untidy,  dark  brown  hair. 
 
 
She did not recall telling Sarah Beattie the man whom she had seen on 
11  October  was  wearing  a  hoodie  with  blond  hair  peeping  out  from 
 
 
underneath  the  hood.  It  was  put  to  her  that  other  people  had  put 
forward the name Sam and that when Sarah Beattie told her, as they 
passed the appellant, that he was Sam Hallam, she had thought that he 
 
 
must be the Sam people were saying had been there.  She said, ""I saw 
someone  who  looked  like  him.    If  it  wasn't  him,  I  saw  someone  who 
 
looked like him"".  Asked, ""So the position is it may not have been 
him but someone who looked like him?"", she replied, ""Yes"".  Later she 
 
said, ""I saw someone that looked like him running towards me and when 
I was talking to people they told me it was a Sam, and someone told 
 
 
me it was Sam Hallam and Sarah pointed him out to me"".  She agreed 

  
 
 

9
--------
that  she  could  not  be  sure  that  it  was  the  appellant  whom  she  had 
seen on the 11th.  She did not recall telling PC Redknap that she had 
seen  the  deceased  being  hit  over  the  head  by  a  baseball  bat  by  a 
black male.  She said that if she said that,  it must have been in 
confusion.  She  agreed  that  it  was  her  impression  that  after  the 
group had come away the small black youth whom she saw holding the 
 
bat  was  showing  off  as  if  he  had  been  the  one  who  had  caused  the 
damage. 
 
20.  Passages from her police interview were put to her.  She agreed 
 
 
that  it  appeared  from  them  that  her  understanding  at  the  time  had 
been that a small black youth holding a bat had hit the deceased, and 
that he was the only person she saw with a weapon.  When she saw the 
appellant on the 13th she did not recall telling Sarah Beattie that 
he had been holding a bat.  She agreed that had she done so, this 
would  not  have  been  right.    She  also  agreed  that,  having  told  the 
 
police  that  the  appellant  was  involved,  she  then  told  Bilel  Khelfa 
that someone called Sam Hallam was involved. Cross-examined further, 
Miss Henville agreed that in her police interview she had said that 
she did not recognise anyone who was fighting within the group.   
 
21.  Finally, in re-examination she said that there had been a group 
of  people  around  someone  in  the  middle.    They  were  attacking, 
throwing punches and kicking.  This was outside Somerfield.  She saw 
a baseball bat come up a few times.  There were about fifteen people 
 
attacking and  about fifteen watching.  She  saw  Jamie  Martin,  Danny 

  
 
 

10
--------
Martin and the person she believed to be the appellant move from the 
huddle,  although  there  appears  to  have  been  some  confusion  as  to 
whether the witness understood the word ""huddle"" to mean simply those 
attacking or those attacking and watching.  She said that after they 
 
saw the appellant in the street two days later, Sarah had told her to 
telephone  Gary  (Gary  Rees)  who  had  the  telephone  number  for  the 
 
police  officers  dealing  with  the  case.    When  she  called  Gary  she 
learned that the deceased had died.  She felt upset and angry.  Asked 
whether at that stage she had any doubt that the appellant was the 
person she had seen at the incident, she said ""No, I was just looking 
for someone to blame on the spot really"".  Asked, ""Did you believe 
you had seen him on the 11th?"", she replied ""Yes"".   
 
22.  Sarah Beattie was not present at the incident on 11 October, but 
she  said  that  she  had  known  the  appellant  for  about  a  year.    When 
Phoebe Henville saw him on the 15th, she (Phoebe) became distressed 
and  they  telephoned  a  boy  they  knew.    During  that  telephone  call 
 
Phoebe learned that the deceased had died and became very emotional. 
 
 
She said that after they had passed the appellant in the street he 
kept turning round and looking at Phoebe.  They saw him a short time 
 
later and Phoebe asked him, ""Are you proud of what you have done?"" 
 
He  asked,  ""What?""  Miss  Beattie  said  ""You  are  a  murderer"".    He 
She  also  alleged  that  the  appellant 
grinned  in  an  evil  way. 
threatened them both and said that he would petrol bomb her house. 
 
 
23.  Cross-examined  on  behalf  of  the  appellant,  Miss  Beattie  said 

 

  
 
 

11
--------
that Phoebe had told her that the appellant was the one holding the 
bat,  and  that  the  one  called  Sam  was  ""kind  of  chubby""  and  pale. 
 
Although he had his hood up, she could still see his blond hair.  She 
agreed that in her witness statement of 21 October she had made no 
mention  of  any  threat  of  a  petrol  bomb,  which  Phoebe  had  not 
mentioned either, but said that she had mentioned that the appellant 
 
 
had threatened her, saying that he knew where she and her brothers 
lived. 
 
24.  What we now know, but was not known at trial, is that at 7.30pm 
 
 
on 13 October, Gary Rees left a message for the police to the effect 
that there was a rumour going about that a Sam Bass was responsible 
for the attack, and an address was given which was probably Sam Bass' 
address.  At 10.30pm Rees rang again to say that the name Sam Bass 
was  a  mistake;  the  name  should  have  been  Sam  Allen  (sic)  who  was 
“holding the bat with the nail in the end”.   
 
 
25.  The other evidence of identification upon which the prosecution 
purported to rely came from Bilel Khelfa.  He, too, was a friend of 
Louis Colley and Essayas Kassahun.  Unfortunately, his identification 
of the appellant was not independent of Phoebe Henville. When first 
seen Mr Khelfa, also failed to mention Sam Hallam whom he knew and 
with  whom  he  had  been  at  school.  He  added  Sam  Hallam's  name  only 
 
after Phoebe and others told him that Sam was involved.   
 
 
26. When first seen on 13 October he described seeing a large group 

  
 
 

12
--------
of youths hanging out near the football pitch outside Godfrey House. 
 
He recognised, he said, just two of the attackers.  One was Ring-
Biong and the other a ""skinny white boy"" aged 19 to 20 who lived in 
Murray Grove.  He could not recall any other features of this male, 
 
save that he was wearing a jacket and a hood.  The initial approach, 
he said, was made to Louis Colley in Bath Street by Ring-Biong and 
another  black  youth.    A  light-skinned  Jamaican  boy  threw  the  first 
punch  at  Colley.  When  the  attack  on  Colley  began  he  noticed  that 
 
three or four people had baseball bats.  He recalled another white 
boy.  This one was on a silver BMX bike, wearing a grey hooded top, 
with blondish hair protruding from the hood.  This boy (whom he did 
not  say  he  recognised)  was  in  possession  of  a  baseball  bat  with  a 
silver screw protruding from the end.  The bat was said to be about 
15  to  20  inches  long,  thinner  at  one  end,  with  some  kind  of  black 
tape  wrapped  around  it.    Bilel  Khelfa  was  the  only  witness  to 
describe a modified bat of that kind.  He was repeatedly pressed, not 
 
surprisingly,  by  the  officers  for  as  much  information  as  he  could 
provide.  He said nothing about Sam Hallam. 
 
  
27.  Mr Khelfa was re-interviewed by the police on 20 October 2004. 
By  this  time  Essayas  had  sadly  died.  Mr  Khelfa  had  been  told  by 
 
Phoebe Henville that the boy responsible was Sam Hallam.  He now said 
this: ""I saw a white boy, who I mentioned in my last statement, with 
 
 
the  baseball  bat  arrive  on  his  bike.    I  said  in  my  last  interview 
that  I  recognised  the  boy  but  could  not  remember  his  name.    Since 
that interview I have been reminded of his name by Phoebe.  As soon 

  
 
 

13
--------
as I was reminded of the boy's name I knew that the boy with the bat 
was  Sam  Hallam"". 
Unfortunately,  this  was  a  significant 
 
misrepresentation by the witness of what he had said before.  As we 
have indicated, he had never said he recognised the boy on the bike 
 
with the bat, despite being pressed.  This was to lead prosecuting 
counsel unwittingly into error later in the proceedings.  Mr Khelfa 
proffered the  explanation that he  had  revised  his  account when his 
friend had died and he had begun to take the incident more seriously. 
 
This  was  despite  the  fact  that  he  had  known  all  along  that  his 
friend was grievously injured and was laying in a coma in hospital. 
 
He  claimed  that  what  had  happened  had  shocked  him  and  that  in  his 
initial interviews he had done what he could to help the police find 
the  attackers  of  his  friend.    In  his  new  account  he  provided  a 
different sequence of events.  He claimed that the appellant, whom he 
had  known  from  school,  had  been  one  of  those  who  attacked  the 
deceased. 
This  time  he  said  that  the  appellant  was  ""virtually 
standing over him, going to hit him"".  He also described Ring-Biong 
as one of the attackers.  When he gave this statement he said that he 
was  a  hundred  per  cent  positive  in  his  identifications  of  the 
appellant and Ring-Biong. 
 
 
28.  At trial the prosecution elicited his account with difficulty. 
The judge described him as being ""deliberately unhelpful"" and allowed 
 
the prosecution to treat him as a hostile witness.  In evidence he 
said  that  he  had  seen  Ring-Biong  and  a  white  youth  approach  Louis 
 
Colley  on  bikes.  The  white  youth  was  wearing  a  ""GAP""  jumper.    He 

  
 
 

14
--------
could  not  see  his  face  properly  because  his  hood  was  up.    He  said 
that  he  and  the  deceased  went  forward  with  Louis  when  they  called 
 
Louis  over.  A  third  youth  punched  Louis  and  there  was  a  bit  of 
fighting.  He helped Louis up and they ran to Somerfield.  Someone 
 
got Louis again and Louis went down to the ground.  A group of about 
ten,  which  included  Ring-Biong,  rushed  Louis,  and  another  group 
rushed the deceased in Bath Street.  He could not see the deceased, 
but he could see a group surrounding someone and assumed that it must 
 
 
be the deceased as only he, Louis and the deceased had been there. 
Both ""rushings"" were still going on when Ring-Biong chased him away. 
 
  
 
29. He said that he did not know anyone in the group which surrounded 
the  deceased.  At  the  time  of  the  initial  attack  on  Louis  in  Bath 
 
Street  one  of  those  fighting  had  a  long  baseball  bat  with  a  nail 
sticking out at the end.  The bat had come from someone's trousers 
when  he  (Khelfa),  Louis  and  the  deceased  were  together  at  the 
  
beginning of the incident.  The person with the bat was on a bike. 
He was one of the first two people who had arrived on bikes, wearing 
 
a hoodie.  He did not see him use the bat.  That was the only bat he 
saw.  He was asked again if he knew the person with the bat and said 
 
""No"".  He said that he had not been able to look at his face properly 
because he was wearing a hoodie.  He repeatedly said that he was not 
 
 
sure as to who the person was.  He did not recall identifying anyone 
other than Ring-Biong at the police identification procedure.   
 

  
 
 

15
--------
30.  The  judge  allowed  him  to  refresh  his  memory  from  his  police 
statements.  He said that the person with the baseball bat with the 
 
protruding nail had been wearing Nike tracksuit bottoms and a hood. 
He said that he had seen the appellant, a white boy with whom he was 
 
 
at  school,  two  days  earlier  and  he  had  thought  it  was  him.    He 
identified the appellant in a police identification procedure.  When 
he  was  asked  whether  that identification was accurate and  what the 
appellant was doing, he said "".... obviously I don't want to lie in 
court  now"".  He  said  that  he  had  only  said  it  was  the  appellant 
because the attacker was wearing the same clothes as he had seen the 
appellant wearing.  The appellant was the only white boy he knew.  He 
told the jury that he was not really sure that the attacker was the 
appellant.  He did not see the attacker's face properly.   
 
The  Crown  was  given  leave  to  cross-examine  Mr  Khelfa  as  a 
31. 
hostile witness.  His statement of 20 October was put to him on the 
basis  that  he  had  originally  said  that  the  boy  on  the  bike  was 
 
someone he recognised but could not put a name to.  That, as we have 
indicated,  was  an  error.  In  summing-up  to  the  jury  the  judge 
indicated  that  Mr  Khelfa  ""agreed  with  what  he  had  said  in  the 
statement"". 
He  commented  ""in  his  second  witness  statement,  with 
which  he  agreed  in  the  witness  box  ....""    This  does  not  appear 
accurately to record the witness's evidence, as was observed by the 
Court  of  Appeal  Criminal  Division  at  the  original  appeal.    They 
declared that on a fair reading of Mr Khelfa's evidence, he persisted 
in  asserting  that  he  did  not,  in  fact,  see  the  face  of  the  young 

  
 
 

16
--------
white male and therefore was unable to identify him as the appellant. 
 
In  the  judgment  of  the  court  on  that  occasion  the  witness  had 
remained  equivocal  as  to  what  he  did  and  did  not  accept  in  his 
statement and therefore the judge's comment went a little too far. 
 
32.  Cross-examined on behalf of the appellant, Mr Khelfa agreed that 
during  the  police  interview  from  which  his  statement  of  13  October 
had been drawn up, he could not give the name of the person he saw 
 
with the bat and he had told police specifically that he had never 
looked at that person.  He said that he did not know who it was until 
Phoebe told him. 
 
33. Thus, neither identifying witness upon whom reliance was placed 
in  fact  provided  clear  and  unequivocal  evidence  and  one,  Bifel 
Khelfa, attempted to play down his purported identification as best 
he could. 
 
 
33.  We turn to the appellant's alibi.  It has to be said that his 
inability or unwillingness two days later to say where he was at the 
 
time of the murder has not exactly helped his cause.  He was alerted 
to the accusations by the two girls on 13 October.  When arrested on 
 
 
20 October 2004 at his home address he told the police that he had 
been expecting them because he knew what the girls had been saying. 
 
 
He told officers that he had not been present at the incident.  He 
had been playing football with a friend, Timmy Harrington.   
 

  
 
 

17
--------
Timmy  Harrington  was  interviewed  by  police  following  that 
34. 
assertion.  Mr Harrington denied that the appellant had been with him 
 
at  the  time  of  the  incident.  In  a  statement  dated  20  October  he 
maintained  that  on  that  date  he  had  worked  a  night  shift.    In  a 
 
second  statement,  after  checks  revealed  that  he  had  not  worked  a 
night shift, he maintained that he was nevertheless sure that he had 
not been with the appellant. 
 
 
35.  In  evidence,  Mr  Harrington  said  that  on  11  October  2004  he 
finished work, collected his sister's dog from her house and took it 
 
home.  He  insisted  that  he  had  not  seen  the  appellant  that  night. 
The  appellant  was  a  friend  of  his.    They  used  to  play  football 
 
together in the evenings, but he denied that he had done so on the 
11th.  He also denied that the appellant had asked him to say that 
 
 
they had been together on the 11th.  He was asked ""How clear are you 
in  terms  of  are  you  saying  definitely  not,  possibly  or  what?""    He 
 
replied ""It is possibly I was not"".   
 
36.  The Crown then applied for, and was granted, leave to treat him 
 
as a hostile witness but apparently did not need to cross-examine him 
to elicit the evidence in accordance with his proof.  His statements 
were put to him to refresh his memory.  He insisted that he had not 
seen the appellant at all in the week prior to 13 October.  He was 
 
positive that he had not seen the appellant on the 11th and had not 
played football that night. 
 

  
 
 

18
--------
On  his  arrest  the  appellant  had  had  with  him  two  mobile 
38. 
telephones. 
At  least  one  of  them  was  with  him  when  he  was 
interviewed.  We  now  know  that  it  could  have  been  of  assistance  to 
him. 
However,  the  appellant  exercised  his  right  to  silence 
 
throughout his interviews on the advice of his legal representative 
and did not draw attention to the mobile phone.  With the benefit of 
 
 
hindsight  maintaining  his  silence  was  perhaps  not  in  his  best 
interests.  He declined to provide even his telephone number, which 
would not have taken much effort to retrieve.   
 
39.  However,  eventually,  in  his  final  interview,  the  appellant 
provided  a  prepared  statement.    By  that  time  he  was  aware  that  Mr 
Harrington  had  denied  having  been  with  him.    In  his  prepared 
statement he denied presence or involvement in the incident.  He said 
that if he had not been with Mr Harrington, he must have been at home 
babysitting his sister whilst his mother was at bingo, as he usually 
did on Monday nights. The appellant's case at trial was in accordance 
 
He  remained  unsure  as  to  his 
with  his  prepared  statement. 
whereabouts. The Crown did not invite an inference to be drawn from 
 
his silence in interview given his age and the fact that he had been 
legally advised. 
 
40.  There was no forensic evidence which implicated the appellant. 
 
Nor was there evidence from CCTV or phone cell site analysis which 
placed  the  appellant  at  or  near  the  scene  of  the  incident.    A 
schedule of phone calls was produced to show contact between his co-

 

  
 
 

19
--------
accused; it did not include any calls from the appellant. Not one of 
the  other  co-accused  who  stood  trial  with  the  appellant  implicated 
him either at trial or in the course of their interviews, and not one 
of them suggested that he was present at the incident.  The appellant 
 
was the only one of those to stand trial who claimed that he was not 
present. 
 
41.  The  prosecution  suggested  that  the  appellant  had  deliberately 
 
concocted  a  false  alibi  in  relation  to  Mr  Harrington  and  had  lied 
about having never been arrested.  This was said to be the supporting 
evidence for the identification evidence.   
 
42.  The appellant was originally jointly charged in all counts with 
Scott  White,  Dwayne  Mayers,  Bullabeck  Ring-Biong,  Pellum  McCook, 
Jamie Martin, Danny Martin and Jermaine Makinde.  Kennedy Mwesezi was 
severed  from  the  main  indictment  following  applications  by  the  co-
accused.  It  had  been  intended  that  he  should  be  tried  separately 
following  the  main  trial,  but  in  the  event  the  Crown  offered  no 
evidence against him. 
 
43. Of the co-accused whose cases on count 1 (murder) were left to 
 
the jury, their cases were as follows.  White's case was that he had 
acted alone when he punched Louis Colley, not as part of a group; he 
 
had no idea that anyone had a weapon.  Mayers' case was that the jury 
could  not  be  sure  of  guilt  because  the  sole  witness  against  him 
(Bissett) was demonstrably unreliable and inconsistent.  Ring-Biong's 

  
 
 

20
--------
case  was  that  he  had  been  acting  as  a  peacemaker  and  had  not 
participated in any violence.  The cases for Pellum McCook and Jamie 
 
and  Danny  Martin  on  count  2  (conspiracy  to  commit  grievous  bodily 
harm) and count 3 (violent disorder) were that they were spectators 
only  and  not  participants  in  the  violence.    Phoebe  Henville  was 
described as a ""key witness"" in each of the cases of McCook and the 
Martin brothers. 
 
44.  At the conclusion of the trial at the Central Criminal Court on 
26 October 2005 as we have indicated the appellant was convicted of 
 
all three counts: murder, conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm 
and violent disorder.  White was acquitted of murder by the jury, but 
convicted on counts 2 and 3.  Mayers was acquitted by the jury on all 
counts.  Ring-Biong was convicted on all three counts.  McCook and 
Jamie and Danny Martin were acquitted on count 1 at the direction of 
the  judge,  and  by  the  jury  on  the  remaining  counts. 
The  judge 
acceded  to  a  submission  of  no  case  to  answer  on  all  the  counts 
against Makinde. 
 
45.  The appellant was granted leave to appeal against conviction by 
the  full  court  in  October  2006  on  the  basis  that  the  judge  was 
 
arguably wrong to have refused to accede to a submission of no case 
to answer made on his behalf.  The appeal was dismissed on 22 March 
2007  on  the  basis  that  the  identification  evidence  was  sufficient 
coming  apparently  as  it  did  from  two  sources,  and  in  any  event 
supported by the fact that the appellant had deliberately put forward 

  
 
 

21
--------
a false alibi. 
 
 
46.  The appellant now appeals against conviction upon a Reference by 
the Criminal Cases Review Commission (“CCRC”)under section 9 of the 
Criminal  Appeal  Act  1995.    The  Commission  had  a  number  of  general 
concerns  which  can  be  summarised  as  follows.    First:  no  witness 
 
(besides Miss Henville and Mr Khelfa) put the appellant at the scene 
of the incident.  Despite an intensive investigation there was still 
 
no evidence to implicate him in the offences.  Second, there was no 
evidence of relevant telephone traffic involving the appellant on the 
 
night  in  question,  yet  there  was  in  relation  to  his  co-accused. 
Third,  Miss  Henville's  evidence  was  potentially  unreliable  in  a 
number  of  respects,  particularly the location  of the attack on the 
Fourth,  there  may  have  been  failings  in  the  police 
deceased. 
 
investigation and the approach to disclosure.   
 
47.  The CCRC has referred the case to this court principally on the 
 
basis of fresh evidence, which it is said raises substantial doubts 
as  to  the  circumstances  and  reliability  of  the  identification  or 
 
recognition  of  the  appellant  by  the  two  key  Crown  witnesses,  Miss 
Henville and Mr Khelfa.  In particular the Commission relied upon:   
 

(i)  the  two  police  messages  which  record  the  receipt  of  the 
information from Gary Rees and which were not disclosed to the 
defence; 
 

  
 
 

22
--------
(ii) material which was not disclosed to the defence in relation 
to a police search of the home of an uncharged suspect (a black 
 
male  named  Tyrone  Isaacs),  named  by  Ring-Biong  in  evidence  as 
having been with him at the start of the incident.  When Isaacs' 
 
 
home was searched on his arrest on 24 November 2004 police found 
a mobile telephone that lacked a back, as did the telephone lost 
 
 
by  Mr  Colley  during  the  incident.    They  also  found  a  broom 
handle with a nail protruding from its end. 

 

 
 

  
 
 

 
(iii)  Evidence  from  the  appellant’s  mobile  phone  which 
 
suggested both his and Harrington’s memories were at fault 
and  the  alibi  may  not  have  been  dishonest.  Post-trial 
 
analysis of the appellant's mobile telephone has revealed 
previously undiscovered material, including photographs of 
 
taken  on  the  afternoon  of  11  October  at  the  home  of  the 
appellant's  grandmother,  and  of  the  appellant's  father 
(now  deceased)  at  the  George  and  Vulture  public  house  at 
 
18.41.  The  phone’s  memory  also  contains  a  photograph  of 
Timmy  Harrington  taken  on  the  afternoon/  evening  of  12 
 
October 20024. It is said that these photographs may have 
provided  support  for  the  appellant's  contention  that  he 
 
was elsewhere on the night of the incident and provide a 
credible explanation for his belief that he was with Timmy 
Harrington. 

(iv)  Potential fresh evidence from Makinde to the effect 

23
--------
that,  as  he  has  always  maintained,  he  saw  the  appellant 
standing outside the George and Vulture public house after 
 
he (Makinde) left the scene of the incident, that he told 
the  appellant  about  the  incident,  and  that  the  appellant 
told him that he had been at his grandmother's house. 

Potential  fresh  evidence  from  Mwesezi  that  the 
(v) 
appellant  was  not  present  at  the  incident.    Further,  his 
account  of  the  sequence  of  events  might  undermine  Phoebe 
Henville's  account  and  suggest  that  she  could  not  have 
 
seen the attack upon the deceased. 

 
 

 
48.  The  appellant  now  has  the  benefit  of  being  represented  by  Mr 
Henry  Blaxland  QC  and  Mr  Peter  Wilcock  QC.  They  were  not  trial 
counsel.  Mr Blaxland based his primary submissions on the well-known 
decision  in  R  v  Turnbull  [1977]  QB  224.  Mr  Blaxland  reminded  the 
court  of  two  important  passages  of  the  judgment  in  Turnbull.  The 
first is at page 229H: 
 
 

 

""When  in  the  judgment  of  the  trial  judge  the 
quality of the identifying evidence is poor, as 
 
for example when it depends solely on a fleeting
glance  or  on  a  longer  observation  made  in 
 
difficult  conditions,  the  situation  is  very
 
different.  The  judge  should  then  withdraw  the
case  from  the  jury  and  direct  an  acquittal, 
 
unless  there  is  other  evidence  which  goes  to
support the correctness of the identification."" 

 
 
 
The second is at page 220G: 
 
 
  
 
 

24
--------
""Care  should  be  taken  when  directing  the  jury
 
 
about  the  support  for  an  identification  which
may be derived from the fact they have rejected 
an alibi.  False alibis may be put forward for
 
many reasons.  An accused, for example, who has 
only  his  own  truthful  evidence  to  rely  on,  may 
stupidly  fabricate  an  alibi  and  get  lying
witnesses to support it out of fear that his own 
 
evidence  will  not  be  enough.    Further,  alibi
witnesses can make genuine mistakes about dates 
and  occasions,  like  any  other  witness  can.    It 
is  only  when  the  jury  are  satisfied  that  the
 
sole  reason  for  the  fabrication  was  to  deceive 
them and there is no other reason for its being 
put forward can fabrication provide any support 
for identification evidence.  The jury should be
 
reminded that proving the accused has told lies
about where he was at the material time does not 
by  itself  prove  that  he  was  where  the 
identifying witness says he was."" 

 
 
 
49.  Mr Blaxland summarised the appeal in this way: 
 
 
 
 

 

""This is a case which has some of the familiar 
 
ingredients of a miscarriage of justice: flawed 
identification,  flawed  alibi,  non-disclosure,
and failures in the police investigation."" 

 
 
 
He went further and argued that there is a body of evidence to lead 
to the conclusion that, as the appellant claimed from the moment he 
 
was  arrested,  he  was  not  present  at  the  scene  and  is,  therefore, 
innocent  of  the  offences  of  which  he  was  convicted.    Mr  Blaxland 
 
specifically invited the court to make that plain in this judgment. 
He relied upon a passage from the judgment of Lord Judge CJ in R v 
Adams [2011] UKSC 18, [2011] 3 All ER 261 (at paragraph 251) in which 
the  court’s  powers  in  this  respect  are  set  out.  As  will  become 
apparent, we were not satisfied it would be appropriate to use that 

  
 
 

25
--------
power on the facts of this case.   
 
The  appellant's  grounds  of  appeal  are  as  follows.    To  the 
50. 
extent,  if  any,  that  they  deviate  from  the  CCRC's  reasons  for 
referral they require leave, and we give it.  As it seems to us, it 
is essential in a case such as this, which is exceptional, that Mr 
Blaxland is allowed to deploy all lines of argument if necessary.  In 
the event, it proved unnecessary. 
 
51.  The first ground of appeal upon which Mr Blaxland relied was the 
weakness  of  the  identification  evidence. 
Most  of  his  oral 
submissions,  and  those  in  writing,  rightly  focused  on  the 
identification by Miss Henville and Mr Khelfa.  With the assistance 
of  both  Mr  Blaxland  and  Mr  Wilcock,  we  were  able  to  subject  their 
accounts  to  a  focus  far  more  intense  than  has  previously  been  the 
case, either at the trial or at the first appeal.  We have also had 
the  assistance  of  the  investigations  of  the  CCRC  and  the  Thames 
 
Valley  Police.  Mr  Blaxland  submitted  that  on  proper  analysis  the 
evidence was so manifestly unreliable that the appellant's submission 
 
of no case to answer should have been allowed.  In essence this was a 
rerun of the arguments presented to the Court of Appeal on the last 
 
occasion.  However, Mr Blaxland insisted that he was developing the 
argument in a way that had not previously been done.  He submitted, 
as  we  have  already  accepted,  that  this  is  plainly  an  exceptional 
case.  In any event, he now has the benefit of the fresh evidence, to 
 
which  we  shall  come  in  a  moment,  which  undermines,  he  argued,  the 

  
 
 

26
--------
identification evidence and the evidence said to support it.   
 
The  second  ground  of  appeal  relates  to  the  trial  judge's 
52. 
directions.  Originally Mr Blaxland made two complaints.  First, he 
argued that the trial judge failed to direct the jury on the need for 
caution  when  approaching  the  evidence  of  the  witness  Harrington. 
  
This was not a point which we needed to pursue in oral submissions 
because it became apparent that although Mr Hatton QC for the Crown 
obtained the judge's leave to treat Harrington as hostile, he never 
in fact had to do so.  Second, Mr Blaxland submitted that the judge 
wrongly directed the jury about the need for caution when approaching 
the  evidence  of  the  witness  Christopher  Bissett  that  the  appellant 
 
was not at the scene of the crime.  This was a point which was not 
raised in the court below or in this court on the last occasion, or 
 
by the Commission. It comes to this.  Bissett plainly had a motive to 
lie about the involvement of others to deflect blame from himself and 
his  family. 
 
However,  the  same  argument  did  not  apply  to  the 
exculpatory evidence he gave in favour of the appellant.  Therefore 
there was no reason to direct the jury as to the dangers of acting on 
everything  he  said,  as  the  judge  did.    We  saw  some  force  in  this 
submission and we shall return to it later. 
 
53.  The  third  ground  of  appeal  relates  to  the  general  heading  of 
fresh  evidence. 
First,  it  is  said  that  fresh  evidence  is  now 
available from Mwesezi that the appellant was not at the scene of the 
crime.  He  has  provided  a  detailed  account  of  the  attacks  upon  Mr 

  
 
 

27
--------
Colley and the deceased.  He has named the principal participants as 
Ring-Biong,  White,  Dwayne  Mayers,  Jermaine  Makinde  and  Curtley 
Swallow.  He insists that Sam Hallam was not involved.  He has seen 
stills from CCTV footage on the night in question and can identify 
 
some of those present.  His account, if accepted, would suggest that 
Phoebe Henville was not in a position to observe the assault on the 
deceased,  and  would  lend  support  to  the  argument  that  if  she  saw 
anything, it could only have been the attack on Mr Colley. 
 
54. 
When  Mwesezi  was  discharged  from  the  trial  the  appellant's 
defence team sensibly approached his legal team with a view to seeing 
 
whether he would give evidence on behalf of the appellant.  They were 
 
told that he would be advised not to answer any questions because he 
was due to be tried following the conclusion of the trial of the co-
 
accused.  Mr Hatton, on behalf of the Crown, has accepted that this 
provides  a  reasonable  explanation  for  the  failure  to  call  him  at 
trial:  the defence could not do so. 
 
55.  The  next  area  of  fresh  evidence  relied  upon  by  Mr  Blaxland 
 
relates to rumours about the involvement of Sam.  The fresh evidence 
which  is  available  consists  of  the  messages  from  Gary  Rees.    The 
significance  is  said  to  be  that  Gary  Rees  could  have  been  cross-
examined about it.  He was, after all, a prosecution witness.  He is 
 
likely to have said that the information came from Phoebe Henville or 
Sarah Beattie or one of the others involved.  If so, Phoebe Henville 
or  Sarah  Beattie  could  have  been  cross-examined  about  it.    The 

  
 
 

28
--------
message referring to Sam Bass from Gary Rees was sent shortly after 
the confrontation with the appellant in the street on 13 October.  It 
 
is  possible,  therefore,  Mr  Blaxland  argued,  that  they  originally 
thought that the appellant was Sam Bass and not Sam Hallam.  Further, 
the impression given at trial was that the rumours circulating were 
in relation not just to someone called Sam, but specifically to Sam 
 
Hallam.  In fact, Phoebe Henville went so far as to claim that she 
had heard it was Sam Hallam who was involved.  That was how the judge 
summarised her evidence to the jury.  Mr Blaxland argued that there 
was a real danger that the rumour was taken by the jury as providing 
 
further support for the correctness of the identification.  The judge 
omitted to direct the jury that this was not the case.  Mr Blaxland 
submitted that these messages, had they been available to the defence 
team at the time, would have corrected this false impression. 
 
56.  We are not as confident as Mr Blaxland that the messages would 
have been deployed by the defence had they been available.  There may 
 
have been certain dangers, given the contents of the second message. 
 
However,  we  see  some  force  in  Mr  Blaxland's  argument  that  the 
material should at least have been available to the defence team so 
that  they  could  make  their  tactical  decision.    It  may  have  been 
deployed  to  establish,  first,  that  Sam  Hallam  was  not  the  rumoured 
culprit;  and  second,  that  there  was  some  further  possibility  of 
 
collusion between the witnesses as to naming the person they thought 
was  responsible. 
Mr  Blaxland  further  argued  that  the  disclosure 
could have led to the defence’s establishing a connection between a 

  
 
 

29
--------
person rumoured to be involved in the crime and the theft of mopeds, 
through the link to the address provided for Sam Bass.  Had that been 
 
known,  Miss  Henville  could  have  been  cross-examined  about  what  she 
said about seeing the person on the street causing trouble and that 
 
that  person  was  known  for  ""nicking  mopeds"".  As  we  have  indicated, 
this was not a description which fitted the appellant.   
 
57.  Mr  Blaxland  argued  that  the  defence  may  then  have  identified 
Duncan Mulholland as a person linked to Ring-Biong and known to be 
involved  in  the  theft  of  mopeds.    That  inquiry  would  have  led  to 
 
consideration of the CCTV stills from the crime location, and that in 
turn would have led to the identification of a still shown to Mwesezi 
and analysed by an expert in imagery analysis, Robert Butler.  With 
the benefit of Mr Butler's analysis, it could have been put in cross-
examination to Miss  Henville  and  Mr  Khelfa  that  the  selected  image 
was not of the appellant but of one Duncan Mulholland. 
 
 
58.  When  asked  by  the  Thames  Valley  Police  to  examine  the  CCTV 
stills Mr Khelfa said of one of the images (Man A) now considered by 
 
Mr Butler: ""It looks like the appellant, but it isn't him"".  In Mr 
Butler's  expert  opinion  his  analysis  provides  moderate  support  for 
the proposition that Man A is Duncan Mulholland, but no support for 
the contention that Man B is the appellant.  Man A is just one of the 
 
white  faces  in  the  crowd.    Mr  Butler  said  that  one  particular 
difference  between  Man  A  and  Sam  Hallam  cast  considerable  doubt  on 
the possibility that the two were the same. 

  
 
 

30
--------
59.  As  much  as  we  can  see  the  force  of  Mr  Blaxland's  submissions 
about the deployment of the two messages in the first stage of his 
argument,  this  second  stage  seemed  to  us  to  descend  into  somewhat 
speculative territory.  It is clear from the evidence and from the 
CCTV  images  that  a  number  of  white  youths  were  present.    It  was 
always open to the defence to have them examined by an expert.  It 
was always open to the defence, if they felt sufficiently confident 
of their ground, to put to the witness: ""Look at this image.  There 
is someone who looks like the appellant, but it is not him"".  It was 
 
not clear to us, therefore, the extent to which the defence at trial 
were  precluded  from  pursuing  this  line  of  inquiry  by  any  non-
disclosure,  nor  the  extent  to  which  it  would  necessarily  have 
advanced the appellant's case.   
 
60.  Similarly  (albeit  we  understand  the  argument),  we  found  the 
written  submissions  on  the  fresh  evidence  available  in  relation  to 
Tyrone  Isaacs  less  than  compelling.    He  was  named  as  one  of  those 
present at the scene.  When his home was searched some interesting 
items were found, namely the broom handle with the nail at the end 
and the mobile phone.  There is no record of any examination of those 
items and they were returned to him. 
 
 
61.  Two thoughts immediately occur to us.  First, the broom handle 
does not resemble to any great degree the weapons described by the 
 
Second,  it  might  be  thought  that  only  a  cursory 
witnesses. 

  
 
 

31
--------
examination of both at the time would surely have given at least an 
impression of whether they were items of interest.  This looks to us, 
at  first  blush,  like  an  error  in  record  keeping  rather  than 
potentially important exhibits being missed. 
 
62.  However, we bear in mind that Mr Blaxland sought to persuade us 
 
that the defence at trial may have deployed this material at no risk 
to the appellant in an attempt to establish a possible candidate for 
 
the black male originally described by the witnesses, or even simply 
to “muddy the waters” and raise doubts in the minds of the jury as to 
 
the accuracy of the witnesses' accounts. We should add that we did 
not  give  Mr  Blaxland  the  opportunity  to  develop  his  submissions 
orally on this ground because it was not necessary, for reasons that 
are now well known to all. 
 
63.  As far as Makinde is concerned, Mr Blaxland, rather boldly in 
our view, sought to rely upon his statement, although for unexplained 
 
reasons  he  was  not  in  a  position  to  call  him.    On  the  limited 
submissions  and  material  before  us  we  were  not  satisfied  that 
Makinde's statement met the criteria for admission in this court. 
 
 
64.  Mr  Blaxland  placed  greater  faith  in  the  evidence  of  Mwesezi. 
This  was  because  he  would  have  confirmed  the  point  that  the 
 
appellant's defence team was well able to make at trial: that none of 
the co-accused said that the appellant was present.  But, he might 
 
 
also  have  been  able  to  go  further  and  undermine  Miss  Henville's 

  
 
 

32
--------
evidence  and  raise  the  possibility  that  she  had  mistaken  the 
appellant  for  a  youth  who  looked  like  him,  namely  Mulholland. 
 
Mwesezi was present at court but again for reasons known to everyone 
we did not hear from him. 
 
65.  Finally, and most importantly, Mr Blaxland placed heavy reliance 
 
on the evidence relating to the appellant's mobile phone.  Two phones 
were  taken  from  the  appellant  on  his  arrest.    For  reasons  which 
escape us they do not seem to have been interrogated by either the 
investigating officers  or  the  defence  team.  We  can  understand  why 
 
cell site evidence in relation to the use of the phones may have been 
of limited value given the close proximity of the masts, the various 
scenes,  and  the  homes  of  those  involved. 
However,  given  the 
attachment  of  young  and  old  to  their  mobile  phones,  we  cannot 
 
understand  why  someone  from  either  the  investigating  team  or  the 
defence team did not think to examine the phones attributable to the 
appellant.  An analysis of mobile phone evidence played a part in the 
investigation:  see  the  schedule  of  calls  between  the  co-accused  to 
which we have already referred.  
 
66.  Both  the  appellant’s  phones  have  both  now  been  examined.    One 
 
produced  no  results  of  any  interest.    The  other,  a  3G  telephone 
purchased by the appellant about a week before the incident, did.  At 
the time of the murder it was brand new and state of the art.   
 
67.  One reason proffered for the failure to examine the phone was 

  
 
 

33
--------
that in 2004 the Metropolitan Police did not have the technology in-
house  to  examine  3G  telephones. 
However,  given  our  limited 
knowledge, we would have thought that even a cursory check might have 
produced some interesting results.  Further, it might be thought that 
 
the appellant would have alerted his defence team to the fact that he 
had taken photographs on his new phone in the days before and after 
the  murder  which  might  have  jogged  his  memory and helped establish 
his whereabouts.   
 
68.  We are not aware of what the appellant told his lawyers or what 
 
tactical decisions they took.  We can proceed only on the basis that 
the  prosecution  accept  that  this  is  fresh  evidence  which  meets  the 
criteria for admission and receipt by us. 
 
 
69.  We accept that this evidence potentially does three things: it 
puts the appellant at his grandmother's house in the afternoon of 11 
October; it puts him with his father in the George and Vulture public 
house  in  the  early  evening  of  11  October;  and  it  puts  him  with 
Harrington  on  12  October.    Thus,  although  this  evidence  cannot 
establish a positive alibi for the night in question, it raises the 
distinct  possibility  that  both  the  appellant  and  his  alibi  witness 
were mistaken as to the date they were together.  This in turn raises 
the distinct possibility that the alibi was not a concoction on the 
 
part of the appellant to deceive.  It was always, in our judgment, a 
curious feature of this case that a man who had allegedly set about 
establishing  a  false  alibi  in  the  number  of  days  available  to  him 

  
 
 

34
--------
before  his  arrest  did  an  appalling  job  and  failed  even  to  get  his 
alibi witness on side before speaking to the police. 
 
70.  Thus there is now before us significant material which was not 
before  the  trial  judge  or  this  court  on  the  last  occasion  to  the 
effect that, despite Harrington's confident assertion that he did not 
see the appellant in the week leading up to 13 October, he did; he 
saw him on the 12th.  Of course, this does not put the appellant in 
 
Harrington's company on the 11th. 
 
71.  When the hearing began Mr Hatton was prepared to accept that for 
the  most  part  the  fresh  evidence  upon  which  the  appellant  relies 
 
meets the criteria for our receiving it.  He intended to submit that 
it did not undermine the safety of the conviction.  However, as he 
 
heard the arguments develop, as he heard the concerns expressed by Mr 
Blaxland  and  the  independent  concerns  expressed  by  the  individual 
members of this court, he very properly reconsidered his position and 
took instructions.  When we returned after the luncheon adjournment 
yesterday  he  announced  that  the  prosecution  would  no  longer  oppose 
the appeal. 
 
72.  We have read much of what happened at trial.  We wish to state 
that Mr Hatton has acted with conspicuous propriety and moderation at 
 
 
all  times.  His  decision  not  to  oppose  the  appeal  was  in  our  view 
just and fair. However, the decision remains ours.    
 

  
 
 

35
--------
73.  Had  Mr  Hatton  made  any  submissions  to  the  court,  he  would  no 
doubt have reminded us that the prosecution team was faced with two 
 
witnesses who knew the appellant and who put him at the scene of the 
murder of an innocent young man  and participating in the attack upon 
 
that  young  man.  The  appellant  gave  a  firm  alibi  to  the  police, 
having been alerted just two days after the murder to the possibility 
that  he  may  be  questioned.    That  alibi  was  investigated. 
The 
evidence  suggested  to  those  investigating  that  the  appellant  had 
 
tried  to  put  forward  a  false  alibi.    When  it  was  proved  false,  he 
still could not establish his whereabouts, even though it was only a 
matter of weeks after the incident.  The appellant then repeated that 
alibi at trial, despite knowing of Makinde's assertions in interview 
 
that he had seen the appellant outside the George and Vulture some 45 
minutes after the events and that the appellant had told Makinde that 
he  had  been  “at  his  Nan's”.    Yet  the  George  and  Vulture  was  not 
raised  at  any  time  by  or  on  behalf  of  the  appellant;  nor  was  the 
proposition  that  he  had  been  “at  his  Nan's”.   Presumably,  the 
 
 
appellant was well aware that he had owned a new phone on which he 
had taken lots of photographs. 
 
74. Further, for whatever reason, be it distress or well-intentioned 
 
legal advice, the appellant did not help himself in interview, and it 
seems he did not help himself in the witness box.  This was not a 
case  therefore,  in  our  judgment,  in  which  either  the  prosecutor  or 
the  trial  judge  could  conclude  that  there  was  no  evidence  against 
him.  There was evidence of his involvement for the jury to consider, 

  
 
 

36
--------
whatever criticisms could be made of it.  The criticisms went to the 
credibility and reliability of witnesses.  Placing its trust firmly 
 
in  the  jury  system,  this  court  has  said  time  and  time  again  that 
issues  of  credibility  and  reliability  are  primarily  the 
responsibility  of  a  jury  and  that  a  judge  should  be  wary  of 
intervening. 
 
75. 
However,  the  situation  has  now  changed  dramatically.    The 
evidence upon which the prosecution relied to support the identifying 
witnesses,  namely  the  evidence  as  to  false  alibi,  has  been 
significantly undermined.  Had the trial judge and the court on the 
last occasion known what we now know, we doubt that they would have 
reached the conclusions they did.   
 
76.  The  identification  evidence  in  this  case  was  never  very 
satisfactory.    We  note  that  three  accused  against  whom  Phoebe 
 
 
Henville  was  a  key  witness  were  acquitted.    We  have  no  doubt, 
 
therefore,  that  the  jury  looked  for  support  of  her  purported 
identification, which they could only have found in the statement of 
 
the witness Mr Khelfa, which he had disavowed by the time of trial, 
and in the evidence of Mr Harrington. Given the difficulties facing 
 
the prosecution in relation to Mr Khelfa's evidence, in our judgment 
it  must  have  been  the  evidence  of  Mr  Harrington  which  tipped  the 
balance.  The jury must have concluded that the appellant was at the 
scene,  knew  that  he  had  been  at  the  scene  when  confronted  by  Miss 
Henville and Miss Beattie two days later, and tried to lie his way 

  
 
 

37
--------
out of trouble.  However, we are now satisfied that any confidence 
that  the  appellant  had  lied  and/or  asked  Harrington  to  concoct  a 
false alibi was misplaced. 
 
77.  In our judgement the following summary encapsulates this appeal. 
 The case against the appellant depended on the visual identification 
evidence of two witnesses, neither of whom said anything in his or 
her initial statements to the police to indicate that they recognised 
 
the appellant (whom they knew) or anyone like him at the scene of the 
crime.  Miss Henville's identification of the appellant was prompted 
by  her  friend. 
Mr  Khelfa's  identification  of  the  appellant  was 
prompted by Miss Henville.  Neither was a particularly satisfactory 
witness. 
Their  various  accounts  contained  numerous  internal 
inconsistencies  and  contradictions,  and  were  contradicted  by  other 
evidence. 
Mr  Khelfa's  identification  provided  little,  if  any, 
independent  support  for  Miss  Henville's.    The  new  information  in 
 
relation  to  the  messages  from  Gary  Rees  raises  the  possibility  of 
greater collusion (in the sense of discussion) between the witnesses 
than the defence team knew at the time. It also potentially puts paid 
 
 
to  Miss  Henville's  assertion  that  from  the  outset  that  there  were 
rumours that Sam Hallam was involved.  In any event, the purported 
 
 
recognition  or  identification  of  the  appellant  took  place  in  very 
difficult circumstances.  It amounted to little more than a fleeting 
 
Thus,  even  if  the  witnesses  had  remained  rock  solid, 
glimpse. 
consistent with each other and with the evidence of other witnesses, 
 
there was scope for a case of mistaken identity. Proper independent 

 

  
 
 

38
--------
supporting evidence was essential on the facts here. 
 
78.  We now know there is the real possibility that the appellant's 
failed  alibi  was  consistent  with  faulty  recollection  and  a 
dysfunctional lifestyle, and that it was not a deliberate lie.  The 
proper support to the Crown’s case has fallen away. 
 
79.  Finally, there is the point (not spotted by anyone before these 
 
proceedings)  that  the  jury  may  not  have  appreciated  that  they  were 
free to rely upon the potentially exculpatory evidence of Bissett. 
 
80. 
In  our  judgment,  the  cumulative  effect  of  these  factors  is 
 
enough  to  undermine  the  safety  of  these  convictions.    In  those 
circumstances,  it  is  not  necessary  to  consider  further  the  alleged 
 
failures  in  disclosure  in  investigation  (which  to  our  mind  were 
nowhere near as extensive as Mr Blaxland asserted) nor the so-called 
 
positive evidence from witnesses who knew the appellant who say that 
 
he was not at the scene of the crime.  However compelling they may 
have been, we doubt they could ever have established, as Mr Blaxland 
 
asserted, positive evidence that the appellant was not at the scene, 
albeit we accept that they may have established that, like so many 
 
others, two more witnesses did not see the appellant at the incident. 
 
81.  We are indebted to the Criminal Cases Review Commission and the 
Thames  Valley  Police  for  an  extremely  thorough  investigation  and 
analysis of the evidence.  We may not agree entirely with each of the 

  
 
 

39
--------
reasons for referring the case to us, but we certainly agree with the 
reasons in relation to the alibi and to the Rees messages. 
 
82.  We conclude by expressing our sympathy to the brother and foster 
 
family of the deceased.  By all accounts he was a charming young man 
with a great deal to offer.  They have had to cope with their grief 
 
at the death of Essayas, the original investigation, the trial, a re-
opening  of  the  investigation,  and  now  these  proceedings.    We  hope 
 
that they understand that we must all do our job according to law. 
 
83.  Accordingly, the result is that the conviction is unsafe and it 
must be quashed.  The appeal is allowed. 
 
84.  Mr Hatton, I take it there is no application? 
 
MR HATTON:  There is no application. 
 
LADY JUSTICE HALLETT:  In which case there will be no retrial. 
 
MR BLAXLAND:  I have one application and that is for an extension of 
 
the  representation  order  to  cover  the  work  carried  out  by  my 
 
instructing solicitor.  He has also assisted us by attending court. 
We have a witness whom we proposed to call yesterday and he needed to 
attend. 
 
 

(The court conferred) 

  
 
 

40
--------
LADY JUSTICE HALLETT:  Yes, we are satisfied that there should be a 
 
full  representation  order  for  your  solicitor,  as  long  as  somebody 
points out that whoever physically prepared the documents, they could 
have done a better job. 
 
MR BLAXLAND:  Yes.  I could offer mitigation, but it is probably not 
 
the time or the place to do that. 
 
LADY JUSTICE HALLETT:  It probably is not, Mr Blaxland.  Thank you 
all very much.

OFFICE OF RAIL REGULATION v NETWORK RAIL INFRASTRUCTURE PLC
 
 

 

 
SENTENCING REMARKS OF
 

THE HONOURABLE MRS JUSTICE SWIFT DBE
 
 

 

WEDNESDAY 4 APRIL 2012
 
 

 

 

 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 

The defendant, Network Rail Infrastructure plc (Network Rail), pleaded guilty on 29 February 

2012 in the Lancaster Magistrates’ Court to a breach of the duty imposed on them by section 

3(1) of the Health and Safety Act 1974 to do all that was reasonably practicable to prevent the 

exposure to risk of non-employees. The charge alleged that Network Rail failed to provide 

and  implement  suitable  and  sufficient  standards,  procedures,  guidance,  training,  tools  and 

resources for the inspection and maintenance of fixed bar points. They were committed for 

sentence to this court. 

 

 

At  20.12  on  23  February  2007,  the  17.15  Virgin  Pendolino  passenger  train  from  London 

Euston  to  Glasgow  Central  was  travelling  at  95  mph  near  to  the  village  of  Grayrigg,  in 

Cumbria.  There were 109 people on board: 105 passengers, the driver and three other crew 

members.    The  train  reached  a  set  of  points,  known  as  the  Lambrigg  2B  points.    As  the 

leading coach of the train reached the points, it was thrown upwards, rotated 180° from its 

 
original direction of travel, became detached from the other eight coaches, turned over and 

rolled down the embankment.  The second coach came to rest at 90° to the direction of travel, 

 
with its front end overhanging the track and its rear end at the bottom of the embankment.
--------
Coaches 3-5 left the tracks completely and came to rest on the embankment.  Coaches 6-9, at 

the back of the train, came off the rails but remained upright. 

 

As a consequence of these events, one passenger, Mrs Margaret Masson, was killed.  She had 

been travelling in the front coach. Despite her 84 years, Mrs Masson was an active lady who 

kept house for herself and went out and about, seeing friends and enjoying life. She was an 

important and much loved member of her family. I have read a moving statement from her 
 

granddaughter, in which she describes the family’s sense of sadness at the abrupt manner of 

her grandmother’s death and the fact that it was avoidable.   

 

In addition to Mrs Masson’s tragic death, 28 other people (including the train driver) suffered 

serious injuries and 58 other passengers also sustained some injury.  This was a very serious 

incident and could easily have led to greater loss of life than in fact occurred. 

 

Following  the  accident,  a  series  of  detailed  investigations  were  conducted  into  its  cause. 
  

Those investigations revealed no evidence of any defect in the operation of the train or fault 

on the part of the train driver.  Nor was there any problem with the signalling system or on the 

section of track on the approach to the Lambrigg 2B points.  It rapidly became clear that the 

cause of the derailment had been the presence of serious defects in the points themselves.   

 

In summary, essential components of the points mechanism (namely the fixed stretcher bars 

which  regulate  the  distance  between  the  switch  rails)  were  variously  missing,  had  become 
 

detached, had broken or were held in position only loosely. The purpose of the stretcher bars 

was to ensure that, when one switch rail was closed during the operation of the points, the 

other one opened and maintained a gap (known as the ‘freewheel clearance’) for the wheel 

 

 
2
--------
flange to pass through. That gap should have been maintained at a minimum of 50mm on the 
 

open side at the rear of the points with a 1.5mm clearance fit on the closed side. The effect of 

the defects in the stretcher bars was that the two switch rails became detached from each other 

and the freewheel clearance was reduced to between 10 and 20mm. Consequently, when the 

train entered the points, its wheels were guided into a narrowing gap between the rail tracks. 
  

The train wheels were mounted on an axle and could not adapt to the narrowing gap. Instead, 

they climbed over the rails and the derailment occurred. 

 

The stretcher bars should have been held in position by threaded bolts, each fitted with a nut 

and a single coil spring washer. Metallurgical analysis showed that, over time, the retaining 

nuts had unwound from the bolts.  Some of the nuts had become detached altogether; others 

had loosened significantly.  Three factors in particular are believed to have contributed to this 

 
process.  First, plain wrenches or spanners – rather than torque wrenches – had been used to 

tighten nuts manually.  This caused variation of bolt tension with resultant variation in bolt 

preloading and clamping forces, leading to joint slippage.  If torque wrenches had been used, 

it would have been possible to ensure that nuts were tightened to the required torque. Second, 

there had been repeated unlubricated tightening of nuts, which had led to damage to bearing 

 
surfaces, increasing friction and thereby reducing bolt preload.  Third, the washers used had 

been ineffective in preventing the nuts from loosening once the bolt tension was lost.    

 

 

 
The deterioration in the condition of the Lambrigg 2B points and their ultimate failure arose 

 
as a result of serious and multiple deficiencies in the systems of inspection and maintenance 

operated by Network Rail. 

 

 

 
3
--------
From 1994, Railtrack PLC (Railtrack) owned and operated the mainline railway infrastructure 

and had overall responsibility for its maintenance.  Under Railtrack, the work of maintaining 

the railways was carried out by contractors employed by them.  

 

On 10 May 2002, at a time when Railtrack were still responsible for the railway infrastructure, 

a train was derailed on the approach to Potters Bar railway station. Seven people were killed 

as result of that accident and many more were injured.  Inadequate maintenance of a set of 
 

points, in particular the loose fastening of an adjustable (not a fixed) stretcher bar, led to the 

failure of the points and derailment of the train.  Subsequent inspection of other sections of 

the East Coast Mainline after the Potters Bar derailment revealed that similar stretcher bars 
 

were also in an unsatisfactory state.  

 

At the time of the Potters Bar derailment, there were in place no specific written guidelines, 
 

instructions  or  standards  for  the  installation,  inspection  and  maintenance  of  adjustable 
 

stretcher bars.  The inadequate system of inspection   and maintenance that was in place was 

 

not  being  complied  with.  Maintenance  staff  had  not  been  properly  trained  in  what  was 

required. 

 

In  late  2002,  Network  Rail  succeeded  Railtrack  as  operator  of  the  mainline  railway 

 
infrastructure.  From 2004, Network Rail ceased to use contractors to maintain the railways. 

Instead, they undertook the work of maintenance in-house.  From that time, Network Rail was 

responsible  for  setting  standards  and  procedures  for  the  installation,  inspection  and 

maintenance of the railways. They were also responsible for actually undertaking that work. 

 
They were well aware of the systemic deficiencies that had caused the Potters Bar derailment 

and the need for the proper maintenance of points.    

 

 
4
--------
Standards and procedures relating to the inspection and maintenance of points were laid down 

by  Network  Rail  and  were  set  out  in  a  number  of  documents  issued  to  members  of  staff 

responsible  for  those  functions.  The  documents  specified  the  frequency  and  content  of  the 

inspections  to  be  carried  out,  the  level  of  employee  who  should  undertake  each  type  of 

inspection, the types of defect that required immediate attention and the records to be made 
 

following each inspection. 

 

Investigations conducted since the Grayrigg derailment have revealed that the inspection and 

maintenance  system  in  operation  on  the  ground  did  not  comply  with  the  standards  and 

guidance  set  out  in  the  relevant  documents.  Mandatory  elements  of  inspections  (such  as 

 
measuring  the  freewheel  clearance  and  the  track  gauge)  were  omitted  and  records  of 

 
inspections were not rigorously or accurately kept with the result that missed or incomplete 

 
inspections went undetected. There was no effective audit to ensure that inspections had been 

carried out. 

 

On 7 January 2007, just over six weeks before the Grayrigg derailment, a routine inspection 

revealed that some of the nuts and bolts holding one of the stretcher bars at the Lambrigg 2B 

points  had  worked  loose.  The  matter  was  reported  and  the  nuts  and  bolts  were  tightened 

 
using a plain spanner, not a torque wrench.  There was no subsequent investigation into the 

cause of the loosening, despite the fact that Network Rail’s standards and procedures stated 

that  such  an  inspection  was  mandatory.  The  points  should  have  been  subject  to  a  routine 

inspection five days before the derailment. This was not carried out. The fact that the points 

 
had not been inspected on that occasion was not recorded as it should have been, as a result of 

 

 
5
--------
which the omission went unnoticed. The points should have been inspected weekly. At the 

time of the derailment, they had not been inspected for twelve days.  

 

Those responsible for investigating the cause of the Grayrigg derailment concluded that lack 
 

of  training  and  supervision  played  a  large  part  in  the  events  preceding  the  derailment. 

Network Rail’s standards and procedures required that personnel responsible for carrying out 

inspections  should  have  undergone  appropriate  training  and  should  hold  a  certificate  of 

competency.    However,  many  of  those  responsible  for  inspection  and  maintenance  work  - 

even those in supervisory positions - had not been trained in the up to date procedures; few 
 

had current certificates of competency. Network Rail’s standards and procedures also required 
 

track patrolling diagrams to be created in order to identify precisely the sections of track to be 
 

covered  in  each  inspection  and  the  route  to  be  taken  by  each  patrol.    No  track  patrolling 
 

 

diagrams were available for the stretch of railway line which included the Lambrigg 2B points.  

 
As a result, members of staff had to organise their own inspection routes and there was an 

obvious risk that defects in the infrastructure would be missed. 

 

 
The deficiencies in the system were exacerbated by the effect of enhanced permitted speeds 

 
(EPS),  together  with  changes  to  train  timetables  on  the  West  Coast  mainline  which  were 

 
effected in December 2005 at a time when improvements to the line were being carried out. 

 
The changes, which were originally intended to be a temporary measure, were still in force in 

2007. They meant that, instead of carrying out routine inspections of the railways mid-week, 

those  inspections  had  to  be  conducted  early  on  Sunday  mornings,  when  the  available 

 
manpower  was  limited.  In  winter,  the  hours  of  daylight  during  which  inspections  could  be 

conducted  were  restricted  to  as  little  as  2½-3  hours.  The  curtailment  of  time  within  which 

inspections could be carried out was known to cause difficulties and had been the subject of 

 

 
6
--------
much discussion.  The system remained unchanged as at February 2007.  Since the Grayrigg 

derailment, the distance to be covered in individual patrols has been reduced so as to enable 

 
the patrols to fit more easily into the time available. 

 

The investigations also revealed deficiencies in the written standards and procedures provided 

by  Network  Rail.  These  documents  required  the  cause  of  any  defect  that  was  found  on 

inspection  to  be  investigated,  but  did  not  specify  who  was  to  be  responsible  for  the 

investigation  with  the  result  that,  after  the  loosened  nuts  were  found  on  7  January,  no 

investigation took place. Although one set of procedures required that the clearance fit should 

be  set,  after  2006  it  did  not  explicitly  state  the  required  setting  of  1.5mm.  The  documents 

failed  to  require  the  use  of  torque  wrenches  to  tighten  nuts.  The  reference  to  the  required 

torque values had been removed from the body of one of the main documents and appeared 

only in a section where it was less prominent. The documents did not specify that loose or 

worn  nuts  should  not  be  re-tightened,  but  should  instead  be  replaced  by  new  nuts.    The 

 

standard form used as a prompt for, and record of, certain inspections was out of date and 

unsuitable to be employed as a checklist, a fact which was not understood by those using it.   

 

Following the Grayrigg derailment, 700 sets of points elsewhere on the railway network were 

inspected. No other set of points had stretcher bars missing. However, 6% showed defects in 

the stretcher bar assembly and 13% had loose bolts.    

 

The systemic deficiencies which came to light after the Grayrigg derailment had persisted for 

some  considerable  time,  at  least  since  the  EPS  and  timetable  changes  were  introduced  in 

December 2005, with corresponding reduction in access to the track for inspection purposes. 

 

 
7
--------
That  is  a  period  of  14  months.  The  defects  in  the  Lambrigg  2B  points  had  arisen  and 

deteriorated over a shorter period, no more than a few weeks.    

 

Network Rail have submitted a basis of plea in which they admit the failings I have described.    

They seek to put those failings into context.  They say that fixed stretcher bar points of the 

same design as the Lambrigg 2B points had been in use at thousands of locations across the 

railway network over five decades and had performed successfully without repeated failures. 
  

They  suggest  that  a  perception  may  have  grown  up  amongst  their  workforce  that  the  risks 

associated  with  non-adjustable  stretcher  bars  of  this  type  were  low.  They  suggest  that  this 

perception - mistaken as it turned out - adversely affected the operation on the ground of the 
 

specified procedures for inspection, reporting of faults and maintenance. They emphasise that 

detailed  standards  and  procedures  for  the  inspection  and  maintenance  of  points  had  been 

 
produced  and  were  in  force  at  the  time  of  the  Grayrigg  derailment.  Had  the  specified 

procedures been complied with, the derailment could have been avoided.   

 

Network  Rail  acknowledge  that  the  introduction  of  EPS  after  2005  had  the  undesirable 

consequence that the number of daylight hours available for routine inspections was restricted, 

particularly  in  winter.  They  say  that,  nevertheless,  there  was  sufficient  time  to  carry  out 

inspections in accordance with the prescribed standards and procedures. The time could be 

extended if necessary. They point out that experts have subsequently expressed the view that 

the processes adopted when EPS was introduced were “appropriate”. I am satisfied however 

 
that the regime of Sunday morning inspections conducted within a limited time frame must 

have  placed  an  additional  pressure  on  local  inspection  teams  and  may  well  have  had  an 

adverse effect on the thoroughness of some of the inspections carried out.   

 

 

 
8
--------
The defendant in these proceedings is a limited company and the only penalty which it is open 

to me to impose is a fine. When setting the amount of that fine, I am required by law to take 

into  account  “the  circumstances  of  the  case  including,  among  other  things,  the  financial 
 

circumstances of the offender …”   

 

Plainly, Network Rail has access to large funds and will be able to meet any financial penalty 

I may impose. However, that is not the only consideration. Network Rail’s parent company is 

a private sector “not for dividend” company.  Any profit made by Network Rail is re-invested 

in the network. The majority of Network Rail’s income comes from the public sector, either 
 

directly by way of government grants or indirectly through charges made to train operating 

companies which are in turn funded by train fares. Consequently, any fine which I impose 

 
will be paid from an income which is substantially derived from public funds and is likely to 

have the effect of reducing Network Rail’s ability to generate profits which can be re-invested 

 
in the railway network, including maintenance and safety.  It seems to me that I must take this 

factor into account when I come to consider the level of fine which it is appropriate for me to 

 

impose. 

 

The  Sentencing  Guidelines  Council  has  issued  Guidelines  on  the  proper  approach  to 

sentencing for Health & Safety offences causing death.  Those Guidelines came into force in 

 

February 2010 and I am required to have regard to them before passing sentence in this case. 

The  Guidelines  provide  that  I  should  assess  the  seriousness  of  the  offence  by  asking  four 

questions. 

 

Firstly,  I  must  ask  how  foreseeable  it  was  that  serious  injury  would  result  from  Network 

Rail’s breach of duty. There can be no doubt that the defective condition of the Lambrigg 2B 

 

 
9
--------
points on 23 February 2007, which was caused by the failures I have identified, gave rise to 

an obvious and wholly foreseeable risk of serious injury or death to members of the public 

and staff travelling on trains on this section of the track.     

 

Secondly, I must ask how far short of the necessary standard Network Rail fell. This was not 
 

a case of a single systemic failure or an error by one or two individuals. There were multiple 
 

failures, both individual and systemic, which in combination led to the derailment. There were 

significant omissions in the written standards and procedures that were in force. There was a 

failure  to  comply  with  the  standards  and  procedures  which  were  prescribed.  It  is  no  good 

having written standards and procedures in place if they are not carried out on the ground and 

if those employees carrying out the relevant work are not adequately trained and supervised. 

That was the case here.  The critical importance of points and their potential for failure should 

 
have  been  evident  after  the  Potters  Bar  derailment.  The  inspections  carried  out  after  that 

accident had shown that the condition of the points at Potters Bar was not an isolated problem. 

I accept that the nature of the failure at Grayrigg was different from that at Potters Bar. But 

many of the underlying systemic failures – lack of adequate standards and procedures, non­

 
compliance with systems that were in place and failure properly to train maintenance staff – 

were the same.  The need to investigate the cause of defects found in the course of inspections 

 
had  been  appreciated  after  the  Potters  Bar  derailment.  It  had  been  prescribed  in  written 

standards. Yet no guidance had been given as to how this should be achieved. Given all these 

 
circumstances, I consider that Network Rail fell very far short of the standards required of a 

company with responsibility for the maintenance of railway tracks and the safety of rail users 

and railway staff. 

 

 

 
10
--------
The third question I must ask is how extensive the breach was across Railtrack’s sphere of 

operations. The evidence is that the relevant failures extended over a considerable period of 

time and that they were by no means confined to the Lambrigg 2B points alone. Defects – 

albeit  not  of  the  same  extent  –  were  found  in  many  other  sets  of  points  elsewhere  on  the 

railway network. 

 

Finally, I must ask how far up the organisation did the breach of duty go.  There is no doubt 

that there were very serious failings by local staff responsible for the day to day inspection 

and maintenance of the relevant section of track and by those responsible for managing and 

supervising  those  staff.  However,  their  task  was  made  far  more  difficult  by  the  various 

omissions in the documents containing the standards and procedures and by the restrictions 

imposed as a result of the introduction of the EPS. Responsibility for those matters lay with 

those at senior management level within Network Rail.      

 

Having considered those four questions, I conclude that the offence carries a high degree of 
 

seriousness.  

 

The  Guidelines  identify  a  number  of  factors  which,  if  present,  are  likely  to  aggravate  the 

offence.  The  relevant  aggravating  factors  in  this  case  (over  and  above  those  which  I  have 

already taken into account) are, first, the fact that very grave personal injuries were caused to 

some people, in addition to Mrs Masson’s sad death, and, second, the fact that Network Rail 

has previous convictions, of which the most relevant relates to the Potters Bar derailment. I 

accept that the circumstances of many of the other convictions are different from those in the 

present  case.  Nevertheless,  I  cannot  overlook  the  fact  that  there  have  been  a  significant 

 

 
11
--------
number  of  occasions  when  Network  Rail  have  breached  their  duty  of  care  in  one  way  or 

another. 

    

The Guidelines also specify factors which are likely, if present, to afford mitigation. Relevant 
 

for  the  purposes  of  this  case  is,  first,  Network  Rail’s  prompt  acceptance  of  responsibility. 
 

Network  Rail  accepted  responsibility  for  the  Grayrigg  derailment  very  promptly,  in  a 

statement issued by their then Chief Executive issued only three days after the derailment and 

apologising  unreservedly  for  the  failure  of  the  infrastructure.  They  pleaded  guilty  to  the 

offence  charged  at  the  earliest  opportunity.    They  have  settled  the  claims  made  by  those 
 

injured in the derailment without the necessity for recourse to civil claims.  

 

 

 

The second relevant factor is the fact that, since the Grayrigg derailment. Network Rail has 
 

co-operated fully with the investigations that have been carried out by various bodies.  

 

The  third  relevant  factor  is  the  efforts  made  by  Network  Rail  to  remedy  the  defects  that 
 

caused  the  derailment.  I  am  satisfied  that,  since  the  Grayrigg  derailment  Network  Rail  has 

taken  active  steps  to  remedy  the  failures  that  caused  it.  I  have  already  mentioned  the 

inspections that were undertaken following the derailment. The findings of those inspections 

informed the actions that Network Rail took subsequently to improve the safety of points. The 

design of points has been improved by the use of ‘hardlock’ nuts and higher manufacturing 

specifications for stretcher bars and brackets. A new design of stretcher bar is currently being 

tested. New standards and procedures documents have been produced which are intended to 

clarify  the  responsibilities  and  requirements  for  the  inspection  and  maintenance  of  fixed 

stretcher bar assemblies. I am told that measures have been taken to improve record keeping, 

staff training and competency assessments. There are plans for trainborne video inspection of 

 

 
12
--------
switches and crossings and the development of trainborne pattern recognition technology. All 
 

these  measures,  if  implemented  properly  and  consistently,  should  have  the  effect  of 

preventing this type of accident from happening again.    

 

I note that, since the Grayrigg derailment, the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) has found it 

necessary  to  issue  a  number  of  Improvement  Notices  against  Network  Rail  because  of 
 

concerns that, at certain specific locations, their prescribed standards and procedures for track 

inspection  patrols  were  not  being  followed  on  the  ground.  I  am  told  also  that  the  ORR  is 
 

continuing  to  monitor  progress  on  the  implementation  of  some  of  the  improvements  that 
 

Network Rail is making. They are not satisfied that enough has yet been done. These facts 

 
illustrate  the  importance  of  maintaining  the  efforts  made  over  the  last  few  years  if  railway 

safety standards are to undergo a lasting improvement.         

 

There is evidence that Network Rail’s safety performance has improved in the five years since 

the Grayrigg derailment. The accident frequency rate for Network Rail’s workforce is now the 

lowest it has ever been. In the last six years, the unfortunate Mrs Masson has been the only 

passenger  to  lose  her  life  in  a  train  accident.  There  have  been  no  passenger  or  workforce 

fatalities  in  train  accidents  during  the  period  from  2008  to  the  present  time.  These 

 
improvements, if maintained, afford reason to hope that, in the future, rail passengers will be 

able to have confidence that those responsible for rail safety are properly carrying out their 

responsibilities. 

 

In  addition  to  the  Guidelines,  the  parties  have  drawn  my  attention  to  a  number  of  cases, 

including the sentencing remarks of His Honour Judge Bright QC following Network Rail’s 

plea of guilty to an offence arising out of the Potters Bar derailment. The fine imposed in that 

 

 
13
--------
case was one of £3 million. I have had regard to the level of fine imposed in that and the other 

cases and to the principles to be derived from them.  However, each case is dependent on its 

 

own facts and circumstances.  

 

I am acutely conscious that no fine, however large, can put a value on the life lost as a result 

of the Grayrigg derailment or the pain and suffering of those who were injured on that day. 

 

That is not its purpose. The fine is imposed in order to mark the seriousness of the offence 

and to emphasise the fact that those who bear the responsibility for ensuring the safety of the 
 

public must exercise proper care. Over 1.32 billion passenger journeys are made every year 

on Britain’s railways and the importance of   implementing safe and adequate systems for the 

inspection  and  maintenance  of  the  infrastructure  is  paramount,  in  order  to  ensure  that 

accidents like the ones at Potters Bar and Grayrigg do not occur again.    

 

Having  regard  to  all  the  circumstances  of  the  case  and  to  the  aggravating  and  mitigating 
 

circumstances to which I have referred, I consider the appropriate fine if Network Rail had 

been convicted after trial would have been one of £6 million.  However, Network Rail are 

 
entitled  by  law  to  credit  for  their  guilty  plea  made  at  the  earliest  opportunity  and    I  am 

therefore  required  to  discount  the  fine  by  one  third.    The  fine  will  therefore  be  one  of  £4 

million. 

 

 
The  ORR  have  applied  for  their  costs.    The  cost  to  the  taxpayer  of  the  investigation  and 

prosecution has been agreed at £118,037.  I order that Network Rail should pay those costs in 

full. The fine and costs totalling £4,118,037 must be paid within 28 days.

Sentencing Remarks of Mr. Justice Roderick Evans
R
_v_
lftikhar Ahmed
and
Farzana Ah med
NOTE: there is an 5.39 Order restricting reporting details relating to the youngest child, identified in
these remarks as X.
The jury has found you both guilty of the murder of your daughter Shafilea. She was 17 years of
age when you killed her. What was it that brought you two — her parents, the people who had
given her life —to the point of killing her?
You, lftikhar Ahmed, came to the United Kingdom when you were 10 years of age and you are fully
familiar with western culture. Indeed, you married a Danish woman and had a son by her and
lived, for some time, in Denmark. Then, in 1985, you returned to Pakistan and, while you were
there, you married Farzana Ahmed, your first cousin. She lived in your home village in rural
Pakistan. She had no experience of western culture but in 1986 you both came to England and
settled here. You have lived here for the last 25 years. When you arrived here you, Farzana
Ahmed, were pregnant with Shafilea. In due course, you had four other children, three daughters,
Alesha, Mevish and X and a son, Junyad.
You chose to bring up your family in Warrington but, although you lived in Warrington, your social
and cultural attitudes were those of rural Pakistan and it was those which you imposed upon your
children.
Shafilea was a determined, able and ambitious girl who wanted to live a life which was normal in
the country and in the town in which you had chosen to live and bring up your children. However,
you could not tolerate the life that Shafilea wanted to live. You wanted your family to live in
Pakistan in Warrington. Although she went to local schools, you objected to her socialising with
girls from what has been referred to as ”the white community"". You objected to her wearing
western clothes and you objected to her having contact with boys.
1
--------
She was being squeezed between two cultures, the culture and way of life that she saw around
her and wanted to embrace and the culture and way of life you wanted to impose upon her. A
desire that she understood and appreciated the cultural heritage from which she came is perfectly
understandable but an expectation that she live in a sealed cultural environment separate from
the culture of the country in which she lived was unrealistic, destructive and cruel. The conflict
between you and her increased in the last year of her life and you tried to impose your cultural
values and attitudes on her by intimidation, bullying and the use of physical violence. She tried to
escape and she was determined to do so because she knew what lay in store for her at your hands
— being taken to Pakistan to be ”sorted out"" i.e. having her westernised ideas removed — and to be
married off.
She ran away in February 2003 but you recaptured her, dragged her off the street and forced her
into your car and, a week later, she was drugged and taken to Pakistan. I have no doubt that your
intention was that she should remain in Pakistan and be married there. There came a time in
Pakistan when she realised what her immediate future was going to be; she self-harmed by
drinking bleach in order to frustrate your plans. She seriously injured herself and her condition
deteriorated to such an extent after she had been left in Pakistan that she was no longer wanted
as a bride. She was brought back to the United Kingdom where she received prolonged hospital
treatment. On her discharge from hospital, even in her weakened condition, she continued to
want freedom and to live the life she wanted for herself.
On the evening of 11th September 2003, you berated her for her behaviour and, in temper and
frustration, you two suffocated her. It was you, Farzana Ahmed, who said to your husband ”finish
it here"". While I accept that there was no pre-existing plan to kill Shafilea that night, that remark
together with the evidence relating to whether or not Shafilea survived the drinking of bleach
drives me to the conclusion that you two had previously discussed the way that you might
ultimately resolve the problem which Shafilea presented for you.
Your problem was that, in what you referred to as your ”community”, Shafilea's conduct was
bringing shame upon you and your concern about being shamed in your community was greater
than your love of you child. In order to rid yourselves of that problem, you killed Shafilea by
suffocating her in the presence of your other four children.
I express no concluded view on whether Junyad played any part in the killing of his sister but I
have no doubt that, as the result of the distorted upbringing and values to which you subjected
him, he told his surviving sisters, within minutes of them seeing Shafilea murdered by you, that
Shafilea deserved it. Thereafter, you got rid of her body by dumping it or having it dumped in
undergrowth on a riverbank in Cumbria and you told your children what to tell anybody who
asked about the disappearance of Shafilea.
You killed one daughter, but you have blighted the lives of your remaining children. Alesha
escaped but she is unlikely to be able to avoid the legacy of her upbringing. Mevish, after a period
of trying to live independently, was recaptured and brought home and has since become
compliant with your wishes. She came to court and was placed in the sad position of having to
deny her own words in order to try to help the parents whom she, and no doubt all your surviving
children, still care for. X was seven when she saw Shafilea killed and it is difficult to say what
effect that has had upon her or will have upon her in the future. However, there is no difficulty in
seeing the life which would have lain ahead of her, had she returned to live with you. That future
2
--------
is graphically set out in the Social Services notes of contact sessions between you and her in which
you are recorded making clear your views of X's attitudes and what you expected in the future.

As to Junyad, he remains supportive, especially of you Iftikhar Ahmed. Whether that is simply out
of filial affection or the result of the warped values you instilled in him, is impossible to tell.

There is only one sentence that I can impose upon you and that is a sentence of imprisonment for
life.

However, I have to set the minimum period that you must spend in custody before you can be
considered for parole. That has to be done in accordance with the sentencing regime which
applied at the time you murdered Shafilea, that is, that which applied after 31St May 2002 and
before 18th December 2003.

My first task is to identify the starting point for setting the minimum term. In my judgment, your
culpability can, because of the circumstances of the murder, properly be described as
exceptionally high and, therefore, I take the higher starting point.

I then have to consider the aggravating and mitigating features of the case to adjust that starting
point appropriately ensuring, as I do, that the features which led me to adopt the higher starting
point, are not considered again as aggravating features, in a way which would unfairly inflate the
minimum term I set.

The first point to note is, of course, that your intention was to kill Shafilea. That is not an
aggravating feature but it means that there can be no mitigation which a lesser intent would
attract.

Mitigating Features

I accept, subject to what I have said, that there was no pre-existing plan to kill Shafilea that night.
The only other mitigating feature I can identify is the absence of previous convictions and that,
while not wholly irrelevant, can in the circumstances of this case, have but little influence on the
term I have to set.

Aggravating Features

I identify the following aggravating features in this case:

1. You were the people to whom Shafilea should have been able to look for protection and
kindness. Your treatment of her and your killing her was as fundamental a breach of trust
as can be imagined.

2. You acted together as a team to kill her.

3. In the year before you killed Shafilea, you subjected her to repeated violence; you
abducted her from the street on 10th February, you drugged her to take her to Pakistan
and you tried to arrange a marriage for her which was against her will.

3
--------
4. Shafilea was in a vulnerable condition when you killed her. She was still weak from the
effects of the ingestion of bleach which she had taken to try to avoid what you had
planned for her in Pakistan.

5. A truly horrifying feature of this case is that you killed Shafilea in the presence of your
otherfour children.

6. The killing was motivated by the cultural issues to which I have already referred.

7. After the killing, you concealed her body.

8. After the killing, not only did you lie and mislead people to cover up what you did,
including lying on oath before the Coroner, but you also made your surviving children put
forward an account which was intended to hide what you had done.

I have considered the impact of Paragraph 10 of Schedule 22 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003.
There is no basis upon which I should differentiate between you. The minimum term which in my
judgment adequately reflects the seriousness of this case in respect of each of you, is 25 years.
You will not be eligible to be considered for parole until you have served those 25 years in prison.
When you have done so, you will not be released automatically. You will be released only when
the Parole Board is satisfied that you no longer present a danger.
The sentence, therefore, in respect of each of you is life imprisonment with a minimum term of 25
years from which will be deducted the number of days which you have served in custody during
this case. In the case of each of you, I am told that you have been in custody for 66 days. If that
figure proves inaccurate, it will be amended administratively.

Mr Justice Hooper:

The two defendants are charged with manslaughter (Counts ] and 2) and misconduct in
public ofﬁce (Count 3) arising out of the events at Hillsborough Stadium on the 15Th April
1989. The prosecution is what is commonly known as a private prosecution. The decision to
bring the proceedings in 1998 was made by the Hillsborough Family Support Group
(“IIFSG”) as a whole (8/30), That group is unincorporated and consists of some 86 of the
bereaved families. Ann Adlington has been seconded by Liverpool City Council to act as the
solicitor for the Group and she laid the informations.

David. Duckenﬁeld (“Duckenﬁeld”) was a chief superintendent in charge 01' the policing on
that day. Bernard Murray (“Murray”), a superintendent, was the ofﬁcer with speciﬁc
responsibility for the control room. Following a decision by Duckenﬁeld to order the opening
of the gates, a decision not criticised by the prosecution, 96 people who were watching the
game in pens 3 and 4 of the West Terraces died from traumatic asphyxiation. Duckenﬁcld
also faces a charge of misconduct arising from an admitted lie told by him at the time to the
effect that the gates had been forced open by the Liverpool fans. (Count 5) Count 4 charged
him with perverting the course of justice, a charge which he no longer faces following
intervention by the Attorney-General who entered a “nolle prosequi”.

In this ruling I shall concentrate on Counts l, 2 and 3.

It is the prosecution’s case that the two defendants are guilty of manslaughter because they
failed to prevent a crush in pcns 3 and 4 of the West Terraces “by failing between 2.40 and
3.06 p.111. to procure the diversion of spectators entering the ground from the entrance to the
pen.” In argument Mr Jones QC for the prosecution said that his case was that police oﬂicers
should have been stationed in front of the tunnel leading to the pen to prevent access. It
appears, at this stage, to be the defence case that neither of the ofﬁcers, in the situation in
which they found themselves, thought about closing off the tunnel or foresaw the risk of
serious injury in the pen if they did not do so. The prosecution submit that they ought to have
done. This is likely to he the most important issue in the case. There may well be a further
issue: if the risk had been foreseen, would it have been possible or practicable to have closed
the tunnel.

It was the worst stadium disaster in British football history and has left the parents and loved
ones of those who died not only with an enduring grief but also with a deep seated and
obviously genuine grievance that those thought responsible have not been prosecuted nor

indeed even disciplined. They have campaigned long and hard for what they see as justice
and have attracted wide-spread support. Amongst other things of which they have
complained arc the lack of any apology, the conduct of the inquest, the disparity between the
damages awarded to the families and to the police ofﬁcers and a cover—up amounting to a
conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, particularly on the part of the South Yorkshire
Police and their then legal advisers.
it. is submitted that the proceedings should now be stayed on the following grounds:

1. The prosecution is a breach of the defendants’ rights to a fair trial under Article 6(1)}

of the European Convention on Human Rights.
2. The prosecution is so oppressive to these defendants, so unfair and so wrong that it
should not be allowed to continue.

Taylor Inquiry ﬁrst stage. 174 oral witnesses called, including Duekenﬁeld and Murray who
were not personally advised by ].J Taylor of their right not to answer questions which might
incriminate them because L] Taylor and Mr Andrew Collins QC Counsel to the Inquiry took
the view that manslaughter charges were not a realistic possibility (see my earlier ruling on
December 22, 1999). Both Collins J as 11c now is and Mr William Woodward QC gave
evidence before me that there were at this stage murmurings of private prosecutions.

i’ublication of Taylor Interim report.
1 set out some of the ﬁndings of the Report. In obtaining her application for the summonses
Ann Adlington relied upon a document prepared by Mr Jones (81’ 13A) in which it was stated
that the facts set out in chapters 15, 9-11 and 16 of the Taylor Report “form the basis of the
allegations against the two potential defendants.”
“Chapter I
Police Communications
49. The nerve centre for police control is the control room or box situated at the
south—west corner of the ground between the south stand and pen 1 of the west
terracing. The box is elevated and reached by a number of steps. It has windows
commanding views across the pitch and straight along the line of the west perimeter
fence. The box is very small and has seats for only three ofﬁcers. Superintendent
Murray was in control of it and was advisor to Mr Duekenﬁeld as he had been to Mr
Mole the year before. Next to him sat Sergeant Goddard who operated the radios.
The third seat was for Police Constable Ryan who operated the telephone and public
address systems. At the back of the box stood Police Constable Biehard who was in
control of the police closed circuit television system operated by a row of consoles on
a bench in front of him and behind the three seated ofﬁcers.
Chapter 3
‘Open the Gates’
70. The largest entry, however, was through gate C. In the ﬁve minutes it was open
about 2,000 fans passed through it steadily at a fast walk. Some may have had tickets
for the stands. No doubt some had no tickets at all. The majority had tickets for the
terraces. Of these, some found their way either right to pens l and 2 or left through
the dividing wall to 6 and 7. But a large proportion headed straight for the tunnel in
front of them.

control room for information. Mr Duckenﬁeld told them he thought there were
fatalities and the game was likely to be abandoned. He also said a gate had been
forced and there had been an inrush of Liverpool supporters. He pointed to one of the
television screens focused on gate C by the Leppings Lane turnstiles and said “'lhat’s
the gate that’s been forced: there’s been an inrush”. Inevitably Mr Kelly was
interviewed a little later live on television. He spoke of the two stories concerning the
gate — the fans’ account that the police had opened it, the police assertion that the fans
had forced their way in.
The Dead and the Injured
108. Of the 95 who died the evidence suggests that at least 16 and probably 21 came
through gate C aﬁer it opened at 2.52 p.111. That is established by the statements of
relatives and friends who came through with them but survived.
111. Although the great majority of those who died were in pen 3 at least ﬁve were in
pen 4. Most deaths occurred at the front of the pens but there were a few fatalities
ﬁuther back.
Part 11
Why did it happen?
The Archbishop of York, Dr John Hahgood, preaching at the Hillsborough Memorial
Service on 23 April 1989 said:
“Events of the magnitude of Hillsborough don’t usually happen just for one
single reason, nor is it usually possible to pin the blame on one single
scapegoat Disasters happen because a whole series of mistakes,
misj udgments and mischauccs happen to come together in a deadly
combination.”
115. This disaster was the worst in the history of British football. It happened
because pcns 3 and 4 became grossly overcrowded. They were uncomfortably
overcrowded by 2.50 pm. at least to a degree which required that they should be
closed to further arrivals. Even the numbers coming through the turnstiles in the last
10 minutes would have increased the pressure beyond danger point and there would
have been injuries if not fatalities. As it was the inﬂux through gate C aﬁer 2.52 pm.
so increased the pressure in the two pens as to cause fatal crushing.
Chapter 9
Summary
183. Although the police had accepted defucto responsibility for monitoring the pens
their policy on the day was to leave fans to “ﬁnd their own level"" and to concentrate
their own attention on possible disorder. Whilst in theory the police would intervene
if a pen became “ﬁill” in practice they permitted the test of fullness to be what the fans
would tolerate.
184. By 2.52 p.m. when gate C was opened pens 3 and 4 were over-full even by this
test. Many were uncomfortable. To allow any more into those pens was likely to

Chapter 10
Summary
228. The layout of the turnstiles and the number they were required to serve leﬁ no
margin of safety against an uneven ﬂow of fans. Because police strategy in advance
and on the day did not cater for it the arrival of a large number of supponers between
2.30 pm. and 2.40 pm. created an unmanageable crush. The presence of a substantial
minority of fans who had drunk too much aggravated that problem. Having lost
control and rejected the option of postponing kick-off the police were faced with a
serious danger of deaths or injuries. They were left therefore with no alternative but
to open the gates. Superintendent Marshall was right at that stage to ask for it and Mr
Duekenﬁeld was right to agree. But the possible effects of so dramatic a step required
other action.
Chapter 11
The Blunder on opening the gates
229. The decision to order the opening of the gates was not accompanied or followed
by any other order to deal with the consequences. When gate C was opened a steady
stream of about 2,000 fans poured through it over some ﬁve minutes. Clearly they
were going to go into the ground somewhere and unless they were diverted their
likeliest route was through the tunnel for reasons already given. No warning was
issued from the control room that the gate was to be opened. Serials on the concourse
were not alerted. Neither the Club control room not the Chief Steward at the
Leppings Lane end was warned. Not even Mr Greenwood, the Ground Commander,
was informed. From 2.47 pm. when Mr Marshall made his ﬁrst request until 2.52
pm. when Mr Duckenﬁeld acceded to it there were ﬁve minutes in which orders
could have been given as to how the inﬂux was to be absorbed. It was not done. in
evidence Mr Duckenﬁeld began by saying that no oﬁ‘icer made any wrong decision
but he later conceded he had erred in this regard. He said he did not consider where
the people would go when the gate opened. Even after it opened, when he could see
the inﬂux on the television screen, no order was given to steer the fans to the wing
pens. Mr Duckenfield said it did not cross his mind to detail ofﬁcers on the concourse
to shut off the tunnel. Those ofﬁcers could not have known from their position how
full pens 3 and 4 were. That was a matter for the control room to monitor from its
own observations and using intelligence from around the ground,
230. Since pens 3 and 4 were full by 2.50 p.1n. the tunnel should have been closed off
whether gate C was to be opened or not. The exercise was a simple one and had been
carried out in 1988. All that was necessary was for a few ofﬁcers to act as a cordon at
the entrance to the tunnel and divert fans elsewhere. Unfortunately the 1988 closure
seems to have been unknown to the senior otlieers on duty at the time. It did not
ﬁgure in the debrieﬁng notes. It therefore had no inﬂuence on the planning for 1989.
231. Planning apart, however, it should have been clear in the control room where
there was a view of the pens and of the crowd at the turnstiles that the tunnel had to be
closed. If orders had been given to that effect when gate C was opened the fans could

have been directed to the empty areas of the wings mid this disaster could still have
been avoided. Failure to give that order was a blunder of the ﬁrst magnitude.
232. Signiﬁcantly, when permiSsion was given to open gate A, Mr Duckenﬁeld did
order serials to go to that part of the concourse to monitor the inﬂux towards the north
stand. He did this because he feared that if fans went to the north stand without
tickets. they would not get seats and there being no perimeter fences at the north side,
they might invade the pitch. This illustrates again the preoccupation with avoiding
pitch invasion as against safety and the risks of overcrowding. Because those entering
through gate C could not get onto the pitch it was not thought necessary to alert
officers to monitor them. The possibility of overcrowding simply was not considered.
Chapter 16
Brief summary of causes
265. The immediate cause of the gross overcrowding and hence the disaster was the
failure when gate C was opened to cut off access to the central pens which were
already overfull.
266, They were already overfuil because no safe maximum capacities had been laid
down, no attempt was made to control entry to individual pens numerically and there
was no effective visual monitoring of crowd density.
Chapter 18
Policing on the Day
280. By contrast. with some notable exceptions, the senior officers in command were
defensive and evasive witnesses, Their feelings of grief and sorrow were obvious and
genuine. No doubt those feelings were intensiﬁed by the knowledge that such a
disaster had occurred under their management. But, neither their handling of
problems on the day nor their aceount of it in evidence showed the qualities of
leadership to be expected of their rank.
281. Mr Duckenﬁeld leant heavily on Mr Murray’s experience. Between them they
misjudged the build-up at the turnstiles and did little about it until they received Mr
Marshall’s request to open the gate. They did not, for example, check the tumstile
ﬁgures available from Club control or check with Tango units as to the numbers still
to come. They did not alert Mr Greenwood to the situation at the fringe of his area of
command. They gave no instructions as to the management of the crowd at Leppings
Lane. lnﬂexibly they declined to postpone kickroff.
282. When Mr Marshall’s request came Mr Duckenﬁeld’s capacity to take decisions
and give orders seemed to collapse. Having sanctioned, at last, the opening of the
gates, he failed to give necessary consequential orders or to exert any control when the
disaster occurred. He misinterpreted the emergence of fans from pens 3 and 4. When
he was unsure of the problem he sent others down to “assess the situation"" rather than
descend to see for himself. He gave no information to the crowd.

283. Most surprisingly he gave Mr Kelly and others to think that there had been an
inrush due to Liverpool fans forcing open a gate. This was not only untruthful, it set
off a widely reported allegation against the supporters which caused grave offence and
distress. lt revived against football fans, and especially those from Liverpool,
accusations of hooliganism which caused reaction not only nationwide but from
Europe too. 1 can only assume that Mr Duckenfield’s lack of candour on this occasion
was out of character. He said his reason for not telling the truth was that if the crowd
became aware of it there might be a very hostile reaction and this might impede rescue
work. He did not wish to divulge what had happened until he had spoken to a senior
ofﬁcer. However, reluctance to tell Mr Kelly the truth did not require that he be told a
falsehood. Moreover, although Assistant. Chief Constable J aekson was at hand, Mr
Duckenﬁeld did not disclose the truth to him until much later.
284. The likelics’i explanation of Mr Duekenﬁeld’s conduct is that he simply could
not face the enormity of the decision to open the gates and all that flowed therefrom.
That would explain what he said to Mr Kelly, what he did not say to Mr Jackson, his
aversion to addressing the crowd and his failure to take effective control of the
disaster situation. He froze.
The Police Case at the Inquiry
285. It is a matter of regret that at the hearing and in their submissions the South
Yorkshire Police were not prepared to concede they were in any respect at fault in
what occurred. Mr Duckenﬁeld, under pressure of cross-examination, apologised for
blaming the Liverpool fans for causing the deaths. But, that apart, the police case was
to blame the fans for being late and drunk and to blame the Club for failing to monitor
the pens. It was argued that the fatal crush was not caused by the inﬂux through gate
C but was due to barrier 124a being detective. Such an unrealistic approach gives
cause for anxiety as to whether lessons have been learnt. it would have been far more
seemly and encouraging for the future if responsibility had been faced.

Murray interviewed under caution in the presence of his solicitor by a Detective Chief
Superintendent. Some 200 pages of interview. (File 6) He was told at the outset that:
“Following a public enquiry and report the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police
consulted with the Director of Public Prosecutions and as a result West Midland
police were requested to do a criminal investigation. This investigation came at the
same time as certain members of the public decided to make speciﬁc allegations
against named police ofﬁcers. You are one of those ofﬁcers and you have already
been served with Regulation 7 [disciplinary] Notice dealing with speciﬁc complaints.
The nature of those complaints and the particular duty you were performing at
Hillsborough on the 15th April 1989 suggests that you may have contributed to the
deaths of some of those that died. Also that you may have failed to perform your
lawful duty as a Police Ofﬁcer ...”
Murray was then cautioned that he did not have to say anything unless he wished to do so
“but what you say may be given in evidence”. Having answered many questions Murray was
told (483):
“The ﬁnal thing that I need to say to you is that the facts will be reported to the
Director of Public Prosecutions and it will be a matter for him to decide whether any
criminal offences have been committed.""
The appropriate Code of Practice required the caution to be given if there were grounds to
suspect a person of an offence.

DPP receives a joint opinion from Gareth Williams QC (as he then was) and Peter Bins QC
as to whether there should be presecutions. At the conclusion of the hearing I asked the DPP
to provide me with a copy, which was then made available (subject to some irrelevant editing)
to the prosecution and the defendants. I received further oral submissions dated 13,14 and 18
January. Insofar as the law is concernedthe authors of the opinion wrote:
“(2) Deﬁnition oi'manslaughﬂ
57. Involuntary manslaughter is committed when a person causes the death of another
either ( 1) intending to do an act which, Whether he knows it or not, is unlawful and
dangerous in that it is likely to cause direct personal injury (“an unlawful and
dangerous act""), or (2) intending to do an act which creates an obvious and serious
risk of causing personal injury (a) not giving thought to the possibility of such risk, or
(13) having recognised that there was some risk involved, nonetheless going on to take
it (“recklessness” as deﬁned by Lord Diplock in R. v Lawrence [1982] AC 510).
58. To amount to manslaughter a person’s conduct need not he the only cause of the
death, but it must be a substantial cause in that it contributed signiﬁcantly to the
result. Whether it did so contribute is generally a question of fact for the jury: Pagett
(1983) 76 Cr. App Rep 279, 287-91.
59. It may also he that manslaughter is committed if the person causing the death
intends to do an act, or omits to do an act Where there is a duty to do so, being grossly
negligent whether death or serious personal injury results (“gross negligence”): see
e.g. Smith and Hogan, Criminal Law, 6th ed. (1983) at p 345. The law is at present
uncertain whether gross negligence still exists as a separate head of liability, two
recent authorities having held that the earlier cases where manslaughter is defined in
terms of negligence should not he followed and that Lord Diplock’s test should be
applied universally.
60. in Seymour (1983) 76 Cr. App Rep 211, Watkins LJ, giving the judgment of the
Comt of Appeal in a reckless driving case, said:
“... we are of the view that it is no longer necessary or helpful to make
reference to compensation and negligence. The Lawrence direction on
recklessness is comprehensive and of general application to all offences,
including manslaughter involving the driving of motor vehicles recklessly and
should be given to juries without in any way being diluted. Whether a driver
at the material time was conscious of the risk he was running or gave no
thought to its existence, is a matter which affects punishment for which
purposes the judge will have to decide, if he can, giving the beneﬁt of doubt to

the convicted person, in which state of mind that person had driven at the
material time.”
61. In Kong (.‘hcuk Kwan v R (1985) 82 Cr. App Rep 18 Lord Roskill, giving the
opinion of the Privy Council, said at p 25: ‘
“Their Lordships are of the View that the present state of the relevant law in
England and Wales is clear. The model direction suggested in Lawrence
and held in Seymour equally applicable to cases of motor manslaughter
requires, ﬁrst, that the vehicle was in fact being driven in such a manner as to
create an obvious and serious risk of causing physical injury to another and
secondly that the defendant so drove either without having given any thought
to the possibility of there being such a risk or having recognised that there was
such a risk nevertheless took it.
In principle their Lordships see no reason why a comparable direction should
not have been given in the present case as regards that part of the case which
concerned the alleged navigation of the Flying Goldﬁnch by Kong and indeed
as regards the alleged navigation of the Flying Flamingo by the other two
defendants. Did their respective acts of navigation create an obvious and
serious risk of causing physical damage to some other ship and thus to other
persons who might have been travelling in the area of the collision at the
material time? If so did any of the defendants so navigate either without
having given any thought to the possibility of that risk or, while recognising
that the risk existed, take that risk?”
At p 26, Lord Roskill said:
“Their Lordships respectively agree with the comment made by Watkins LJ
in ﬂaw?”
62. However, as pointed out by Smith and Hogan (6th ed. (1988) at p 353), whilst the
clear implication from Kong Cheuk Kwan is that there is no longer any separate test
01‘ gross negligence in manslaughter, it may be that the courts would not be prepared
to exclude it altogether in an appropriate case. Some support for this view is found in
Goodfellow (1986) 83 Cr. App Rep 23, where Lord Lane LCJ said that the question in
Kong Cheuk Kwan was whether the defendant was “guilty of recklessness (or gross
negligence)”.
63. We consider it right in the circumstances of Hillsborough to approach the
evidence on the basis that the gross negligence test is sufﬁcient to establish the
offence of manslaughter and we propose to advise accordingly.
(3) Neglect by police
64. When gross negligence or manslaughter by neglect is alleged against the police,
however, authority indicates a more detailed test of liability. In R v West London
Coroner’s CourtI ex 1; Gray [1988] QB 467, allegations were made against police
following the death of a man while in police custody concerning the use of force
against him and failure to summon an ambulance promptly when he became
unconscious. The coroner‘s directions to the jury as to unlawful killing were quashed
by the Divisional Court, which held that a coroner directing a jury on manslaughter
comprising unlawful killing alleged to have occurred because of neglect by police was
required to direct them as follows:
_ l0 _

verdict or further order.
(1) that they had to be satisﬁed of four ingredients, namely (a) that the police
were under a duty to have regard to the health and welfare of the deceased, (b)
that in the circumstances there was a failure to do what should have been done
for the health and welfare of the deceased. (c) that the failure amounted to a
substantial cause of death, and (d) that the failure amounted to recklessness;
(2) that the test of “recklessness” was whether a police ofﬁcer, having regard
to his duty, was indifferent to an obvious and serious risk to the health and
welfare of the deceased or, recognising that risk to be present, deliberately
chose to run it by doing nothing about it;
(3) that a failure to appreciate that there was such a risk was not by itsell‘
sufﬁcient to amount to recklessness; and
(4) that the jury could only return a verdict of unlawful killing if they could
attribute the unlawful conduct to a single police ofﬁcer.
65. Plainly those directions are those to be given in any criminal prosecution of a
police ofﬁcer where omission to act is alleged to have caused death. In our view they
have a direct bearing on our consideration of the evidence in this case.""
In relation to Chief Superintendent Duckeuﬁeld the authors wrote:
“87, Clearly there was no unlawful and dangerous act on his part or intended by him
which would found the ﬁrst head of liability in involuntary manslaughter. But in
failing to postpone the kickoff, or to order the closure of the tunnel alter the opening
of gate C, or both, did he intend an act which created an obvious and serious risk of
causing personal injury, either not giving thought to the possibility of such risk, or
having recognised that there was some risk involved nonetheless go onto take it?
88. We consider that there are difﬁcrdties in proving that he intended to do an act
which created an obvious and serious risk of causing personal injury. In the ﬁrst place
there was no “act” as such, but an omission or omissions to act which contributed to a
rapidly developing state of affairs ending in serious risk of injury. But was it an
obvious risk at the time? We think not. The complexity of the disaster as now known
to those who have analysed it in hindsight demonstrates that there must be grave
doubt as to whether the omissions created a risk which was obvious to anyone at the
time. The considerations here are, of course, wholly different from the driving cases
or the collision at sea in the Kong Cheuk Kwan case.
89. We conclude, therefore, that there is insufﬁcient evidence on which to found a
charge of recklessness against Mr Duckenﬁeld. Nor is there evidence that he was
grossly negligent in failing to act as mentioned above. We bear in mind particularly
the judgment of the Divisional Court in the West London Coroner’s Court case, the
requirements of which are not in our view satisﬁed.
90. It follows, and we have come to the clear conclusion. that there is no evidence
that Mr Duckenﬁeld was wilfully neglectful of his duty or was culpable so as to have
committed the otl‘ence ol‘culpable misfeasance.
91. We conclude that there is no sufﬁcient evidence of any criminal offence having
been committed by Mr Duckenﬁeld.”

DPP announces that there will be no prosecutions. In a letter to HESG dated 27 July 1998,
the CPS explained in outline the 1990 decision. The letter explained that the CPS code
requires a Crown prosecutor to be satisﬁed that there is enough evidence to provide a realistic
prospect of conviction, that is, a conviction is more likely than not. The letter went on to
state that the reason for not presecuting was the insufﬁciency of evidence to justify criminal
proceedings.

were represented at the hearing by Mr Alun Jones QC and Mr Edward Fitzgerald. The
Divisional Court refused an application to add an allegation against the Coroner of apparent
bias. That proposed new ground had been advanced at the end of October 1993. The Court
also refused an application to add a further ground relating to the Coroner’s direction upon

the elements of the offence of manslaughter. McCowan LJ. giving his judgment, with which
Turner .l. agreed, said: (pages 8-9 of the transcript)
“Assuming, without deciding, that there was a misdirection. no blame can be attached
to the Coroner since he summed up as he was told to do by the Divisional Court and
with the approval of counsel for the relatives. That Mr Jones accepts. What exactly is
it that Mr Jones would have the Coroner say? He gave us a long passage ending with
these words:
‘... that the attempted avoidance of the perceived risk, namely by opening the
gates, was attended by such a high degree of negligence that it justiﬁes a
conviction for unlawful killing”.
So directed, hc submits, the jury could have found unlawful killing. But there is
nothing to say they would have done. The verdict they in fact brought in was a
perfectly rational one.
What then, we ask, would be the point of sending the matter back for another inquest?
Mr Jones’s answer was that, whatever the verdict might prove to be, the function of
the jury would have been fulﬁlled. He agreed that no prosecution of any police officer
would result because the decision was taken as long ago as September 1990 (before
the main inquest) that no one should be prosecuted. It is, he said, a point of legal
purity.""
In rejecting the application to add this ground the Court took the view that it had been made
far too late and, if successful. would have achieved nothing of value.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report presented to Parliament. Having considered and rejected
the allegations contained in the Hillsborough ﬁlm, he concluded that there was no basis for
any further public enquiry and no basis for a renewed application to quash the verdict of the
inquest, that there was no material that should be put before the DPP or the police disciplinary
authorities. He further concluded that none of the evidence which he had been asked to
consider added anything signiﬁcant to the evidence that was available to Lord Taylor’s
inquiry or to the inquests. He considered the alterations to statements and said that it would
have been preferable if alterations to a few of the statements had not been made. He wrote in
paragraph 57:
“The causes of the disaster were many and complex. So far as the [defendants] were
concerned, the prosecution would have to prove to the high standard required for a
criminal Conviction that the failure to give the order to close Off the tunnel when Gate
C was opened amounted to a serious degree of recklessness necessary to constitute
manslaughter”
The Home Secretary announced in Parliament that he. the Attorney General and the DPP had
each considered the report very carefully and had no reason to doubt the conclusions. The
Minister said that the system had failed the families and cited a passage from Chapter 7 of his
report, in which Stuart—Smith LJ wrote that he understood the dismay felt by the families that
no individual has been personally held to account in a criminal court, in disciplinary
proceedings or even to the extent oflosiug his job.

Under the headline “Revealed: Hillsborough Police altered statements“ the Sunday Telegraph
reported: (Tab 3/76 ofMedia File):
”Dozens of statements made by police oilicers on duty at the Hillsborough soccer
ground at the time of the disaster were altered to remove their initial criticisms of the
South Yorkshire force, an investigation by The Sunday Telegraph has found.
Hundreds of sentences which criticised crowd control at the 1989 FA Cup semi~ﬁnal
at the Shefﬁeld ground were deleted or amended.
The original written recollections were changed within a month on the advice of
solicitors acting for South Yorkshire police or the force itself. It was the amended
statements which were presented to future inquiries into the disaster. Today’s
disclosures put renewed pressure on Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, to order a new
public inquiry just weeks before the 10th anniversary of the tragedy, in which
overcrowding and late arrivals led to 96 people being crushed to death and another
400 injiu‘ed.
Trevor Hicks, chairman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group (HFSG), said
yesterday the new study revealed a scale of statement altering which had been greatly
underestimated by Lord Justice Stuart—Smith’s “scrutiny of evidence"" last year.
“The sheer scale of the altering of the statements is an absolute disgrace,” said Mr
Hicks, who lost his only two children, Sarah 19, and Victoria, 15, at the match.
The disclosures come as Mr Straw faced growing criticism yesterday of the bungled
handling of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry report.
Yesterday South Yorkshire police denied that there was a need for a public inquiry
and said the alterations had been examined by Lord Stuart—Smith who decided they
did not affect the inquiries’ outcomes or the l991 inquest where the jury returned
verdicts of accidental death,”
The statements referred to are, it appears, the statements which had been considered by
Stuart-Smith LJ and deposited in the House of Commons library by the Home Secretary
following his annolmcement. That theme was developed in the independent (3/77) and
Yorkshire Post (3/78) on 1.03.99. The Yorkshire Post cited Mr Hicks as saying that all that
Stuart—Smith had done was to “scrimp” across the surface.

The Independent publishes a review of Professor Seraton’s new book:
“I read this book in a fog of anger. At. the disaster itself. naturally, but also at the way
the establishment ganged together to make sure that the truth - a scarcely believable
story of incompetence and mendacity » was never oﬁicially told.
Let’s establish a couple of facts: Hillsborough was not caused by alcohol and
violence; Liverpool people had not, in Brian Clough’s words, “killed their own"". A
combination of police incompetence and structural defects at the ground caused the
disaster. How the world reacted to it was conditioned by the ﬁrst action of the man in
charge, Chief Superintendent David Duckenﬁeld (who had no experience of such
events): he informed Graham Kelly that Gate C had been forced by drunken fans.
In fact it was opened by the police. Kelly innocently passed this on in a TV interview.
One is leﬁ hoping that Mr Duckenﬁeld, who retired through “ill health” to pre—empt
disciplinary proceedings, wakes up every morning full of remorse.
Afterwards the police questioned survivors and bereaved with appalling insensitivity,
trying desperately to establish that Leppings Lane that Saturday aﬂernoon had been
populated by insensate, aggressive dI‘llIlk‘dIdS intent on self—destruction.

The day aﬁer the events of 10 years before had been marked in Liverpool by a minute of
silence and in Anticld Stadium by speeches and music, the Independent reported that the
families and the entire city of Liverpool “want to see police ofﬁcers in the dock, charged
with neglect and incompetence”. “Yesterday was all about remembrance. It did credit to a
city and its people in its simplicity and reverence. But under the surface the rage and cries for
revenge and punishment are still strong. It may be that someday those now broken and
despised men, like Chief Superintendent David Duckenﬁeld and several of his named
colleagues, may have to answer for their disastrous decisions on that day. Others may have to
explain the lies and deceit that was rife among South Yorkshire police in the following years.
But they did not set out to kill anyone on that spring afternoon. It was the Glory game itself.”
(Tah 3191-92 of Media File) The Mirror reported on the same day the words of Mr Hicks at
the Stadium referring to the astonishing verdict of the coroner’s jury and to the alteration of
150 statements. many signiﬁcantly, “Lf that isn’t wrong I don’t know what is.” The Full text

Duckenﬁeld and Murray, unreported 31/01/1999 (bundle 12 divider I’Q). Giving the
judgment of the Divisional Court, Laws L] said:
“Representations had ﬁrst been made to the DPP on behalf of D [Duckenﬁeld] and M
[Murray] in early July 1998, alter the commencement of the proceedings in the South
Sefton Petty Sessional Division which proved abortive. In the course of
correspondence the I-[FSG again contended that it had discovered new evidence,
which, it was said, had not been before Lord Taylor, the DPP, the Coroner, or Stuart-
Smith L]. At length, after AA's [Ann Adlington] informations had been laid in the
Leeds Petty Sessional Division, the considered views of the DPP as to the approach to
be taken to a request to take over and discontinue a private prosecution were set out in
a letter to the HFSG on 27 J uly 1998. The letter did not contain a decision, but it
explained the DPP’s policy:
The policy where proceedings have been commenced by a private prosecutor
builds on that contained in the Code for Crown Prosecutors. The right to bring
a private prosecution is preserved by 5.6(1)... subject to the power under 5.6(2).
The CPS will take over a private prosecution where there is a particular need
for it to do so on behalf of the public...
In the instant case where we have been asked by the defendants to take over
the prosecution in order to discontinue it, we would do so it‘ one (or more) of
the following circumstances applies:

I There is clearly no case to answer. A private prosecution
commenced in these circlunstances would be unfounded, and
would, therefore be an abuse of the right to bring a prosecution.

- The public interest factors tending against prosecution clearly
outweigh those factors tending in favour.

I The prosecution is clearly likely to damage the interests of justice.

The CPS would then regard imelf as having to act in accordance with our
policy.
If none of the above apply there would be no need for the CPS to become
involved and we would not interfere with the private prosecution.
Clearly there is a distinction between the ‘realistic prospect of conviction’ test
in the Code [the Code for Crown Prosecutors issued by the DPP under s.l0 of
the 1985 Act] and the ‘clearly no case to answer‘ test mentioned above.
Accordingly we recognise that there will be some cases which do not meet the
CPS Code tests where nevertheless we will not intervene. It has been
considered that to apply the Code tests to private prosecutions would unfairly
limit the right of individuals to bring their own cases.
Before this decision can properly be made the CPS must be assured that all
relevant material has been considered...
Until there has been a detailed review of the many papers in the case the
Crown’s position cannot be detennined...’
There followed very substantial representations from D and M and from the I—[FSG
the DPP conununicated his decision not to intervene, as I have said by letter of 18
December 1998. The letter merely stated:
‘We have considered the evidence, the representations made by the parties and
all the relevant circumstances of the case. We have concluded that we should
not intervene to take over any of the charges.”

The cement; of this ruling waging published until R v Duukuntiuld and Murray
Erdmt or hither—order-
The respective solicitors for D and M asked for reasons to be given. There followed a
letter of 1 February 1999 (the ‘reasons letter‘) from the CPS” Casework Director to
M's solicitor form which it is necessary to cite at some length:
‘As you know, the Code for Crown Prosecutors sets out the general principles
applied by the Service when (inter alia) deciding whether to continue a
prosecution it has taken over; or whether to institute proceedings, or whether
to advise the police to do so. It is correct that the CPS decided in 1997 that the
evidence available at that time was not sufficient, in its View, to provide a
realistic prospect of the conviction of either your client or Mr Duckenﬁeld for
any offence. However, it does not follow that, when considering the evidence
and the representations submitted by the private prosecutor, and by yourselves
on behalf of your client, the CPS should seek merely to identify whether there
is now any new evidence sufﬁcient to provide a realistic prospect of a
conviction. The decision whether to intervene in a private prosecution with a
view to terminating it calls for different considerations to be applied. It is
quite possible for a private prosecution to continue, notwithstanding that the
CPS is not satisﬁed, on the basis of its own assessment of the strength of the
evidence, that the evidence would pass the evidential sufficiency test in the
Code (that there should be a ‘realistic prospect of a conviction’).
In broad terms, the reason for this is that s.ﬁ(l)... speciﬁcally preserved the
right of private individuals and prosecuting authorities and bodies other than
the CPS to bring criminal proceedings. This right is subject (among other
limitations) to the limitation in 5.6(2) that the CPS may nevertheless take over
the proceedings with a view either to conducting or to terminating those
proceedings.
Private prosecutors are not bound to apply the Code for Crown Prosecutors
when deciding whether to institute proceedings, nor do the courts apply the
evidential sufﬁciency test in the Code when deciding whether there is a case to
answer. The Service therefore recognises that it is not appropriate to intervene
to terminate a private prosecution without good reason. That general principle
has recently been endorsed by the Law Commission in its Consultation Paper
No. 149 ‘Consents to Prosecution’ (see paragraphs 6.3 and 6.4).
[The letter then proceeds to set out the DPP‘s policy in the same terms as those
in which it had earlier been described by the three “bullet-points” in the letter
of 27 July 1998, save that it gives instances of the “public interest factors"" test
as follows:
‘examples might be where the prosecution is malicious, or vexatious;
or the oﬁ'ence is one for which the defendant should clearly have been
cautioned; or where, although the offence may be serious, the
defendant is terminally ill.’
Then the letter continues as follows]
In this case, i took the decision not to intervene... 1 concluded in respect of the
charges of manslaughter and wilful neglect to perform a public duty (which,
for the avoidance of doubt, were each considered against each individual
separately) that i could not say that there is clearly no case to answer. It was
not right, therefore, for the Service to take over the proceedings with a view to
terminating them.
I also considered whether, nevertheless, there were oven‘iding public interest
factors that should lead to the Service intervening with a View to

The Divisional court concluded that the DPP’s policy was a lawful one (page 22). The Court
went on to consider what it described as the real question: had the policy been lawfully
applied? Dealing with the DPP‘s judgment on the issue of public interest, the Court said:
“Mr Harrison submitted that in the light of everything that had gone before, and not
least Stuart-Smith [.J’s Scrutiny, there were no public interest factors favouring
continuation of the prosecutions of D and M. He said that there is nothing in the
reasons letter to show that the DPP accepted the suggestion, urged forcefully and at
length by the HFSG in the course of their representations, that further evidence had
come to light since the Sanitiny. With this latter proposition I agree. But the reasons
letter clearly implies an acceptance that some factors existed which favoured the
prosecutions. It stated: “I came to the conclusion that any public interest factors
tending against prosecution did not clearly outweigh those in favour”. What were
those in favour? If in truth there were no factors which a reasonable decision—maker
could regard as going in favour of the prosecutions, then the DPP’s decision would be
vulnerable to a challenge on Wednesbury grounds (as indeed Mr Harrison claims it is)
since there would be nothing in public interest terms to weight in the scales against
discontinuance. When the case was opened there was no afﬁdavit from the DPP
dealing with the point, nor did Mr Havers’ skeleton argument articulate any such
factors, Mr Newell swore an affidavit for the DPP On 22 March 1999. He is the CPS’
Director of Casework and the author of the reasons letter. Paras 2 - 4 are as follows:
‘2. As 1 now recall, the public interest factors tending against prosecution
which 1 considered were as follows:
(1) Previous reviews of the case, in partiCular those carried out by the
DPP when considering the question whether criminal proceedings
should be taken against Mr Duckcnﬁeld and Mr Murray and the more
recent report of Lord Justice Stuart—Smith.
(2) The fact that the Applicants had been told on previous occasions
that the DPP did not intend to prosecute.
(3) The delay which had occurred between the commission of the
alleged offences and the commencement of the prosecution and its
likely effect on the Applicants, although I took the view that delay may
be offset by the seriousness of the alleged offences (as is reﬂected in
paragraph 6.5(d) ol' the Code...).
(4) The effect of the delay on the evidence, for example in terms of the
potential impairment of the recollections of witnesses.
(5) The assertion made on behalf of Mr Murray of ill-health, although
I noted that no medical evidence had been put forward in support of
this assertion and that, as again reﬂected in the Code (at paragraph
6.5(e)). illvhealth may be offset by the seriousneSS of the offence,
3. As against these factors tending against prosecution, there was in my view
one extremely important factor in favour of prosecution, namely the very
serious nature of the alleged offences, in particular, the alleged offences of
manslaughter. in my opinion, the allegation that two senior police ofﬁcers

were responsible for the deaths of a number of people as a result of criminal
negligence was a very grave allegation.
4. Paragraph 6.2 of the Code reﬂects the considerable weight attached by the
CPS to the seriousness of the alleged offence when seeking to strike the right
balance as to the factors for and against prosecution. (I refer also to the
opening words of paragraph 6.4) Having carefully considered the factors
tending against prosecution and this extremely important factor in favour of it,
I came to the firm conclusion that the factors tending against prosecution did
not clearly outweigh what I considered to be the very strong public interest in
favour of prosecution.’
One of Mr Harrison’s complaints, advanced before this affidavit was sworn. was that
the policy should have taken account of para 10.1 of the Code which includes this:
‘Normally, if the Crown Prosecution Service tells a suspect or defendant that
there will not be a prosecution... that is the end of the matter... But
Occasionally there are special reasons why the Crown Prosecution Service will
rc-start the prosecution, particularly if the case is serious.”
This is one of the points relating to the Code which, as it seems to me, hear on the
application of the policy rather than the policy itself; and para 2(2) of Mr Newell’s
afﬁdavit shows that regard was had to assurances or statements made to D and M that
for his part the DPP would not prosecute. Clearly it was right to do so, within the
public interest balance. But I think there is a qualitative difference between the
situation where the DPP himself goes back upon a previous assurance not to prosecute
and one where the DPP does not change his mind but a private prosecutor chooses to
instigate proceedings.
In reply, having by then seen Mr Newell’s afﬁdavit, Mr Harrison madc further
submissions. While accepting that there could he a case in which a single factor
favouring prosecution might not be outweighed by a multiplicity of factors going the
other way, he submitted that if the raﬁ of public interest considerations favouring
discontinuance in this case was held not to be enough to outweigh the single factor of
the allegations’ gravity, it was difficult or impossible to imagine what set of
considerations might do so; and the court should conclude that DPP had fettered his
discretion by treating the seriousness of the allegations as overriding everything else,
so that he had not in truth carried out a proper balancing exercise at all.
I would reject this argument. There is no reason to suppose that the factors against
prosecution were not properly weighed and considered, and certainly no basis for the
supposition that once faced with a private prosecution for something as serious as
manslaughter the DPP would inevitably decide to allow it to proceed.
Mr Harrison submitted next that Mr Newell’s affidavit showed that the DPP had
transposed from the Code the ‘seriousness of the charge’ factor as a consideration
favouring the prosecution without also taking account of his own view that the Code
test of “realistic prospect of conviction” was not met. I agree that the DPP’s view of
the prospects of conviction is a proper matter for him to consider, within the public
interest test contained in the policy, when deciding whether to discontinue; but, as it
seems to me, para 2(1) oer Newell’s afﬁdavit shows that in this case he has done
80.
Then Mr Harrison suggested that para 3 of the afﬁdavit demonstrated that the DPP’s
View of the gravity of the allegation was informed simply by the fact that there was a
manslaughter charge. He had not properly considered the real degree of culpability
inherent in the facts alleged; and the gravity of the offence of manslaughter can vary
very widely. There is nothing in this. Mr Newell made it perfectly clear that he had

sensibly be doubted that he was well aware and took account of the circumstances in
which the alleged offences are said to have been committed.
Lastly on this part of the case Mr Harrison submitted that the refusal to discontinue
was simply perverse, given the ‘enormous weight’ of the public interest considerations
going the other way.
The DPP might, in my judgment, lawfully have decided to discontinue. The tragic
events at Hillsborougi have been the subject of repeated, detailed, thorough enquiries.
Nearly ten years have passed. But the judgment was for the DPP to make. If we
acceded to Mr Harrison‘s submission, we would I think usurp the role of the primary
deeisiommaker.
In my judgment the decision not to diseontinuc is no more unlawful than is the policy
which the DPP applied.”
An application brought by the prosecution seeking to prevent the funding of the two
defendants by the South Yorkshire Police was also dismissed. If that second application had
been successful then ﬂie defendants would have had to pay for their own representation or,
subject to a means enquiry, seek legal aid.

Following a ﬁve day hearing during which it was submitted on behalf of the defendants that
the proceedings should be stayed, Mr Nigel Cadbury, Stipendiary Magistrate, dismissed the
application and, in doing so, concluded: “The defence have not persuaded me to the required
standard of proof that a fair trial is not possible"". (Vol. 8 tab 7) The prosecution prepared for
the committal proceedings an opening note. (Vol. 8 tab 1 pages 1—13) For the purposes of the
hearing the prosecution prepared a “Revised Skeleton Argument of the Prosecution on Abuse
of Process"". Paragraph 73 reads in part: “Present leading counsel was involved in the judicial
review from September 1993 to November 1993 and from December 1996. He was not
asked to advise on criminal law until 1998.“ During argument, Mr Jones made a correction to
that.

it has not been updated since October 26. (Tab 6 of Media ﬁle) Above the name of Mr Phil

Publicity following the hearing

Following the hearing 1 was asked my tentative views about the showing of a repeat of 3
episodes of Cracker, a ﬁctional series starring Robbie Coltrane as a forensic psychologist.
The episodes concerned a young man who was at Hillsborough and resolves to kill 96 people,
principally police ofﬁcers. I reached the tentative conclusion that I would not be prepared to
grant an injunction. Understandably, no injunction was thereafter sought. I have also been
sent material in the public domain reporting and commenting upon an award of damages for a
nurse who suffered PTSD as a result of help which she gave at Hillsborough.

Ereliminary observations

Mr Jones submits that the test for manslaughter is that which, hc argues, was laid down by the
House of Lords in Adorn-aka [1995] 1 AC 181. Manslaughter will be proved if it is shown
that:

a) That the defendant owed the deceased a duty of care;

b) That he was negligent;

c) That his negligent actions or omissions were a substantial cause of death;

(1) That, having regard to the risk of death involved, the conduct of the defendant was so
bad in all the circumstances to amount, in the judgment of the jury, to a criminal act or
omission.

If this is the correct test, then, it seems to me, that it was not the test applied by the authors of
the 1990 opinion, which includes a subjective element.

Mr Harrison in his written submission prepared aﬁer receipt of counsel‘s 1990 opinion, now
argues that Mr Jones’ suggested test , although applicable to medical negligence, is not the
test for cases of the present kind. Relying particularly on a passage in Lord Mackay‘s speech

vgrgigg gr fpghg; grdgr. _
Wm
in Adomako and his apparent approval of Stone and Dobinson [1977] QB and Ex parte
my (referred to in that opinion), M Harrison submits that the prosecution must additionally
prove that the defendant was at least indifferent to the risk of serious injury (para. 7 of note
dated lit/0119000). If this is right, then manslaughter in this kind of case requires a subjective
element. He further submits that, therefore, the test applied by the authors of the opinion
remains the correct one.
This is not the time for me to reach any ﬁnal conclusion on the matter. Nor is it necessary for
me to deal with a further matter relating to breach of duty raised by Mr Clcgg in his written
submission dated 18 January 2000.
Inote that Mr Harrison’s submissions do not seem to receive the support of Professor Smith,
Criminal Law, Smith and Hogan, 9Ih edition, page 376677, where it is argued that there is
now only one “single, simple test of gross negligence”, an objective one. Hake the view that
it is, at least, arguable (with the great beneﬁt of hindsight) that the authors of the opinion did
not apply the correct test. There is nothing to suggest that this error, if error it be, was
recognised when the matter was reconsidered in 1997. I should add that an examination of
the judgment in the Divisional Court in March 1999 does not suggest that it was being argued
by Mr Harrison that Mr Newell had erred in reaching the conclusion that the “no evidence
test” was not met. If the proper test for manslaughter involves a subjective element of the
kind for which he now contends, one might have expected Mr Harrison to have argued that
the “no evidence test” was met.
The stipendiary magistrate has found that both defendants have a case to answer. It was not
and could not, as a matter of procedure, be suggested before me that this decision was wrong.
He gave no reasons and] am therefore unsure which test he applied. I suspect that it was the
test propounded by Mr Jones.
The Director of Public Prosecutions in the person of Mr Christopher Newell has reached the
conclusion that the DPP should not intervene and take over the prosecution to bring it to an
end. As 1 have already mentioned, the policy and the decision were analysed in detail by the
Divisional Court in March last year and the policy was found to be lawful and the decision
not one that should be quashed.
The delay has bee—n such that no thigtrial is possible
] propose to deal with this submission ﬁrst. During the course of the hearing I made it clear
that I did not accept it. As the prosecution’s case now stands, all or almost all of the evidence

upon which the prosecution rely is the evidence upon which Lord Justice Taylor relied to
reach his conclusions. Signiﬁcant parts of the evidence are recorded on video tapes which
have been edited into a compilation tape. 1 have seen that tape and, in my view formed at this
early stage of the proceedings, it will provide an invaluable and objective account of what
happened that afternoon in so far as relevant to these proceedings. This is not a case where
anyone involved that day, witness or defendant, is going to forget what happened.
Mr Harrison submitted that the defendants could be faced with insuperable difﬁculties when
examining whether, if thought had been given to closing off the tunnel, it would have been
possible or practicable so to do. It is now too late, he submits, to know, for example, which
police officers could have been used to close it off. Experience shows that judges must be
cautious when arguments of this kind are submitted. In my own experience, having rejected
similar submissions, I have found that, at the trial, the difficulties proved non—existent. At the
present time and having regard, for example, to the video tape, 1 cannot see how such a
difﬁculty may arise. The tape shows a number of ofﬁcers inside the gates. As a result of the
opening of the gates, some of those ofﬁcers, such as those who had been searching, could no
longer perform that task. If I am wrong and the difﬁculties outlined by Mr Harrison prove to
be real difﬁculties then I have the power at any stage to either stop the case or make some less
draconian ruling. Likewise Mr Harrison expresses concern should the prosecution seek to
rely on experience gained at earlier matches. Should the prosecution seek to do this I will, if
asked, consider whether it would be fair to do so having regard to the delay.
The publicig has been such‘thatng fair trial is possible.
There is no doubt that there has been a massive amount of adverse publicity about the role of
the police and of senior police officers on and alter the day of the disaster at Hillsborough. It
was submitted on behalf of the defendants that the publicity has been more adverse than in
any other case. Mr Jones submitted that the publicity in the Maxwell case, particularly as far
as Robert Maxwell was concerned, was as adverse, if not more adverse.
Itum to the appropriate legal principles. In Maxwell and others, unreported, March 5 1995,
Phillips J, as he then was, referred to the “unrelenting adverse media publicity” about Mr
Robert Maxwell, whose “name has become a synonym for fraud” (page 53). Phillips J said
that there had “been signiﬁcant adverse publicity to Mr Kevin and Mr Ian Maxwell.” In
ruling against an application to quash the proceedings on this ground, Phillips J said:

“I am satisﬁed, nonetheless, that the effect of pro-trial publicity alone can constitute a
valid ground for ordering a stay of proceedings. The principles that govern the
exercise of such jurisdiction merit careful consideration.
No stay should be imposed unless the Defendant shows on the balance of probabilities
that owing to the extent and the nature of the pro-trial publicity he will suffer serious
prejudice to the extent that no fair trial can be held.
I would accept this test, so far as it goes, but it remains necessary to identify the
essential aspects of a fair trial for the purpose of the test.
if it were enough to render a trial untair that publicity has created the risk of prejudice
against the Defendant our system of criminal justice would be seriously ﬂawed. There
will inevitably be cases where the facts are so dramatic that almost everyone in the
lands will know of them. There will be circumstances when arrests are made or
Defendants whose guilt will. or may, appear likely. intense media coverage may well
take place before a suspect is identiﬁed or apprehended. If in the most notorious cases
Defendants were to claim immunity from trial because of the risk of prejudice public
conﬁdence in the criminal justice system would be destroyed.” (Pages 60-62)
Having given two examples Alcindor (The herald of Free Enterprise) and
Savundranayagan, he went on to say:
“Our system of criminal justice is founded on the belief that the jury trial provides the
fairest and most reliable method of determining whether guilt is established. This
belief is based on the premise that that the jury will do their best to be true to their
oath and to try the case according to the evidence. The ability of the jury to disregard
extrinsic material has been repeatedly emphasised by judges of great experience.""
Phillips J then cited passages from judgments given by Lawton J in Kray, and as Lawton L]
in Coughlan, by Lord Denning and Sir John Donaldson in AG v. News Group Newspapers
Ltd [1987] QB 1, ln Kray, LawtonJ said:
“It is a matter of human experience, and certainly a matter of the experience of
those who practise in the criminal cotuts, ﬁrst that the public‘s recollection is short
and, secondly, that the drama, if I may use that term, of a trial almost always has the
effect of excluding from recollection that which went before.”
As to recollections being short, my own experience may be of interest. When I ﬁrst came to
this case last year I thought that the criticism of the senior police ofﬁcer on the day (whose
name I did not recollect) was that he had ordered the opening of the gates when he ought not
to have done. I now know that it is aceepted that the order to open the gates was the proper
course to take.
Lawton J went on to say that a juror would not disqualify himself merely by reading
newspapers containing discreditable allegations unless his mind had become so “clogged with
prejudice that he was unable to try the case impartially”.

Again my own experience may be ol'interesl. in a trial last year of a. doctor charged with the
murder of an elderly and very sick patient in great pain, two potential jurors, without being
asked, both indicated that they were unable to act as jurors because of their views on the topic
of euthanasia, one being apparently in favour and one against.
in AG v. News Group Newspapers Ltd Sir John Donaldson said (page 16):
“.. a trial by its very nature, seems to cause all concerned to become progressively
more inward looking, studying the evidence given and submissions made to the
exclusion of other sources of enlightenment. This is a well-known phenomenon.""
Phillips J went on to say:
“How then, in the case such as this, should the Court approach the question of
whether pre—trial publicity has made a fair trial impossible? I am inclined to think Mr
Lawson provided the answer when he advanced by way of submission the following
test:
“if prejudicial publicity would, in hindsight result in a conviction being unsafe
and rmsatisfactory, it cannot at fortiori. be fair to embark on a trial which may
so result.”
it seems to me that the Court will only be justiﬁed in slaying a trial on the ground of
adverse pre—trial publicity, if satisﬁed on balance ofprobabilitics that if the jury return
a verdict of guilty, the effect of the pre-trial publicity will be such as to render that
verdict unsafe and unsatisfactory.
In considering this question the Court has to consider the likely length of time the jury
will be subject to the trial process, the issues that are likely to arise and the evidence
that is likely to be called in order to form a View as to whether it is probable that - ﬂy
as they may to disregard the pre—trial publicity - the jury's verdict will be rendered
unsafe on account of it.
i now turn to consider whether the Defendants have satisﬁed me that because of the
pro-trial publicity, a lair trial cannot take place.
The second point to consider is the possibility of potential jurors whose minds - to use
the words of Lawton J — have become clogged with prejudice as a result of adverse
publicity. That such there may be is indicated by some of the answers to the opinion
polls and by compelling oral evidence given by Mr Kevin Maxwell on this
application. They also must be identiﬁed by an appropriate process of jury
questioning.
The question then remains of whether jurors who set out to perform their duties in
accordance with their oaths will, by the end of the trial, he at risk of acting under the
inﬂuence of publicity rather than reaching their verdicts on the basis of the evidence
that they have heard in Court.
Let me deal ﬁrst with prejudice that may have been engendered by publicity adverse
to particular Defendants. So far as Mr Trachtenberg and Mr Bunn are concerned, their
Counsel did not suggest that such publicity as there has been about them would
prevent their having a fair trial. I think it unlikely that any juror would even
remember their names.

The adverse publicity that there has been directed against Mr Kevin and Mr Ian
Maxwell is far more signiﬁcant, Nonetheless 1 do not consider it that it is such as to
pose a threat to the fairness of the trial. it is too early yet to form a precise estimate of
the duration of this trial. I have no doubt, however, it will run for a period of months.
The phenomenon spoken to by Sir John Donaldson of becoming more inward looking
and studying the evidence and submissions to the exclusion of other forms of
enlightenment is one of which I have had personal experience in the context of a long
fraud trial. It is something that it is impossible to exaggerate. As the weeks go by the
trial becomes not merely part of life, but the dominant feature of it so that the stage is
reached when one can hardly see behind it or beyond it, andl am quite sure that this is
truly true of all involved in the trial.
The responsibility of reaching verdicts is a heavy one is any case, but in a case such as
this it is one of which the jury will be particularly aware. I do not believe that their
verdicts will be inﬂuenced by anything that they may have read about individual
Defendants before the trial begins. Nor can I accept the suggestion made by Mr Jones
that they will permit their verdicts to be inﬂuenced by views expressed by ﬁiends or
relatives outside court.” (Pages 72-76)
Phillips J went on to consider the publicity surrounding the late Mr Robert Maxwell and said:
“on reﬂection, I am not persuaded that, if he were to stand trial, a jury would not try him
fairly and reach verdicts on the evidence” (page 77).
It will be remembered that the defendants in the Maxwell case were acquitted by the jury.
I turn to this case applying the principles enunciated by Phillips I It is anticipated that the
trial will take about 6 weeks, although it may well be shorter. Certainly it will last long
enough for the phenomenon of which Sir John Donaldson and Phillips I spoke, to take effect.
It can be assumed that every potential juror will know about Hillsborough and be appalled by
the death of 96 people, many of whom were so young, and feel the greatest sympathy for the
relatives of those who lost their lives, particularly the parents of the young. That assumption
can be made in many high proﬁle trials. In addition to those mentioned by Phillips J we have
the more recent examples of Rosemary West and Dr Shipman. it can also be assumed that
every potential juror may well feel that someone must be at fault for the tragedy, whether the
police, the fans or the Club. In this case it is noteworthy that at the Inquest the jury brought in
verdicts of accidental death, knowing, as they must have done, that the families of the
deceased, many of Whom were present at the hearings, would be deeply disappointed if not
devastated by the verdict. I see no reason why a jury cannot be chosen all members of which
will try the case on the evidence before them.
It can also be assumed that every potential juror may well have read or heard about an alleged
police cover-up aﬁer the disaster. Any concern about that may be met by making it clear to
the jury, if need be, that the alleged cover-up has nothing to do with these defendants and that,

in any event, many of the allegations made against the police inspired by Jimmy McGovem’s
film have no foundation. Furthermore questions could be so framed to exclude anyone who
has read, for example, Professor Scraton’s book.
Are there any special features in this case which might have the effect that a juror’s mind
could be “clogged with prejudice as a result of adverse publicity”. Counsel point particularly
to the song contained in the Manic Street Preachers album to which I have made reference.
Although many copies have been sold, it would be easy to select jurors who have not heard
the song. In any event, with all respect to the persons responsible for it and to those who have
welcomed it, the suggestion of mass murder is so outrageous and so far from the truth that no
sensible juror could ever be inﬂuenced by it.
It will be necessary, if this trial continues, to prepare a list of questions for the jury, the
precise contents of which will be the subject matter of discussion. As I indicated in
argument, I have reached the tentative view that it will be easier to select a jury if the trial
were to be conducted outside West Yorkshire. Given the proximity to Shefﬁeld and the
extensive coverage of the matters in the Yorkshire newspapers, there is likely to be more
potential jurors in West Yorkshire who will answer the questions in such a way that they
should not be empanelled. In any event, as Presiding Judge, I am well aware of the
difﬁculties faced by the West Yorkshire courts (Leeds and Bradford) in coping with the
volume of criminal cases. Cases, particularly long ones, are often moved out of West
Yorkshire when it is practicable so to do in order to relieve the strain on the system. I am also
aware that none of the courtrooms in Leeds is ideal for a trial of this kind. Ihave also reached
the tentative view that, for these reasons, a trial, if there is to be one, should be conducted in
the Moot Hall at Newcastle. However, counsel indicated that they wished to address me
about that, should I decide not to quash the proceedings.
Ever mindful of the obligation to ensure a fair trial, I have reached the conclusion that the
defendants have failed to prove on the balance of probabilities that the adverse publicity will
prevent or impede a fair trial. I go further. 1 am quite satisﬁed that they will have a fair trial.
If there is to be trial, I shall reconsider the issue if it is necessary to do.
The prosecution is so oppressive, unfair and wrong that it should not be allowed to continue.
An attack was made on the objectivity of the prosecution team and particularly Miss
Adlington. I confess to some reservations about the manner in which the prosecutiOn has
been conducted, for example the decision to start these proceedings in the Liverpool area, Mr

Jones‘ argument at the PDH to the effect that admissions made by the defendants only for the
purposes of the committal proceedings were binding at trial and his argument that I should
admit into evidence an attendance note of a solicitor who was not to be called because the
prosecution did not believe a word he said. A similar argument was raised about Miss
Adlington before Mr Cadbury and was rejected by him. (volume 8, tab 7 pages 100-101) I
see no reason to depart from his ﬁnding nor to stop the proceedings for this reason. I make it
clear, however, that I expect the prosecution to act properly and fairly. I am sure it will. If it
does not I shall not hesitate to act.

It is submitted that the proceedings should he stayed because the prosecution was only
launched alter the McGovern ﬁlm which was a distortion of the truth. The prosecution has
been “prompted by a distorted and misrepresented view of the true facts”. I understood the
description “misrepresented” to refer to matters unconnected with the evidence upon which
the prosecution rely in this case. It is submitted that this prosecution has “become a private
persecution brought against the background of an unprecedented level of media viliﬁcation of
the defendants and a stirring up of emotional passions.” I see no merit in these arguments
provided the defendants can have a fair trial, as I have found they can and provided that the
prosecution is not so oppressive that it ought not be allowed to continue, a matter to which I
return shortly.

It is submitted that, given that the evidence has not changed since 1989-90, the prosecution
should he stayed having regard to the earlier decisions not to prosecute, the verdict of the
Coroner’s jury, the results of the review conducted by Stuart-Smith L} and the endorsement
of the conclusions therein by the Home Secretary and the DPP. It is submitted that there is
here “a refusal to accept earlier decisions”. Similar arguments were put to the DPP and, it
appears, to the Divisional Court in March of last year. Mr Nowell outlined this argument in
paragraph 2(1) of his affidavit where he dealt with factors tending against prosecution. The
position has further changed in favour of the prosecution in that there is now a case to answer.
Against this background, I see no justiﬁcation in quashing the proceedings for this reason,
assuming. without deciding, that this could be a free-standing ground to quash.
It is submitted that a court has a duty to be extra vigilant when a private prosecution is
brought because private prosecutors are nor subject to the same code as public prosecuting
authorities: “the duty of the court to protect defendants from oppression and abuse against a
private prosecutor calls for a different approach” than that followed where public prosecuting
authorities are concerned. Private prosecution “must not be allowed to become an unfettered

No permission, is mentally copy or use in court
indulgence"". It is submitted that this prosecution is so unfair, unreasonable and wrong that it
should not be allowed to proceed. These are similar arguments to those developed in the
Divisional Court, since when, as l have said, there has been found a case to answer. In my
view it would not be right for me to apply the CPS evidentiary test and decide whether there
is a realistic prospect of a conviction. Indeed I was not asked to carry out a detailed
examination of the evidence. Insofar as public interest is concerned, assuming that a private
prosecutor should take that into account, the Divisional Court has already held that the
decision not to intervene is not Wednesbury unreasonable. Subject to the issue of oppression.
I see no reason why I should interfere with the decision to prosecute which, it seems to me, is
also one that a reasonable prosecutor could reach.
it is submitted on the analogy of cases like R. v. Croydon Justices, ex parte Dean (1994) 98
Cr.App.R. 76 that there had been, in effect, an undertaking to the defendants that they would
not be prosecuted. Reliance is placed on what Mr Jones said during the Divisional Court
hearing in 1993 against the background of the CPS decisions not to prosecute. Nothing that
Mr Jones said on behalf of the six families who took those proceedings can be regarded as an
undertaking of the kind referred to in Croydon Justices. This is not a case, on the evidence
before me, where a person has relied upon a promise or undertaking (see Attorney-General
of’l‘rinidad and Tobago [1995] lAC 396 at 417).
1 turn to the question which has given me the most concern: “Is this prosecution so I
oppressive to these defendants that it ought to be stayed?” There was no dispute that an
prosecution could be so oppressive that it should he stayed. In Latif [1996] 2 Cr. App. R. 92,
at 101 (H.L.) Lord Steyn said the law is settled:
“Weighing countervailing considerations of policy and justice, it is for the judge in
the exercise of his discretion to decide whether there has been an abuse of process,
which amounts to an affront to the public conscience and requires the criminal
proceedings to be stayed or where it would be contrary to the public interest in
the integrity of the criminal justice system that a trial should take place. [T]he
judge must weigh in the balance the public interest in ensuring that those that are
charged with grave crimes should be tried and the competing public interest in not
conveying the impression that the court will adopt the approach that the end
justiﬁes any means.”
in Attomey-General's Reference 1N0. l of 19901 (1992) 95 Cr.App.R. 296, at 302-303 Lord
Lane CJ said:
“Stays imposed on the grounds of delay or for any other reason should only be
employed in exceptional circumstances. If they were to become a matter of routine,
it would be only a short time before the public, understandably, viewed the process

That case and the earlier case of Heston-Francois (1984) 78 Cr.App.R. 209 refer to the
alternatives open to a trial judge other than stopping a trial.
In Dept. of Transport v. Chris Smaller Ltd 1989 AC 1197, at 1210 (a civil case) Lord
Grifﬁths said:
“I would, however, express a note of caution against allowing the mere fact of the
anxiety that accompanies any litigation being regarded as of itself a sufﬁcient
prejudice to justify striking out an action. ‘lhere are, however, passages in some
of the judgments that suggest that the mere sword of Damoeles, hanging for an
unnecessary period, might be a sufﬁcient reason of itself to strike out. On this
aspect I repeat the note of caution 1 expressed in the Court of Appeal in Eagii Trust
Co. Ltd. v. Pigntt-Brown [1985] 3 All ER 119, 124, wherel said:
""Any action is bound to cause anxiety, but it would as a general rule be an
exceptional case where that sort of anxiety alone would found a sufﬁcient
ground for striking out in the absence of evidence of any particular
prejudice. Biss’s case is an example of such an exceptional ease, the acti0n
hanging over for 11 years, with professional reputations at stake.""
In the ruling of Buckley J. (unreported, 09/96, C.C.C.) following the acquittal of Kevin
Maxwell and others at the ﬁrst trial can be found the following passage (at page 233-234):
“Finally, an important, though not decisive consideration; fairness to the Defendants.
1 have mentioned the time that these criminal proceedings would have been hanging
over their heads in the event ol'a further trial, at least five years. That would be so, in
Mr. Kevin Maxwell’s case, notwithstanding that in going through the extremely
lengthy trial process he gave evidence before the jury for twenty days and
notwithstanding the acquittals. The disruption to personal and business life is
inevitably considerable. The stress and pain that criminals inflict on their families is a
sad but inevitable consequence of their misdeeds. Courts are mindful of it but
obviously cannot allow it to outweigh consideration for victims and the general public
interest in punishing crime. But I remind myself here that these Defendants have been
acquitted and in the circumstances I have described. As I mentioned earlier Mrs.
Kevin Maxwell gave evidence before me. Her obvious distress was, I am convinced,
entirely genuine. She described the agony of trial and the days waiting for the verdict
with the prospect of a signiﬁcant prison sentence in the balance. She told me of
problems with her children. In particular, their son who had been told by schoolmates
that his father was going to prison for a long time. When ever her husband goes out
she is now repeatedly asked “Will daddy be coming home again?”.
I can understand the expectation that built up in the family”s mind that an acquittal
would be the end of the matter. Mrs. Maxwell’s bewilderment and anger at the
decision to proceed to another trial were not feigned. I cannot be over inﬂuenced by
such matters but no one could have been unmoved by her evidence.”

a reasonable time is designed to prevent a person charged from remaining ""too long in a state
ofuncerminty about his fate"" (Stiigmiiller v. Austria 1 EHRR. 155, at para. 5 at 191).

This is not a case where new evidence has been found many years later (for example DNA
evidence) or where the defendants have misled the prosecuting authorities in some way.
Clearly different principles apply in those kinds ofcases. As I have said before, the evidence
against these defendants is the same evidence as it was in 1989. Even if the test applied in
1990 was not the Adomako test (which I shall assume to be the correct test), that is not in the
same category as the ﬁnding of new evidence. Nor is this a case where the authorities have
acted improperly- the decisions not to prosecute were made in good faith and it has not been
suggested otherwise. Nor is this a case where there has been undue delay caused by the
prosecution following the institution ot‘these proceedings against the defendants.

In this case neither the defendants or members of their family have given evidence, but I have
no difﬁculty in inferring that they must be suffering a considerable amount of strain. They
are likely to have thought following the verdict of the jury in the Coroner‘s enquiry in 1991, if
not earlier, that a prosecution was. at the least, very unlikely, except perhaps during the
continuance of the 1993 Divisional Court proceedings and in the period leading up to and
including the enquiry conducted by Stuart-Smith Ll. In 1998 the defendants, l infer, must
have started suffering the stress which they had suffered during the period 1989-1991. They
have, of course, both resigned from the police force and there is no evidence before me that a
conviction would have any particular ﬁnancial consequence. i add that, on the evidence
before me, they are receiving the best possible legal representation thanks to the South
Yorkshire police.

The thought of being convicted for a serious offence of manslaughter must be a strain on
anybody. However, and 1 can say this from my own experience defending in criminal cases
over many years, it is the thought of prison which, for most defendants, is the greatest worry.
In the words of Buckley 1., Mrs Pandora Maxwell “described the agony of trial and the days
waiting for the verdict with the prospect of a signiﬁcant prisOn sentence in the balance.” That
is familiar to anyone who has defended in serious criminal cases. For police ofﬁcers or ex-
police ofﬁcers, the threat of prison has even more signiﬁcance than for others. These two
defendants, if sentenced to prison for the manslaughter of, in effect, 96 people, would
necessarily be at considerable risk of serious injury if not of death at the hands of those who
feel very strongly about Hillsborough.

On the other side of the balance is the public interest put succinctly by Mr Newell in the 1999
Divisional Court proceedings:
“... there was in my view one extremely important factor in favour of prosecution,
namely the very serious nature of the alleged offences, in particular, the alleged
offences of manslaughter. In my opinion, the allegation that two senior police ofﬁcers
were responsible for the deaths of a number of people as a result of Criminal
negligence was a very grave allegation"".
Doing my best to resolve the competing interests of the defendants and the public, I have
decided that there is an alternative to a stay. I conclude that the oppression is not such as to
prevent the trial from taking place but that I should now reduce to a signiﬁcant extent the
anguish being suffered by these defendants. I do that by making it clear that the tWo
defendants will not immediately lose their liberty should they be convicted. This is, I accept,
a highly unusual course, but this is a highly unusual case. When 1 canvassed this possibility
with Mr Jones, he fairly and helpfully drew my attention to evidence that the families were
not. apparently, seeking punishment of this kind (page 6 of transcript of evidence of Miss
Adlington before the Stipendiary Magistrate).
The prosecution is a breach of the defendants’ rights to a fair trial under Article 6;] )} foﬂfﬂ
E_ur_opean Convention on Human Rights.
Mr Clegg submits that even if, applying the English law of abuse of process, there should be
no stay, I should nonetheless stay the proceedings. To order the trial to continue would be, he
submits, a breach of Article 6(1) of the ECHR. He relies on the words in that Article: “In the
determination of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public
hearing within a reasonable time“. Contrary to the submissions of Mr Jones, he submits that
time started to run when the defendants were interviewad under caution in 1990, that it did
not thereafter cease to run and that a determination of the charges at the earliest in June would
not be within a reasonable time. He further submits that I should anticipate the coming into
force of section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act which provides that: “It is unlawful for a
public authority [which includes a court] to act in a way which is incompatible with 3
Convention right"". Alternatively, I should adjourn the trial until October when it is
anticipated that the Act will come into force.
He accepts, on the authority of R. v D.P.P. ex parte Kebilene [1990] 3 W.L.R. 972 (H.L.)
that it would be contrary to the legislative intention to treat section 6(1) as though it was now
in force. He points to passages in the speeches in that case (9841-1-985A, 996F~H). Relying

upon them, he submits that, if there is a clear breach of section 6(1), a decision should be
taken at this stage rather than on appeal following a conviction. 1 shall assume the
correctness of this submission.
In myjudgmerrt the position is far from clear. I was referred to a large number of authorities
which deal with when time starts to run. They, in very large measure, concern the very
different system of criminal investigation followed on the continent. It is far from clear
whether time would start to run at the moment of arrest or charge in this country or from the
moment of an interview under caution. In this case there is the added difﬁculty that this is a
private prosecution, a type of prosecution unknown, I believe, on the continent. Although I
am inclined to think that time would not cease to run, that is certainly not clear. Mr Jones
strenuously argued that, even if time had started to run in 1990 and continued to run, the
determination would still be within a reasonable time. My inclination would be that the
determination would not be within a reasonable time but is not clear how that should be
determined in a case of this kind.
Amongst the many cases to which I was referred is Eckle v. Federal Republic of Germany
(1982) 5 EHRR. 1. In that case the Court said (at page 25) that a German court had
available a means of affording reparation for a breach of the reasonable time requirement in
Article 6(1): “according to well-established case law in the Federal Court of Justice, when
determining sentence the judge must take proper account of any over-stepping of the
‘reasonabie time’ within the meaning of Article 6(1)”. Mr Jones relied on this case and on
section 8 of the Act which provides that, in relation to any act which the court ﬁnds is
unlawful, “it may grant such relief as it considers just and appropriate.” Mr Clegg
submitted that section 6(1) of the Act prevented the approach in M- if the reasonable time
had expired there was only one remedy available, namely stay the proceedings. He submitted
that the court had no discretion in the matter. ""1er balancing approach developed in the
English courts could not be adopted. If all else were clear, this certainly is not. This alone
prevents this case from falling into the category of clear cases referred to in Kebilene.
Should I then grant an adjournment until October, when it is anticipated that the Act will
come into force? The trial date was set in September of last year, with the consent of all
concerned. lt would not be right now to adjourn it. Should either of the defendants be
convicted, the arguments raised by Mr Clcgg can he raised again in the Court of Appeal and
the chronology which I have set out coupled with the written evidence of Miss Adlington and
her oral evidence before the Stipendiary Magistrate, should enable the appellate court to

Sentencing remarks of Mr Justice Fulford 


R 


-v-


Tony McCluskie 


I have no doubt you killed your sister because she was furious with you for letting the 

sink overflow in the bathroom of your mother’s flat on 1 March 2012, against a 

background of the longstanding family relationships. I accept that Gemma expressed 

anger at you early that morning and warned you that if you did not treat your mother’s 

home with more respect in the future, you may have to leave, but that said I 
 

unhesitatingly reject your account, as given by you in evidence in this trial, that she had 

used significant foul language towards you, or that she had belittled or threatened you, in 

the past. Your accounts to the police in early March contain none of the matters you 

were later to allege against her, and I consider the way you described your relationship in 

the significant interview on 6 March and in your witness statement is determinative of 

this issue. Gemma was, on the compelling descriptions the jury heard during this trial, a 

young woman with a huge zest for life; she was a warm-hearted woman who was loved
--------
dearly by a great many people. She will be greatly missed. Your sister may well have been 

fiery on occasion and no doubt expressed herself forcefully but in my view she did not in 

any sense do anything that even begins to justify what you did to her.  

 

I accept that this was a particularly challenging period in your life: things were not going 

well between you and your partner, Teri Arnull; your mother had been desperately unwell 
 

for a significant period of time; there was talk of redundancies at work; you were 

hopelessly addicted to the powerful type of cannabis known colloquially as “skunk”; and 

you were living a significantly withdrawn existence – spending most of your time when 

not at work in your room – in the same house as your hugely popular and outgoing 

sister. 

 

That said, instead of exercising a normal degree of fortitude and resilience, you followed 

your emotions and battered your sister at least twice on the head, sufficiently hard to 

depress her skull. Although the prosecution put the case against you on the basis that you 

may only have intended to inflict really serious bodily harm, given the severity of the 

injuries to GM’s head I am of the view that the difference between that and intending to 

kill her is not as great as it is in other cases. These were very bad injuries at one of the 

body’s most vulnerable sites. You must have used a hard, flat surfaced weapon in order 

to kill GM, within her own home. 

 

This crime, extremely grave when viewed in isolation, was significantly aggravated by 

your actions afterwards. Over a large number of hours you set about, in an utterly cold-

blooded and determined way, to try to hide what you had done and, moreover, you 

sought to point the finger of blame at others. You dismembered Gemma, cutting off all 

her limbs and her head, and having first tried and failed to do this with a knife, you must
--------
have left the flat to buy an implement similar to a meat cleaver, which has never been 

found. You then went to the Regents Canal at least twice (once by taxi) in order to 

dispose of her remains. Your hope must have been that she would never be found and 

you diverted, and attempted to influence, the police investigation by controlling the 

release of information and by giving information about one or more individuals who you 
 

knew were wholly innocent, such the individual with the initials BM. You concealed a 

number of items, including most particularly her mobile telephone. 

 

I note additionally that in this trial you have made a sustained attempt to destroy at least 

part of the reputation of your sister, and the effect Gemma’s death has had on your 

family, and perhaps most particularly your mother, has been profound. As the letters I 

have read make clear, the laughter and enjoyment in life for them has simply gone. 

 

In your favour is your good character save for the three cannabis matters; your record of 

continuous employment; the lack of any significant premeditation; and (to a limited 

extent only for the reasons I have already expressed) that you may not have intended to 

kill her. Additionally, there were no previous indications that you harboured violent 

intentions towards your sister.  

 

The starting point for the period you must serve before parole in your case can even be 

considered is 15 years. 

 

Having considered the authorities that have been brought to my attention and bearing in 

mind the facts I have rehearsed, together with the aggravating and mitigating factors, and 

particularly the appalling way you acted after the murder, the minimum term will be 20 

years imprisonment. Once that period has passed, it will be for the parole board to
--------
determine whether you are to be released, and if so, when. Deduction of time served to

CHRISTOPHER JOHN HALLIWELL 


 
RULING ON PRELIMINARY ISSUES: ABUSE OF PROCESS
 

Introduction 
 

1. 	

This defendant was originally charged on two counts of murder in an 

indictment before Bristol Crown Court.  Before he was arraigned the 

Court heard two applications made on his behalf. 

2. 	

First, there was an application to exclude the evidence contained in the 

witness statement of the Senior Investigating Officer (SIO) Detective 

Superintendent Fulcher, together with associated evidence said to be 

tainted by the activities of that officer.  This evidence related to the 

period from the moment of the defendant’s removal from his place of 

arrest, at 11:06am on 24 March 2011, until his arrival at the police 

station four hours later at 15:15 hours.  The basis of this application 

was that the documents revealed such substantial and irretrievable 

 
breaches of PACE and the applicable Codes that the evidence was 

rendered inadmissible.
--------
3. 

On 4 February 2012, after a four-day hearing on a voire dire and for the 

reasons subsequently sent to the parties in writing, I granted that 

application.  In respect of Count 2 on the indictment, charging the 

defendant with the murder of Becky Godden-Edwards, that amounted 

to a terminating ruling.  The Crown did not appeal. 

4. 	

There was then a further application for the trial on this indictment to be 

stayed as an abuse of the process.  In summary, the basis for this 

application was that, after the defendant’s arrest, the SIO had called a 

series of press conferences and briefed the press in detail on what the 

defendant had told the police and how he had led them to separate 

locations where two bodies could be found.  There was then extensive 

and repeated national media coverage of the case and of these facts in 

particular, over a number of weeks, such that it is no longer possible to 

rectify the damage caused by this publicity and the defendant could not 

have a fair trial. 

5. 	

I heard some preliminary submissions on this matter immediately after 

my ruling on the first; and I subsequently gave directions for the 

hearing.  I heard full argument on 4 April 2012 and reserved judgment 

in order to consider the substantial volume of documentation submitted 

by the defendant, based on the media coverage of this case. 

6. 	

At a hearing on 9 May 2012 I dismissed the application and agreed to 

send full reasons to the parties in writing.  These are the reasons for my 

decision on that application.
--------
7. 	

Subsequently, at the PCMH held at Preston Crown Court on 31 May, 

the Defence applied to dismiss Count 2, the Crown did not resist the 

applications and Count 2 was deleted from the indictment.  The 

defendant was arraigned on Count 1 and pleaded not guilty.  His trial 

on that Count is now fixed to be heard at Preston, the case having now 

been transferred from Bristol Crown Court, commencing on 25 

February 2013, with a provisional time estimate of two weeks.  The 

case will be listed for further case management directions after the 

parties have had an opportunity to consider these written reasons and it 

was agreed that no Defence Statement need be served until then. 

8. 	

For convenience, because the two applications are linked and the SIO 

gave evidence at the voire dire which is relevant to the second 

application, I am attaching as an Appendix to these reasons the first 

ruling on admissibility, so that the issues on the second application and 

the context in which they arise may be properly understood. 

9. 	

The background facts are set out in full in that first ruling, which may 

helpfully be read first, and I do not therefore repeat them here. 

 
ABUSE OF PROCESS 

 
The Relevant Facts 

10. 	

In his evidence at the voire dire DSupt Fulcher described the media 

strategy adopted from the start of Operation Mayan.  The strategy
--------
incorporated public engagement, regular liaison with the media and the 

use of posters and flyers and an on-line social media response.   

11. 	 Before the defendant’s arrest on 24 March 2011, DSupt Fulcher 

approved media releases each day between 19 and 24 March, 

appealing for witnesses and providing or updating information to 

members of the public about Sian and about the searches being carried 

out.  He held a press conference on 21 March, widely attended by TV, 

 
radio and print media personnel. 

12. 	 This decision to engage the media became an important element of the 

tactics adopted by the police to try and encourage the defendant to 

return, under surveillance, to wherever Sian had been taken.  The 

strategy resulted both in an unprecedented response from members of 

the public, many thousands helping in the search, and a substantial 

amount of media attention.  By the time of the defendant’s arrest, 

although the plan to encourage him to return to Sian’s location had not 

worked, the circumstances of Sian’s disappearance and the hunt to find 

her had attracted considerable publicity, both online and in the local 

and national print media. 

13. 	 After his arrest and the events which led to the first application to 

exclude the evidence relating to them, the defendant was then returned 

to the police station.  He was immediately allowed access to a solicitor 

who attended and was present at the interviews, all of which were 

conducted under caution.  DSupt Fulcher provided for the solicitor, by
--------
way of partial disclosure, a summary of the earlier interviews he had 

carried out with the defendant. 

14. 	 On legal advice the defendant exercised his right to make no comment 

in answer to all the questions asked of him.  DSupt Fulcher said in 

evidence that it had not occurred to him, after all the defendant had 

 
said to him earlier, that he would now “refuse to offer any further 

comment”. 

15. 	 At the very end of the earlier interviews, before the defendant was 

returned to the police station, the defendant had said that he did not 

want to repeat to others what he had told DSupt Fulcher.  He was told 

that he would have to, but the defendant expressed concerns about the 

affects of all this on his children.  DSupt Fulcher said that he would 

make arrangements to move his family out of the area, so that they 

might avoid the harmful effects of publicity concerning the case.  Such 

arrangements were indeed made and implemented.  However, the 

defendant stayed silent in interview and, much to the officer’s 

annoyance I have no doubt, did not repeat in interview under caution 

the matters he had earlier relayed to him. 

16. 	

In his witness statement, adopted as his evidence in chief at the voire 

dire, DSupt Fulcher said that he was aware that members of the public 

had videoed the defendant’s arrest in the car park on their mobile 

phones and had rapidly posted the footage on to social media sites.  

Various media outlets were seeking clarification as to who had been
--------
arrested and why.  A holding statement was issued whilst he was on his 

own with the defendant and before returning him to the police station.   

17. 	 At 17:00 hours on the evening of the defendant’s arrest, 24 March, 

DSupt Fulcher conducted a televised press conference, the contents of 

which he said had been sanctioned by the Gold Group.  By that time 

the police had found what they believed to be Sian’s body.  In his 

evidence in chief DSupt Fulcher stated that he told the press that a 47 

year old man from Swindon was in custody, having been arrested on 

suspicion of kidnap and two murders; and that he had been taken to the 

location of two bodies, neither of which had been identified, but one of 

which was believed to be that of Sian.   

18. 	

In cross-examination relating to this press conference and further 

conferences which took place over the following days, DSupt Fulcher 

made a number of frank admissions.  He accepted that he had told the 

press at this press conference not only that a 47 year old man had 

been arrested, but also that it was that man who had led him to one 

body and to the location of another, thereby informing them as to what 

the man under arrest had told him. 

19. 	 He admitted that he had just assumed the defendant would continue to 

talk to the interviewing officers and tell them what he had earlier told 

him, so that the details would all be subsumed within the interviews 

under caution.  He expressed surprise that the defendant was advised 

to make no comment and expressed the view that the defendant would
--------
have been best advised to explain the circumstances and to mitigate.  

He accepted that he was both annoyed and frustrated by the 

defendant’s silence in interview.  He expressed the view that he had 

received “foolish legal advice”.   

20. 	 Further, although he expressed the view that the public had a right to 

know what the police had been doing, he admitted when cross-

examined that at the time he had not thought through the implications 

of giving the media all that information.  Whilst he had not expressly 

revealed the identity of the arrested man he accepted that, by the 

evening of 24 March, the media had worked it out for themselves, given 

the circumstances of the defendant’s arrest in a busy car park, in the 

presence of members of the public, and the pictures taken of that arrest 

being posted on YouTube within a very short time.  Certainly, the 

defendant was named in the media as the man under arrest almost 

immediately. 

21. 	 DSupt Fulcher provided details of the further press briefings.  At 10:30 

hours on Friday 25 March he held another press conference, the 

contents of which were once again defined and sanctioned by the Gold 

Group.  His explanation was that there had been huge media interest, 

with some inaccurate reporting, and he considered it essential to allay 

public disquiet by providing sufficient detail of what had occurred and 

what the police knew at that point in time.  He therefore explained his 

knowledge of Sian’s abduction and outlined in broad terms the 

investigative approach that he had taken.  Once again he included in
--------
this briefing the fact that the man who had been arrested had taken him 

to two separate locations where bodies were to be found.  DSupt 

Fulcher said that he had very little information about the second victim 

at that stage.  He stated,  “it was incumbent on me to address 

 

legitimate public concerns”.   

22. 	 On Saturday 26 March, the officer held a further, televised press 

conference at 15:00 hours, providing a formal briefing agreed once 

more through the Gold Group for media release, in which he included 

details of what the defendant had told him regarding the second body. 

He stated that he did this because media speculation based on 

coverage without this clarification had resulted in more than 600 calls to 

the major incident room from concerned relatives of missing people.  

He stated that he considered it entirely appropriate for him to provide 

such clarity as he could to allay people’s fears and minimise their false 

hopes. 

23. 	 On Sunday 27 March the defendant was charged with the murder of 

Sian O’Callaghan.  At 10:42 on that day DSupt Fulcher sanctioned a 

joint media release from the Crown Prosecution Service and Wiltshire 

Police stating that the defendant had been charged with Sian’s murder.  

At 12:46 hours that day he released information concerning the 

estimated age of the second person whose body had been found.  He 

also repeated the information given to him by the defendant,  that the 

victim was a young woman taken from the Swindon area between 2003 

and 2005.  He gave his reason for doing so as wanting to provide
--------
accurate information to potentially bereaved parties and to enable 

witnesses to recognise that they may have relevant information. 

24. 	 Applications to extend the period of the defendant’s detention had been 

made at the Magistrates’ Court on 25 and 26 March.  On 26 March no 

members of the press were present at the hearing, at which the 

defendant was legally represented.  DSupt Fulcher admitted that, when 

he gave evidence, he stated that the defendant’s failure to answer 

questions in interview meant that the police could not progress the 

investigation.  He also referred to his agreement to move the 

defendant’s partner and children out of the area to avoid media 

attention.  He accepted that he had suggested that the defendant’s 

failure to answer questions was the result of the solicitor’s involvement 

in the case and that he considered that the solicitor’s advice was 

frustrating the investigation. 

25. 	 Mr Latham suggested that he was deliberately trying to influence the 

defendant from the witness box and to undermine the legal advice he 

was receiving.  The officer stated that he had said this out of sheer 

frustration at what was happening.  Having heard all the evidence I 

accept that explanation.  I reject the suggestion of a more sinister 

   
motive for his conduct. 

26. 	 Nine days later, on 5 April, the officer conducted a further press 

conference, the contents of which were once again sanctioned by the 

head of Corporate Communications and the Gold Group, and which
--------
related to the identity of the second victim and her background. 

27. 	

In the week following this press conference media releases consisted of 

information relating to Sian’s funeral and a repetition of information 

concerning Sian and the other victim Becky Godden-Edwards.  An 

entry in the Incident Policy Book for 9 April acknowledged that, since 

the defendant had been charged with the murder of Sian O’Callaghan, 

the “matter is sub judice”. 

28. 	 On 23 May 2011, DSupt Fulcher sanctioned a final media release, 

indicating that the defendant had been charged that day with the 

murder of Ms Godden-Edwards. 

29. 	

In addition to the oral evidence of DSupt Fulcher, and before the 

hearing of this application on 4 April 2012, the defendant’s 

representatives analysed in considerable detail the contents of the 

police press releases and conferences, and of the publicity given to 

them, in order to reveal the extent of the factual information which had 

been provided to the media and placed in the public arena after the 

defendant’s arrest.  This was produced as a list of bullet points and a 

detailed schedule of printed material, identifying the date of each item 

of information, the relevant newspaper and the source of the 

information.  The schedule covered a period between 21 March and 25 

April 2011 and the list ran from 19 March - 23 May 2011. 

30. 	 For the majority of this information the source was shown to be DSupt
--------
Fulcher.  In some cases, on 26 and 28 March, the source is identified 

only as a “police source” or, more often, just “a source”.  Mr Latham’s 

submission, and there really is no dispute about it, is that most of the 

material is referred to as fact and all of it must have come from the 

police, most probably from DSupt Fulcher. 

31. 

In The Mirror on Sunday for 27 March the following statement 

appeared, provided by the Crown Prosecution Service: 

“Simon Brenchley, District Crown Prosecutor for the CPS in 
Wiltshire, said: I have been working closely with Wiltshire Police 
and have now authorised them to charge Christopher Halliwell with 
Sian O’Callaghan’s murder.  I must remind the media to take care 
in reporting events surrounding this case.  Mr Halliwell has been 
charged with a serious offence and is entitled to a fair trial.  It is 
extremely important that nothing should be reported which could 
prejudice a fair trial.  I will keep liaising closely with the police as 
their investigation continues.” 

32. 

I have considered all this material carefully, together with the original 

copy newspapers submitted for me to read.  The bullet point list of facts 

provided to the press after the defendant’s arrest is not in dispute and is 

 
as follows: 

“•	  Halliwell had taken the police to the two bodies 

     

•  He had admitted killing the two women

The Defence Submissions 

33. 	 Mr Latham submits that what happened here constitutes an abuse of 

process in two respects.  There was, he submits, an assault on the
--------
integrity of the criminal justice system as a result of the deliberate 

misconduct of the police in briefing the media on what the arrested man 

had told them.  That alone merits a stay of the proceedings.  Further, 

the nature and extent of what was done also means that it is now 

impossible for this defendant to have a fair trial. 

34. 	 He submits that the evidence in this case demonstrates bad faith, or at 

best “serious fault” by the Police and the Crown Prosecution Service.  

What may have begun with a degree of innocence is said to have 

developed into conduct amounting to bad faith over the course of 24 

hours following the defendant’s arrest; and it resulted in a striking 

contempt of the rules relating to sub judice material. 

35. 	 Even if the Court were not satisfied as to bad faith, there was clearly 

serious and continuing fault here.  For the reasons given in the ruling 

on admissibility there were also found to have been wholesale and 

irretrievable breaches of PACE and the Codes, together with the 

 
possibility of oppression, in circumstances deliberately designed by 

DSupt Fulcher to persuade this defendant to speak when he did not 

wish to; and to ensure that the protections to which he was entitled in 

law were not afforded to him. 

36. 	 This misconduct was then followed by a cynical and deliberate policy of 

“drip-feeding” to the national media, from the first press conference on 

24 March to the identity of the second body some days later, a whole 

series of sub judice facts arising from the police investigation, many of
--------
which cannot now be given in evidence at trial, as a result of the first 

ruling, and which the public had no right to know.  The SIO knew the 

restrictions and his professional obligation and yet he deliberately broke 

the rules.  Only after strenuous objections about the reporting were 

made by the Defence did the Crown Prosecution Service issue 

statements to the press urging restraint, to prevent prejudicial publicity.  

This, however, came far too late. 

37. 	 After the defendant’s arrest Mr Latham submits that the shutters should 

have come down.  Instead, in a series of announcements to the media, 

 
scripted in advance, DSupt Fulcher deliberately placed in the public 

arena information now ruled inadmissible and when the matter was sub 

judice.  This was wholly improper and unjustified conduct by a senior 

officer which is, in Mr Latham’s submission, without precedent.   

38. 	 Drawing a distinction between what happened here and justifiable 

appeals for public assistance and the supply of information in anodyne 

terms as to a man’s arrest and the recovery of a body, to which there 

can be no objection, Mr Latham submitted that DSupt Fulcher 

deliberately briefed the media on evidence that made out the case 

against this defendant.  The media were given specific information on 

which the police were intending to rely as part of the Prosecution case.   

39. 	 He emphasises that the problem here has been created by the 

Prosecution, not by the media.  This is not a case involving inaccurate, 

speculative or misleading reporting or ill-informed and extravagant
--------
comment by the media, which can be addressed by appropriate judicial 

direction in strong terms.  On the contrary, the media published what 
 

was almost entirely the truth, that is the actual facts of what had 

happened and their evidential linkage to the defendant.  They were 

given these facts by the SIO personally. 

40. 	

In relation to the nature of the publicity that resulted, Mr Latham 

submitted that this was a notorious investigation, both because of the 

storyline itself, involving the abduction of an attractive young girl, and 

the fact that the police had already actively engaged the media, in an 

attempt to progress the investigation, obtain assistance from the public 

and “flush out” the suspect. 

41. 	 There was therefore “saturation coverage” of this case and, by the time 

of the first press conference on 24 March, the public were waiting 

eagerly for the next thing to happen.  The story, as Mr Latham 

expressed it, “went viral”.  Much of the newspaper coverage, both in the 

tabloids and the broadsheets, was either on the front page or just inside 

that page. 

42. 	 Mr Latham spent some time analysing various aspects of the publicity 

in support of these submissions.  He noted that reports of the case had 

appeared not only in local and national newspapers, but also in other, 

regional publications, for example, the Northumberland daily paper 

“The Journal” on 25 March (at page 14) and the Newcastle Evening 

Chronicle for 26 March (page 8).  In addition there was ample TV
--------
coverage.  It is not in dispute that much of the online material can still 

readily be discovered on the various network sites, including the filmed 

press conference given by DSupt Fulcher on 24 March. 

43. 	 As a result of this extensive and graphic coverage, Mr Latham submits 

that its harmful effects cannot now be rectified by the trial process.  He 

submits that there is no chance that at least one juror will not recall the 

graphic publicity and the fact that this defendant had led the police to 

separate locations, where two bodies were to be found, and had 

admitted two killings, which were both intertwined.  Inevitably they will 

recall the basic facts, even if they no longer recognise the name of the 

defendant or of the victim.  It is therefore inevitable that they will recall 

facts which have now been ruled inadmissible.  There is in this way a 

real risk, which cannot be removed, that at least one juror would be 

contaminated by this prejudicial publicity and that the juror would tell 

the others.  The overwhelming prejudice to the defendant is such that 

no judicial direction could remedy the unfairness that has been caused 

and ensure that he can have a fair trial.  The trial should therefore be 

stayed. 

 
The Law 

44. 	 The applicable legal principles are not in dispute and they have been 

considered and applied on a number of occasions in recent years.  My 

attention was drawn to the passages in Archbold: Criminal Pleading, 

Evidence and Practice (12th edition), paragraphs 4-87 onwards, in
--------
relation to situations where a stay may be considered necessary to 

protect the integrity of the criminal justice system, and to the various 

examples there set out, fairness to the accused being subsumed in that 

primary consideration in such cases (see Warren v Att.-Gen. of 

Jersey [2011] 3 WLR 464). 

 

45. 	 The question is whether that test is met on the evidence in this case.  

For a stay to be imposed there must be a connection between the 

wrongdoing and the trial, such that not only the wrongdoing but also the 

trial would be an affront to the public conscience (R v Ahmed and 

Ahmed [2011] Crim LR 734 CA).  The court has to strike a balance 

 

between the public interest in ensuring that those who are accused of 

serious crimes should be tried and the competing public interest in 

ensuring that executive misconduct does not undermine public 

confidence in the criminal justice system and bring it into disrepute (see 

Warren). 

  

46. 	

In relation to adverse publicity and its effect upon the prospects for a 

fair trial, while it is correct that no authority has addressed the particular 

facts arising in this case, the principles established in the cases are 

clear and long-standing, and they are plainly of general application.   

47. 	 The earlier authorities relating to pre-trial publicity and its effects upon 

the fairness of a trial were comprehensively considered by the Court of 

Appeal Criminal Division in R v Stone [2001] EWCA Crim 297.  In R v 

Kray [1969] 53 Cr App R 412, the issue was the extent to which
--------
publicity relating to the appellant’s conviction of murder in an earlier trial 

would influence jurors’ minds and unfairly prejudice the appellant in a 

second trial on another charge of murder. 

48.  Acknowledging the presumption that anyone who may have read the 

publicity might find it difficult to reach a verdict in a fair-minded way, 

Kennedy LJ, giving the judgment of the Court in Stone, said as follows 

at page 415: 

“It is, however, a matter of human experience, and certainly a matter of 
the experience of those who practise in the criminal courts, first, that the 
public’s recollection is short, and, secondly, that the drama, if I may use 
that term, of a trial almost always has the effect of excluding from 
recollection that which went before.” 
 

He went on to observe: 

“… to a very large extent juries are trusted by our system to concentrate 
 
on what is relevant and to ignore irrelevant and prejudicial matters even 
when they know of them.” 

 

49. 

In R v Central Criminal Court ex parte The Telegraph PLC and 

Others [1994] 98 Cr App R 91, the Court had applied this reasoning, 

Lord Taylor CJ stating as follows at page 98: 

 

“In determining whether publication of a matter would cause a substantial 
risk of prejudice to a future trial, a court should credit the jury with the will 
and ability to abide by the judge’s direction to decide the case only on the 
evidence before them.  The court should also bear in mind that the 
staying power and detail of publicity, even in cases of notoriety, are 
limited and that the nature of the trial is to focus the jury’s mind on the 
evidence put before them rather than on matters outside the courtroom: 
 
see Kray …” 

50.  As Kennedy LJ observed, the question for judgment in each case is
--------
whether the particular facts mean that the line has been crossed and a 

fair trial is no longer possible, so that the proceedings should be stayed. 

In deciding that question he said that the Judge should bear in mind, as 

Scott Baker J said in Ex parte B, 17 February 1994 (unreported) that: 

“In most cases, one day’s headline news is the next day’s firelighter.  
Most members of the public do not remember in any detail what they 
have seen on television, heard on the radio or read in the newspaper 
 
except for a very short period of time.” 

51.  The same point was made by the Divisional Court in the case of 

Attorney General v ITN and Others [1995] 1 Cr App R 204, where 

Leggatt LJ said: 

“During the nine months that passed after anyone had read the offending 
 
articles, the likelihood is that he no longer would remember it sufficiently 
to prejudice the trial.  When the long odds against the potential juror 
reading any of the publications is multiplied by the long odds against any 
reader remembering it, the risk of prejudice is, in my judgment, remote.” 
 

52.  At paragraphs 47 – 50 Kennedy LJ endorsed the approach taken by 

Phillips J (as he then was) in considering the adverse publicity which 

had been accorded to Kevin and Ian Maxwell before they appeared for 

trial, as follows: 

“ ‘No stay should be imposed unless the defendant shows on the 
balance of probabilities that owing to the extent and the nature of 
the pre-trial publicity he will suffer serious prejudice to the extent 
that no fair trial can be held.  I would accept this test, so far as it 
goes, but it remains necessary to identity the essential aspects of a 
fair trial for the purpose of the test.  If it were enough to render a 
trial unfair that publicity has created the risk of prejudice against the 
defendant our system of criminal justice would be seriously flawed.  
There will inevitably be cases where the facts are so dramatic that 
almost everyone in the land will know of them.  There will be 
 
circumstances when arrests are made of defendants whose guilt 
will, or may, appear likely.  Intense media coverage may well take
--------
place before a suspect is identified or apprehended.  If in the most 
notorious cases defendants were to claim immunity from trial 
because of the risk of prejudice public confidence in the criminal 
 
justice system would be destroyed.’ 

48.  After referring to two authorities the judge continued -  

‘Our system of criminal justice is founded on the belief that the jury 
trial provides the fairest and most reliable method of determining 
whether guilt is established.  This belief is based on the premise 
that the jury will do their best to be true to their oath and to try the 
case according to the evidence.  The ability of the jury to disregard 
extrinsic material has been repeatedly emphasised by judges of 
great experience.’ 

 
49.  Phillips J then cited from Kray and concluded – 

‘It seems to me that the court will only be justified in staying a trial 
on the ground of adverse pre-trial publicity if satisfied on a balance 
of probabilities that if the jury return a verdict of guilty the effect of 
the pre-trial publicity will be such as to render that verdict unsafe 
and unsatisfactory.  In considering this question the court has to 
consider the likely length of time the jury will be subject to the trial 
process, the issues that are likely to arise and the evidence that is 
likely to be called in order to form a view as to whether it is probable 
 
that – try as they may to disregard the pre-trial publicity – the jury’s 
verdict will be rendered unsafe on account of it.’ 
 

50.  That seems to us to be a valuable approach, …” 

53.  Deciding, after this detailed review, that the Court was satisfied on the 

balance of probabilities that the effect of pre-trial publicity in Stone’s 

case, between October 1998 and February 2001, would not render 

unsafe a guilty verdict delivered in September or October 2001, 

Kennedy LJ said as follows at paragraph 62: 

“The re-trial will not start until nearly three years after the October 1998 
publicity, which is the principal target of complaint, and people do forget. 
 
Even if they do not forget entirely, the passage of time makes it easier for 
them to set aside that which they are told to disregard. …
--------
The risk of prejudice will be reduced if the trial does not take place in 
Kent, or even in London, because the impact of these crimes was at its 
greatest locally and it may be that some further safeguard can be 
provided by a few careful questions to the jury panel ….. But whether or 
not questions are asked we are not now satisfied that if the jury does 
convict their verdict will be found by this court to be unsafe by reason of 
the publicity to which we have referred.” 

54.  The Court of Appeal Criminal Division considered the issue again in R v 

Abu Hamza [2006] EWCA Crim 2918, where the then Lord Chief 

Justice referred to applications for a stay of proceedings on the ground 

of abuse of process being a “growth area in our criminal process” and 

stated that in general the Courts have not been prepared to accede to 

submissions that publicity before a trial has made a fair trial impossible. 

55.  At paragraph 91 he endorsed the statement of the President of the 

Queen’s Bench Division in the case of In re Barot [2006] EWCA Crim 

2692, that: 

“There is a feature of our trial system which is sometimes overlooked or 
taken for granted.  The collective experience of this constitution as well 
as the previous constitution of the court, both when we were in practice at 
the Bar and judicially, has demonstrated to us time and time again, that 
juries up and down the country have a passionate and profound belief in, 
and a commitment to, the right of a defendant to be given a fair trial.  
They know that it is integral to their responsibility.  It is, when all is said 
and done, their birthright; it is shared by each one of them with the 
defendant.  They guard it faithfully.  The integrity of the jury is an 
essential feature of our trial process.  Juries follow the directions which 
the judge will give them to focus exclusively on the evidence and to 
ignore anything they may have heard or read out of court.  No doubt in 
this case Butterfield J will give appropriate directions, tailor-made to the 
individual facts in the light of any trial post the sentencing hearing, after 
hearing submissions from counsel for the defendants.  We cannot too 
strongly emphasise that the jury will follow them, not only because they 
will loyally abide by the directions of law which they will be given by the 
judge, but also because the directions themselves will appeal directly to 
their own instinctive and fundamental belief in the need for the trial 
process to be fair.”
--------
56.  Observing that the position is the same in Scotland, the Lord Chief 

Justice noted the remarks of Lord Hope of Craighead, in the Privy 

Council’s decision in Montgomery v HM Advocate [2003] 1 AC 641, 

that Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights did not set 

out to make it impracticable to bring those accused of crime to 

judgment.  The Strasbourg Court did not require the issue of objective 

impartiality to be resolved with mathematical accuracy.  Account was 

taken of the fact that certainty in these matters was not achievable.  

Lord Hope went on to observe: 

“Recent research conducted for the New Zealand Law Commission 
suggests that the impact of pre-trial publicity and of prejudicial media 
coverage during the trial, even in high profile cases, is minimal: Young, 
Cameron & Tinsley, Juries in Criminal Trials: part Two, vol 1, ch 9, para 
287 (New Zealand Law Commission preliminary paper no 37, November 
1999).  The lapse of time since the last exposure may increasingly be 
regarded, with each month that passes, in itself as some kind of a 
safeguard.  Nevertheless the risk that the widespread, prolonged and 
prejudicial publicity that occurred in this case will have a residual effect 
on the minds of at least some members of the jury cannot be regarded as 
negligible.  The principal safeguards of the objective impartiality of the 
tribunal lie in the trial process itself and the conduct of the trial by the trial 
judge.  On the one hand there is the discipline to which the jury will be 
subjected of listening to and thinking about the evidence.  The actions of 
seeing and hearing the witnesses may be expected to have a far greater 
impact on their minds than such residual recollections as may exist about 
reports about the case in the media.  This impact can be expected to be 
reinforced on the other hand by such warnings and directions as the trial 
judge may think it appropriate to give them as the trial proceeds, in 
particular when he delivers his charge before they retire to consider their 
 
verdicts. 

 

…  the entire system of trial by jury is based upon the assumption that 
the jury will follow the instructions which they receive from the trial judge 
and that they will return a true verdict in accordance with the evidence.” 

57.  Acknowledging that the risk that members of a jury may be affected by 

prejudice is one that cannot wholly be eliminated, the Lord Chief Justice 

continued, at paragraph 93:
--------
“The fact, however, that adverse publicity may have risked prejudicing a 
fair trial is no reason for not proceeding with the trial if the judge 
 
concludes that, with his assistance, it will be possible to have a fair trial. 
In considering this question it is right for the judge to have regard to his 
own experience and that of his fellow judges as to the manner in which 
juries normally perform their duties.” 
 

58.  More recently the present Lord Chief Justice gave the judgment of the 

Court in R v Dobson [2011] EWCA Crim 1255.  Noting that the 

“Stephen Lawrence” case had attracted an unusually high level of 

publicity, he noted that news “spikes” had continued since the collapse 

of the original prosecution in April 1996.  At paragraphs 84 – 86 he 

identified the issue and the Court’s approach as follows: 
 

“84  The issue is stark.  The question is not whether the publicity over the 
years was wise or ill-advised, but whether now, or at the date when the 
 
new trial, if ordered, would take place, the impact of that publicity would 
make a fair trial unlikely.  Mr Roberts submitted that the effect of the 
publicity would be to prejudice any future juror, perhaps without the juror 
in question even appreciating that he or she had unconscious prejudice 
 
against any of the original suspects.  The effect would be insurmountable.  
Mr Mark Ellison QC for whose equally careful submissions we are no less 
indebted, accepted that over the years there had been publicity for the 
case which was potentially prejudicial to the suspects, but he argued that 
the difficulties identified by Mr Roberts could and would be dispelled by 
appropriate judicial direction, in a trial in which the emotional aspects of 
the case would quickly give way to the practical reality that the jury would 
have to concentrate on the new scientific findings, the circumstances in 
 
which they were made, and the weight to be attached to them in the light 
 
of the defence case that post-incident contamination could not be 
excluded. 

85  If Mr Roberts is right, whatever new evidence may emerge, however 
powerful it may be, neither of the two original suspects who have not 
faced trial could ever face trial, nor could any of the three original 
suspects who have been tried and acquitted, be made the subject of a 
successful application for the acquittal to be quashed and a new trial 
ordered.  That is because, on Mr Robert’s contention, any further trial, 
however carefully managed, regardless of the directions given by the 
judge, would be unlikely to be fair.  In effect therefore, if he is right, the 
publicity over the years has now created an ineradicable prejudice 
against them with the result that they have been immunised against the 
risk of prosecution.  That would indeed be a remarkable result.
--------
86  Our conclusion is a matter of impression based on a careful analysis 
of the material which contains the potentially prejudicial publicity and 
ultimately judgment.” 

59. 	 Referring to the previous authorities the Court concluded that the vast 

amount of publicity relating to the case was unlikely to render the 

subsequent trial unfair. 

60. 	 Finally, in the case of R v Abdullah Ahmed Ali and Others [2011] 

EWCA Crim 1266, a different constitution of the Court of Appeal 

Criminal Division considered whether the appellants could now have a 

fair trial in the light of publicity after the first trial.  Thomas LJ, giving the 

judgment of the Court, referred to the first trial having attracted “world 

wide publicity” and to the “avalanche of publicity” on the day that 

verdicts were delivered and over the following days. 

61. 	 Acknowledging the fundamental importance of the requirement for an 

impartial tribunal, Thomas LJ said that the Court must in each case 

have regard to the trial process and its ability to deal with the publicity 

that had arisen.  Referring to a number of the authorities I have 

included above, he then addressed the appellants’ specific concern that 

jurors would inevitably discover information on the internet 

notwithstanding the Judge’s clear direction to them not to do so, saying 

 
as follows: 

“To the extent that there remains the risk that, despite what jurors are told 
 
by a judge, an individual juror might look up matters on the internet, any 
attempt by an individual juror to use what was found to influence the 
views of other jurors is, in our judgement, bound to fail.  For what was 
found on the internet to have any influence on the verdict of a jury, it
--------
would require other members of the jury to disobey their oath.  In our 
judgement, the observations in Barot and in Abu Hamza hold good and 
the trial process in this trial was capable of coping with the adverse 
 
publicity.” 

The Present Case: Conclusions 
 

62. 	

I am not satisfied on the evidence that there was bad faith here on the 

part of the Prosecution.  Mr Latham raised concerns as to the contents 

of Mr Brenchley’s statement for the Crown Prosecution Service, as 

reported in The Mirror on 27 March.  However, it is customary to use 

the phrase “working closely” with police officers, in relation to charging 

decisions and more generally, and I see nothing sinister in the use of 

that expression. 

63. 	 On its face this statement clearly and entirely properly urged restraint, 

in terms of publicity, and there is no evidence before me to suggest that 

the Crown Prosecution Service did anything other than urge restraint.  I 

accept Mr Lawrie’s submission, and it is not disputed,  that as soon as 

he personally became aware of matters and heard of the strong 

concerns being expressed as to publicity by the defendant’s 

representatives, he gave clear instructions that no more should be said.  

Thereafter efforts were made by the Crown Prosecution Service to urge 

restraint. 

64. 	 Nor am I satisfied that there was bad faith on the part of DSupt Fulcher.  

He frankly and unapologetically gave his reasons for acting as he did 

and expressed robust views in evidence, in an effort to explain and
--------
justify the course he took and the reasons for it.  Further, his evidence 

that his handling of the media was all done under the general 

supervision of the Gold Group was unchallenged.  It is not clear what 

the individual members of the Gold Group actually knew about the 

specific terms in which DSupt Fulcher was briefing the media at his 

press conferences, but it is clear that this officer had authority to 

conduct these press conferences and to issue the various press 

releases, and that position did not change.   

65. 	 Mr Lawrie submits that, while this officer’s judgment may be open to 

criticism, the exercise of poor judgment falls far short of a determination 

that he acted in bad faith.  I agree.  Far from deliberately and 

maliciously drip-feeding information to the media, as Mr Latham 

suggests, I find that DSupt Fulcher was openly and unashamedly 

briefing them for the reasons he gave and which he thought were 

appropriate at the time. 

66. 	 The first seven bullet points in the list of facts referred to above, all 

relating to the evidence which has been ruled inadmissible, all seem to 

me to be information given by DSupt Fulcher at the press conferences.  

The subsequent bullet point facts also came from the police and while 

there are references to “a source” or to “a police source”, the terms are 

used interchangeably.  Although he was not specifically asked about 

this when he gave evidence, I find on the balance of probabilities that 

this information also came from DSupt Fulcher.  However, none of the 

evidence referred to in these subsequent bullet points has been ruled
--------
inadmissible at the defendant’s trial.   

67. 	

I take into account my findings as to the conduct of this officer in my 

 

earlier ruling.  I accept that he was then annoyed and frustrated when 

the defendant stayed silent in interview under caution, as he was 

entitled to, on the advice of his solicitor.  In briefing the media as he did 

DSupt Fulcher was plainly aware of what he was doing, but I find on the 

evidence that he genuinely took the view, misguided as it was, that his 

conduct was appropriate and justified at the time.   

68. 	

I consider that this was a serious error of judgment on his part, but I am 

not satisfied that he was acting in bad faith, or that there was otherwise 

serious fault on the part of the Prosecution, such as to render this 

defendant’s trial an affront to the public conscience and to merit a stay 

of these proceedings on that ground alone.  I do not consider that this 

officer’s misjudgment, serious as it was, is properly to be categorised 

as an assault on the integrity of the criminal justice system.  

69. 	 There is, however, understandable concern by those representing the 

defendant that highly prejudicial, factual information was given to the 

media that has now been excluded as inadmissible evidence.  The key 

elements of that information are that this defendant confessed to two 

murders and led the police to two separate locations where the bodies 

were to be found. 

70. 	 The key question for me, applying the legal principles set out above, is
--------
whether the reporting of all this information and the publicity which 

ensued means that the defendant cannot now have a fair trial.  I 

acknowledge that the risk which Mr Latham identified cannot be entirely 

eliminated, but the question is whether it is still possible for there to be 

a fair trial.  In considering that question I have regard to my own 

experience of criminal trials and of the integrity of the jury and of the 

   
trial process generally. 

71. 	

It is a striking feature of a number of the authorities to which I have 

referred that the sheer scale and intrusive nature of the relevant 

publicity in those cases was substantially greater than that involved in 

the present case.  Not all of it involved ill-informed comment or 

speculative reporting.  Whilst Mr Latham seeks to distinguish such 

reporting from the accurate, factual information given to the media in 

this case, it is not always easy to draw the line.  Some of the publicity 

described in the Dobson case, for example, seems to me to come 
 

close to factual reporting, and there will be other examples, such as 

those cases where a defendant’s previous convictions are, accurately, 

the subject of publicity. 

72. 	 So far as the story itself is concerned, I accept that for the time it ran it 

was a story line which would attract the attention of members of the 

public.  There were pictures of the murder victim and of the defendant; 

and also of the excavations being carried out in the search for the 

bodies.  In my view, however, distressing as it is, it is not one of those 

cases where the facts are so dramatic or horrific that almost everyone
--------
in the land knows of them and will instantly recall them if a particular 

detail is referred to.  For a case like this the rapidly changing nature of 

news stories, including unhappily similar storylines arising from other 

crimes, is such that there is much force in the observation of Scott 

Baker J in Ex Parte B that most people do not remember in detail what 

they have seen, heard or read in the media about such a case except 

for a very short time.   

73. 	 Having analysed all the press reports with care, I accept that, for the 

approximately two-week period that the story ran, the coverage was 

graphic and intense.  The numbers of articles containing the prejudicial 

material were substantial.  However, the “echosonar” graph produced 

by the Prosecution shows that this coverage gradually decreased, the 

intense coverage ending just before 8 April 2011, when the defendant 

first appeared at Bristol Crown Court and when reporting restrictions 

were imposed.  The coverage then ‘flatlined’ completely and, since 

then, it is a relevant factor that there have been no news “spikes” 

relating to any aspect of this case. 

74. 	 The picture is therefore one of intense, prejudicial publicity over a fixed 

period of time in March and April 2011.  Even if it were accurate to 

describe this storyline as “notorious” and I do not think that it is, I accept 

Mr Lawrie’s submission that the sting of notoriety has been drawn by 

the absence of any further reporting thereafter.  In my judgment the 

story inevitably fades.
--------
75. 	 By the time of this defendant’s trial, now fixed to start in February 2013, 

almost two years will have passed.  In these circumstances, that is a 

  

substantial gap in time so far as the risk of recollection by any member 

of the jury is concerned. There is, of course, no mathematical formula 

for assessing the degree of diminution of that risk but, in general terms, 

the greater the lapse of time the more the risk is diminished.  Reporting 

restrictions have remained, and will remain in place until the trial has 

been concluded. 

76. 	 Further, my decision to transfer this defendant’s trial from Bristol to 

Preston, which has already come into effect, provides in my view a 

further, important safeguard in terms of this risk.   

77. 	

I acknowledge that much of the press coverage was national and not 

therefore restricted to local publications in or around Swindon and the 

south west.  I recognise that the story even made it into two local 

publications in the north-east.  However, there is no doubt that this 

story was of particular interest and importance to members of the public 

in Swindon and the surrounding areas.  I am not persuaded, as Mr 

Latham submits, that it is inevitable that at least one of those 

summoned for jury service at Preston Crown Court in February 2013 

will recall the prejudicial publicity in this case, or indeed any aspect of 

this case.  While I accept that the risk cannot ever be entirely 

eliminated, the transfer of this case means that in general terms the risk 

becomes even more remote.
--------
78. 	

It is also the case that, in advance of the hearing before me on 4 April, 

the Head of Media Services at Wiltshire Police circulated a letter to all 

media outlets in relation to Operation Mayan, requesting the removal of 

all internet based press reporting material from 24 – 26 March 2011.  A 

number of media outlets have confirmed removal of material from 

archive websites, including The Daily Telegraph, Associated News (the 

Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday), Mirror Group Newspapers Limited, 

ITN Daybreak and The Sun and The Guardian newspapers.  The BBC 

agreed to ensure that any reporting on active proceedings would not be 

linked to archive material. 

79. 	 Mr Lawrie rightly acknowledges that this, by itself, is of limited 

assistance and that not all media outlets have agreed to cooperate.  In 

general terms, as he rightly accepts, once something is on the internet 

it ‘goes viral’ and cannot be eradicated. 

80. 	 However, in this respect it seems to me to be of particular importance 

to have regard to the emphasis on the collective responsibility among 

members of a jury; and to the directions relating to this that the trial 

judge must now give to a jury at the outset of each criminal trial, (see R 

v Thompson and Others [2010] EWCA Crim 1623, and R v Lambeth 
 

[2011] EWCA Crim 157). 

81. 	 The guidance currently given to Crown Court Judges in the Bench Book 

explains the importance of the Judge emphasising this collective 

responsibility right at the start of the trial, and directing the jurors to
--------
report immediately any concern or any possible irregularity among their 

own number. 

82. 	 Part of the direction now routinely given at the outset of any trial 

involves a clear instruction to the jury, in strong terms, that they must 

not at any stage carry out any research themselves concerning the 

case on the internet, and an explanation of the reasons for that 

instruction, with appropriate warnings as to the serious consequences 

for any juror who disregards it.  One of the reasons for doing this is to 

put the other jurors on guard, should one of their number be tempted to 

disobey that instruction, and to make them aware of the concept of 

collective responsibility for the proper conduct of a fair trial. 

83. 	

In my judgment, the giving of these directions is a further, important 

step diminishing the risk of any faded recollection triggering internet 

research by a juror in breach of the judge’s instruction, and the risk of 

any subsequent contamination of other jurors.  The focus of all the 

jurors, in accordance with their oath or affirmation and supported by 

judicial direction, will be throughout on the evidence to be called at the 

trial. 

84. 	

In that respect the Case Summary prepared by the Prosecution in this 

case demonstrates that there will be a welter of admissible evidence for 

the jury to consider at the trial of this defendant and on which they will 

concentrate, as directed by the Judge and as required by the trial 

process.
--------
85. 	 For all these reasons I am not persuaded to the requisite civil standard 

that it is impossible for this defendant to have a fair trial on the charge 

of murder.  His application for the proceedings to be stayed for abuse of 

process is therefore dismissed.

CHRISTOPHER JOHN HALLIWELL 

 

 
RULING ON PRELIMINARY ISSUE: Admissibility of Evidence 

Introduction 
 

1. 	

The Defendant, Christopher Halliwell, aged 47, is currently before the 

Court on an indictment containing two counts of murder.  Count 1 

charges him with the murder of Sian O’Callaghan, on a day between 

19 and 24 March 2011.  On Count 2 he is charged with the murder of 

Rebecca Godden-Edwards on a day unknown between 2003 and 

2005. 

2. 	

At the PCMH on 28 July 2011 no pleas were entered because the 

Defence indicated that they wanted to raise a challenge to the 

admissibility of the evidence contained in the witness statement of 

Detective Superintendent Fulcher, dated 1 April 2011, together with
--------
other associated evidence said to be tainted by the activities of that 

officer. 

3. 	

The contested evidence relates to the entire series of events which 

followed the Defendant’s arrest until his arrival at the Gable Cross 

Police Station in Swindon some 4 hours later.  It includes an “urgent 

interview” conducted with the Defendant by DSupt Fulcher, before and 

during his indication to the police of the location of Ms O’Callaghan’s 

body, and further admissions made by the Defendant in respect of the 

murder of Rebecca Godden-Edwards and the location of her body.  

4. 	

The challenge to admissibility therefore covers the period from the 

moment of the Defendant’s removal by DSupt Fulcher from his place of 

arrest in the ASDA Walmart car park, Thamesdown Drive in Swindon, 

at 11:06am on 24 March 2011, until his arrival at the Gable Cross 

Police Station at 3:15pm.  

5. 	

On behalf of the Defendant, Richard Latham QC submits that, in what 

he describes as a wholly unique and unprecedented series of events, 

the evidence reveals such substantial and irretrievable breaches of 

PACE and the applicable Codes that this evidence is rendered 

inadmissible.   

6. 	

At the voire dire, which took place over four days, I heard oral evidence 

from DSupt Fulcher, PC Hine, DC Derrick, PI Ewart, PS Strange, DS 

Cooper and Deputy Chief Constable Geenty, who was Assistant Chief
--------
Constable at the relevant time.  A number of witness statements and 

contemporaneous police policy and procedure documents were also 

referred to. The Defendant, who was not called to give evidence on the 

voire dire, has given no indication of his defence to these charges.  He 

answered “No comment” throughout his lengthy interviews under 

caution after his arrival at the police station and no Defence Statement 

has yet been served. 

 
The Facts 

7. 	

In March 2011 the Defendant was working a self-employed taxi driver 

with a company called Five Stars Taxis.  He was working in the 

Swindon area on the evening of 18 March and early hours of 19 March, 

driving a green Toyota Avensis, registration number AV07 FZF.  

Magnetic signs advertising the taxi company were attached to the 

sides of this vehicle. 

8. 	

Sian O’Callaghan, who was aged 22, was living at an address in 

Swindon with her partner.  On the evening of 18 March she went out 

for the evening with some friends, ending up at a nightclub called Suju 

on the High Street in Swindon Old Town.   

9. 	

I have had regard to the entirety of the evidence revealed by the police 

investigation in this case but, for the purposes of the voire dire, it is 

important to set out those facts which played a part in the thinking and
--------
decision-making of DSupt Fulcher as they evolved over the relevant 

period. 

10. 	 Ms O’Callaghan was reported missing at about 09:45 on 19 March.  

PSpt Prichard treated her disappearance as a “level 1 missing person 

investigation”, a level that applies where a person is assessed to be in 

immediate danger or likely to suffer significant harm.   

11. 	

The police strategy, as described by PSpt Prichard, included the 

following: 

 
	 

To locate Ms O’Callaghan and safeguard her from any harm; 

 
	 

To develop intelligence and information in order to establish 

her location; 

 
	 

To utilise media opportunities in order to support these 

objectives; and 

 
	 

To maintain an open mind in terms of any potential criminal act 

and therefore seek to secure and preserve evidence. 

12. 	 Over the next 24 hours there were the following developments in the 

investigation:
--------
(a) 	 CCTV footage showed Ms O’Callaghan leaving Suju alone at 
02:53 on 19 March, walking in the direction of her home about 
10 – 15 minutes walk away. 

(b) 	 CCTV footage also showed a car repeatedly circling the Old 

Town and, shortly after 02:57, stopping by the pavement in the 
High Street in the vicinity where Ms O’Callaghan is last seen. 
The glare of the car’s headlights meant that it was not possible 
to say why the car had stopped.  Nor could its make or 
registration number be made out.  However, after it pulled 
away still travelling towards the camera, Ms O’Callaghan can 
no longer be seen.  The police believed the Ms O’Callaghan 
was now inside it.  The car was driving in the direction of 
Marlborough Road. 

(c)  By chance, at 02:59 this car was picked up on the Marlborough 

Road by a mobile police vehicle with an ANPR facility, which 
was travelling along the Marlborough Road in the opposite 
direction towards the Old Town, but this was not discovered by 
officers investigating Ms O’Callaghan’s disappearance until 22 
March. 

(d)  Ms O’Callaghan’s mobile phone had registered on telephone 

masts at Baydon, at 03:06, and at Cadley, close to 
Marlborough in the Savernake Forest area at 03:25 on 19 
March. 

13. 

The police believed Ms O’Callaghan had been abducted and, in the 

late afternoon of 19 March, a category A police investigation called 

“Operation Mayan” was started, with DSupt Fulcher appointed as 

Senior Investigation Officer (SIO).  Category A is the most serious 

category, denoting a major investigation of significant concern where 

any member of the public is at risk, the offender is unknown and where 

the investigation and the securing of evidence requires the allocation of 

significant resources.
--------
14. 	 DSupt Fulcher designated it a category A investigation because Ms 

O’Callaghan had now been missing for some 12 hours and could not 

be contacted, which was completely out of character.  There were 

therefore significant concerns for her safety. 

15. 	 On assuming command and assessing the information then available 

DSupt Fulcher considered three hypotheses: 

(1) 	 On leaving Suju, Ms O’Callaghan had been enticed into the 
vehicle or forcibly abducted, driven to the Savernake Forest 
area and incapacitated so that she was unable to use her 
phone; 

(2) 	 She had met an acquaintance and gone with them voluntarily, 

failing to make contact with friends or family for reasons 
unknown; or 

(3) 	 She had become separated from her phone and had met with 
an accident or rendered incapacitated by unknown persons or 
events. 

16. 	 He appointed DI Steve Kirby as his Deputy SIO and set up various 

lines of enquiry, including house to house enquiries and the reviewing 

of video footage and telephony.  A media strategy was discussed with 

the designated police media officer and a press release was issued 

 
appealing for information regarding Ms O’Callaghan’s whereabouts. 

17. 	 On 20 March a “Gold Group” was established, chaired by ACC Geenty, 

to provide support to, and oversight of the investigation and of the 

allocation of sufficient resources, given its designation as a “critical 

incident” with potentially far-reaching consequences for the reputation
--------
of the Wiltshire Police Force.  Membership included members of the 

Independent Advisory Group, to represent community interests, and a 

member of the Police Authority.  At 14:20 on 20 March the strategic 

objectives referred to above were reiterated and further steps detailed.   

18. 	

By 21 March however the police were no nearer to discovering who 

had abducted Ms O’Callaghan.  They therefore had no information as 

to her condition or where she might be, save that it was possible that 

she might be in the Savernake Forest area judging from her last mobile 

registration.  Enquiries continued, the crime being regarded as a “crime 

in action” i.e. an offence which is actually occurring while the 

investigation is being conducted including for example, kidnap or 

abduction of the kind in this case.  Resources commensurate with the 

urgency and seriousness of the investigation were made available. 

19. 	

The breakthrough came on 22 March.  The CCTV footage was 

reviewed by an image analyst.  On 22 March the opinion he gave was 

that the car seen on the footage was a dark-tone Toyota Avensis 

estate, manufactured between 2003 and 2008.  He noted the presence 

of a slightly lighter area on the doors, which he thought could be a 

sticker. 

20. 	

By this stage (about midday) DSupt Fulcher amended his hypothesis. 

He considered there could be a sexual motive to the abduction and the 

search criteria were refined to include local beauty spots within the
--------
Cadley mast area, such as Barbury Castle, a large rural location 

popular with walkers and horse riders. 

21. 	 Meanwhile, PS Beresford Smith had spotted the ANPR police car on 

the CCTV footage.  At 12:00 on 22 March he gained access to the 

recordings of vehicles between 02:53 and 03:15 on 19 March.  The 

vehicle which proved to be of interest was a dark coloured car 

travelling from Swindon Old Town with a taxi advert on the driver’s 

door for “Five Star” and the registration number AV07 FZF.  A PNC 

check confirmed the registration number as belonging to a green 

Toyota Avensis estate, with the registered keeper being the Defendant. 

22. 	 He relayed this information to DSupt Fulcher at 2pm.  Thus, by 2pm on 

22 March, the police had a significant and positive lead as to the 

identity of the car used to abduct Ms O’Callaghan and as to its driver.  

The Defendant was at this point nominated as “TIE” (Trace, Interview 

and Eliminate) meaning someone reasonably assumed to be involved 

and in whom the police have an interest as part of their investigation, 

but who is not actually a suspect. 

23. 	

At the same time the Defendant also became a “subject” for the 

purposes of 24-hour covert surveillance, which was authorised on the 

basis of the intelligence then available and which ran from about 15:00 

onwards on 22 March.  The relevant policy book entry (Decision no. 

21) stated “Sian has yet to be found and surveillance provides the best
--------
opportunity of identifying her current location, should Halliwell be 

prompted to return to the deposition.” 

24. 	 Within a short time the surveillance showed the Defendant behaving 

strangely and suspiciously.  Twice in a short period of time after 17:30, 

on 22 March, the Defendant was observed cleaning the rear passenger 

seat of his car with cleaning fluid.  Later that same evening it appears 

that the Defendant attended the police station, telling them that his 

daughter had reported being raped the previous evening.  At 22:02 that 

evening, he was seen depositing items in a wheelie bin (car seat 

covers and head rest covers were subsequently retrieved) and a 

perfume bottle in a dog litter bin.  Just after 00:52 on 23 March he was 

observed on the A420 Oxford Road and then on the B4507 near 

Uffington.  At approximately 02:15 he drove through the village of 

Wanborough and, shortly afterwards, the police spotted material 

burning in a road near the village.  All this information was relayed to 

DSupt Fulcher. 

25. 	

At a briefing held in the morning of 23 March DSupt Fulcher stated that 

the investigation was expected to run into the weekend and that the 

primary objective was to identify where Ms O’Callaghan was.  Media 

and search strategies were said to be the key to the day’s events.  At 

this stage his plan was to try and engage the Defendant through media 

releases in the hope that this would encourage him to return, under 

surveillance, to wherever he had left Ms O’Callaghan.
--------
26. 

At about midday on 23 March detectives went to speak to the 

Defendant at his home address, as part of the TIE process, during 

which a buccal swab was taken.  The Defendant also provided a 

statement, which the Crown state is not to be used at trial, in which he 

gave an account of his movements during the early hours of 19 March.  

Parts of his account were clearly inconsistent with the CCTV footage of 

the Toyota’s movements.  The officers observed that, during the taking 

of this statement, the Defendant appeared to be “stressed”.  He was 

described as “close to tears and visibly shaking”, a description which 

was conveyed to DSupt Fulcher. 

27.  Whilst the TIE statement was being taken from the Defendant, at 13:40 

DSupt Fulcher asked for a meeting with ACC Geenty, so that he could 

appraise him of the current situation and of the covert surveillance and 

media strategy he had deployed to try and prompt the Defendant to 

return to where Ms O’Callaghan was.  The record of this meeting 

includes discussion and agreement of the following matters: 

“In order for him to perhaps lead us to a deposition site he was not 
arrested … He has not been arrested because it is still hoped he 
will take us to a deposition site.  At the moment a TIE is taking 
place now to get an account of his movements from him at the 
material time.  A buccal swab will also be taken.  Strategy SIO 
wishes to take … At teatime news SIO would like to issue a 
statement saying: we are getting close, dogs to be employed, loss 
of daylight search will continue in morning.  Halliwell may respond 
after dark … If he does nothing, arrest evening tomorrow.  The risk 
is that H does himself harm prior to arrest.  SIO explained the 
reported rape of Halliwell’s daughter and circumstances.  ACC 
agreed with decision not to arrest H to date.  Prospect of not 
recovering Sian’s body.  SF said we have evidence of burning etc.  
ACC asked what could go most wrong – major concern is suicide 
of H – ACC said this was manageable and happy with this.  ACC
--------
agreed with rationale around H’s house, that she is unlikely to be 
there and there is nothing we are doing to jeopardise Sian’s life.  H 
is under surveillance – car & house.  SIO would like to recover 
Sian.  A further tactic would be to release press statement 
regarding interest in the Toyota Avensis and sightings of it.  Arrest 
will be affected on 1900 24/3/2011.  ACC is happy that this is an 
appropriate course of action in order to find Sian and secure 
evidence to secure a conviction.” 

28. 	

It is clear on the evidence that, at this point, ACC Geenty supported 

DSupt Fulcher’s general approach and the decisions being taken.  The 

Defendant’s arrest was to be delayed until 7pm on 24 March, in the 

hope that he would lead the police to the place where he had taken Ms 

O’Callaghan. 

29. 	 However, DSupt Fulcher had a genuine concern that the pressure now 

mounting on the Defendant might lead him to commit suicide.  At this 

stage, whilst he feared that Ms O’Callaghan could already be dead and 

it was clear that she was incapacitated, he nevertheless hoped that 

she was still alive and the entire focus of the investigation was still to 

find and recover her alive.  ACC Geenty confirmed in his evidence that, 

notwithstanding the use at times of the terms “body” and “deposition 

site” this was still the entire focus of the investigation.  During the 

briefing with DSupt Fulcher the clear intention of them both was, if at all 

possible, to find Sian O’Callaghan alive. 

30. 	

The press releases at this time were therefore deliberately designed to 

indicate to the Defendant that the police were close to finding Ms 

O’Callaghan, in the hope that this would increase the pressure upon
--------
him and prompt him to return to the place he had taken her.  DSupt 

Fulcher noted (Decision 23) that: 

“It is clear to me that the only way of finding Sian is by HALLIWELL 
taking us to her.” 

The downside of these tactics was the risk of suicide, which was a 

genuine and informed concern. The operational and senior staff were 

briefed to anticipate this risk and to maintain an even closer watch on 

the Defendant. 

31. 	

By 17:00 on 23 March DSupt Fulcher formally nominated the 

Defendant as a suspect, although he accepted in cross-examination 

that, as soon as the decision was taken to “let him run” and not arrest 

him, he had reasonable cause to suspect him to be the perpetrator of 

the crime.  In any event, it was clear by now that the media strategy 

was not working. 

32. 	

Later that evening DSupt Fulcher spoke to DS Cooper, the Wiltshire 

Force tier 5 (highest level) interview adviser, whose role it is to give 

advice, or a steer on interview procedure.  DS Cooper advised him of 

the “urgent interview” procedure under PACE Code C.11.1, which he 

suggested could be used if they were forced to arrest the Defendant 

ahead of the planned time of 7pm on the following day.  DS Fulcher 

had never used this procedure before.  DS Cooper confirmed that he 

thought this was one of those rare occasions when such an urgent 

interview could possibly be justified, given the need to find Ms
--------
O’Callaghan.  In evidence DSupt Fulcher accepted that he was aware 

that all the other elements of PACE, including the giving of a caution, 

still applied to such an interview.   

33. 	 Having received what DSupt Fulcher described as “expert advice” on 

this option he decided to make arrangements for such an interview to 

proceed after the Defendant’s arrest.  In Decision no. 24 he noted: 

“Urgent Interview Strategy – DS Bob Cooper will prepare an 
interview strategy to conduct a suspect interview under Section 
11.1 of PACE with his tier 3 interview team following the 
surveillance team.  When the SIO directs that an arrest be affected, 
an urgent interview will be conducted because at this time I have 
no means of knowing whether Sian is alive or dead and I consider 
this to be an emergency situation which requires measures to be 
taken to identify her location.” 

 

34. 	

At some point on 23 March, although he could not recall exactly when, 

ACC Geenty was informed of the intention to conduct an urgent 

interview, a decision which he accepted as appropriate in the 

circumstances.  In his evidence ACC Geenty agreed that, whilst this 

would be an unusual step to take, the provisions of Code 11.1 enable 

the police, in prescribed circumstances, to conduct an urgent or instant 

interview that cannot await transport to a police station, or await the 

attendance of a solicitor on arrival at the police station if that would 

lead to unreasonable delay.  In this case the prescribed circumstances 

were that delay would be likely to lead to physical harm to Ms 

O’Callaghan.  Save in very special circumstances where, under C.6.6,
--------
access to a solicitor may be denied, ACC Geenty agreed that all the 

provisions of PACE and the Codes, including the requirement to give a 

caution, still apply to urgent interviews of this kind. 

35. 	

Between 11:00pm and 7am on 24 March the Defendant was alone 

inside his house.  DSupt Fulcher remained extremely concerned about 

the risk of suicide during the night and did not himself sleep that night.  

He was therefore relieved to learn that the Defendant was seen driving 

his taxi again early on the morning of 24 March.  However, just after 

10am the Defendant was seen by surveillance officers to deposit two 

wrappings in a waste bin outside Boots.  DSupt Fulcher was informed 

 
at about 10:08 that the Defendant had just purchased “an overdose 

quantity” of paracetamol.  As a result he decided not to wait until the 

evening, but to order the Defendant’s immediate arrest.  

36. 	 On 24 March the Defendant’s arrest was carried out at 11:06 by PC 

Hine in the ASDA Walmart car park, where the Defendant was 

observed to be about to collect shoppers and his car was therefore 

 
stationary at that time.  PC Hine was on duty with PC Mulliss in a 

marked police car that morning.  At about 11am he was told by acting 

DI Hubbard to attend the car park and to arrest the Defendant on 

suspicion of kidnapping Ms O’Callaghan.  He was given a description 

of the Defendant’s vehicle. 

37. 	 On arrival PC Hine saw the vehicle with its boot open and he 

approached it from the rear.  The Defendant was standing inside the
--------
driver’s door, which was open with the keys in the ignition.  PC Hine 

had been given no instructions as to how to affect his arrest.  He 

assessed the situation as one which posed both a risk of escape and a 

risk to his own personal safety.  Given the seriousness of the offence 

he decided he would take no chances and that he needed to prevent 

the Defendant from getting into the car.   

38. 	

As a result the Defendant’s arrest took a robust form. In the 

circumstances no criticism is made of that by Mr Latham on behalf of 

the Defendant but the fact is that the arrest was affected in this way.  

PC Hine immediately detained the Defendant into an arm 

entanglement lock with his right arm and took him to the ground 

shouting “Get on the floor”.  PC Mulliss also attended and the 

Defendant was handcuffed with his arms to the rear.   

39. 	

PC Hine told the Defendant he was being arrested on suspicion of the 

kidnap of Ms O’Callaghan and he then cautioned him.  The Defendant 

responded that he understood. 

40. 	 He placed the Defendant into the rear near-side of the marked police 

car.  He asked him for his name and the Defendant gave it, together 

with his date of birth.  The Defendant asked if he could get his tobacco 

out of his car, but this request was refused.  Asked to describe his 

demeanour for the short time that he was in the police car PC Hine 

said that he appeared calm.  A few minutes later the Defendant was
--------
removed from this vehicle by attending CID officers, for the purposes of 

the urgent interview prepared by DS Cooper. 

41. 	 On the previous day, following his discussion with the SIO, DS Cooper 

had prepared a strategy for this interview and had deputed two 

experienced officers, DCs Derrick and Bevan to conduct it after the 

Defendant’s arrest.  He provided guidance on the procedure to these 

officers, handing them a copy of the provisions of PACE C:11.1, on 

which he had added these words of his own: 

“This investigation is a crime in action.  The whereabouts of Sian 
O’Callaghan are unknown. The SIO has directed that an urgent 
interview be conducted immediately upon the arrest of Mr Halliwell 
to establish the whereabouts of Sian O’Callaghan. 

The questioning is only to establish the whereabouts of Sian 
O’Callaghan and will cease once the risk to Sian’s safety has been 
averted. 

Any questioning will be recorded contemporaneously at the time” 

DS Cooper had discussed this guidance with both officers, 

emphasising that the questions they asked had to focus purely on Ms 

O’Callaghan’s whereabouts.  He also instructed them to caution the 

Defendant before commencing to question him. 

42. 	

Early on 24 March DS Cooper was informed by DSupt Fulcher that the 

 
Defendant’s arrest was being brought forward and he notified DCs 

Derrick and Bevan accordingly.  DS Cooper’s understanding, as he 

explained it in evidence, was that, if the Defendant refused to answer
--------
their questions, the urgent interview would come to a close, at which 

point he would expect the Defendant to be taken to the police station 

where the normal procedures would then be adopted.   

43. 	 DS Cooper drove DCs Derrick and Bevan to the ASDA car park, where 

the Defendant was detained and instructed them to carry out the 

urgent interview. 

44. 	 DC Derrick gave evidence that, as far as he was concerned, their main 

purpose was to find out whether Ms O’Callaghan was alive and where 

she was located, be she alive or dead. 

45. 	 Within minutes of his arrest the Defendant was placed, still handcuffed, 

in their unmarked police vehicle in the car park for this purpose.  The 

Defendant understood that he had been arrested and DC Derrick 

stated that he immediately gave him the “old fashioned” caution, 

applicable in urgent interviews, which he agreed was the priority before 

asking him any questions.  The interview was recorded 

 
contemporaneously and the whole interview, including preliminaries 

and the caution, lasted from 11:20 until 11:28.  At its conclusion the 

Defendant signed it and the contents are not in dispute.  They read as 

follows: 

“DC Derrick: 	
 

        

 

Arrested and Cautioned. 

Explanation of arrest. 


DC Derrick:

--------
O’Callaghan, tell me where Sian is. 

HALLIWELL: 	
 

I don’t know. 

3 3 22: 	

 

Can you help us with where Sian is? 

CH 	

I don’t know where she is, I don’t think I should say 
anymore without speaking to a solicitor. 

3 3 22: 	

Do you know if Sian is safe? 

CH: 

	No comment. 

3 3 22: 	

Can you help us in finding out if Sian is safe? 

CH: 	
 

No comment, not until I speak to a solicitor. 
Can I go to the police station now?” 

46. 	

As far as these two officers were concerned, the urgent interview was 

then at a close.  DC Derrick stated that he could not think of a way of 

formulating any more questions.  He and his colleague both thought 

there was nothing more they could do and that was an end of the 

matter.  Asked to describe the Defendant’s demeanour during this 

interview DC Derrick described him as looking “like a rabbit caught in 

the headlights”. 

47. 	 DC Bevan left the vehicle to tell DS Cooper that the Defendant was not 

saying anything and that he wanted a solicitor and wanted to go to the 

police station.  Once DS Cooper had checked with her that they were 

happy they had covered everything and she confirmed this, DS Cooper 

also considered that was an end of the matter.
--------
48. 	

At 11:45 therefore DS Cooper instructed PS Strange, who was already 

at the scene, to convey the Defendant to the custody unit at Gable 

Cross police station.  Together with PC Hatt, PS Strange took the 

Defendant into his custody at 11:49 and sat him in the back of his 

marked police vehicle.  They set off on their way to the station.   

49. 	

After they had left DSupt Fulcher, who was in the SIO room at Gable 

Cross “pacing the floor”, rang DS Cooper and asked if the Defendant 

had given them any information.  He was told that the Defendant had 

said nothing, that the urgent interview had now ceased and that the 

Defendant was now on his way to the police station. 

50. 	 However, events now took an unexpected turn.  DSupt Fulcher 

instructed DS Cooper not to send the Defendant to the police station 

but to have him taken to Barbury Castle, telling him that he wanted to 

“continue” the urgent interview himself.  DS Cooper stated that he did 

not discuss that instruction with him, but fulfilled the instructions of the 

senior officer in the case.  Whilst it was his view that his officers had 

gone as far as they could go and that the urgent interview had now 

come to an end, the SIO took a different view. 

51. 	

It is significant, given what was to happen, that in Decision 26, DSupt 

Fulcher noted the information he had received as to the Defendant’s 

silence as a “refusal” by him to identify Ms O’Callaghan’s location and 

he agreed in evidence that is how he viewed it.  He noted that he was
--------
going to conduct a “continuing urgent interview as a final attempt to 

persuade him to give me the location of Sian.” 

52. 	 DS Cooper immediately told PI Ewart to stop the police car that was 

now on its way to the station.  PI Ewart contacted PS Strange at 11:51 

and instructed him over his personal mobile not to take the Defendant 

to the police station, but to take him to Barbury Castle.  PS Strange 

then drove the Def, still handcuffed although his arms were now at the 

front, to Barbury Castle.  At first PS Strange did not tell PC Hatt or the 

Defendant where they were going.  On their way, however, the 

Defendant asked “Why are we driving to Marlborough?” He then told 

him that they were going to Barbury Castle and the Defendant 

appeared to nod in acknowledgment.  In that brief interaction between 

them PS Strange described the Defendant’s demeanour as “calm”.   

53. 	

This decision of DSupt Fulcher had not been notified to ACC Geenty.   

54. 	

The Defendant arrived at Barbury Castle at 12:11pm.  DCs Derrick and 

Bevan had also been instructed to go Barbury Castle.  Other police 

officers were already in that area as part of the search teams.   

55. 	

In his evidence DSupt Fulcher gave a full, frank and unapologetic 

explanation of the decision he made and the actions he took.  When 

asked to explain the purpose of his instruction for the Defendant to be 

taken to Barbury Castle, he said that the sole purpose was as “a last 

appeal to him to give me some indication of where Sian O’Callaghan
--------
was”, so as to save her life.  Further, he believed that it was necessary 

for him personally to do this, notwithstanding the failure of the urgent 

interview process to illicit this information, because only he as the SIO 

had the authority to assess the Defendant and to take the decision, 

notwithstanding the “strictures” of PACE, to “look him in the eye and to 

ask him this one thing – will you take me to Sian?”.  His officers could 

only work within the parameters which had been set for them.  He 

deliberately chose Barbury Castle because he considered it to be the 

most likely place where Ms O’Callaghan would be.  Although he 

accepted that he could have conducted a further urgent interview at the 

police station, he said that he considered it better to take the 

Defendant to what he believed at that time to be the most likely scene 

of some crime.   

56. 	 DSupt Fulcher asked a civilian member of staff, Debbie Peach 

(personal assistant) to accompany him, so as to write down what was 

said in the urgent interview of the Defendant that he now intended to 

conduct himself.  Despite the numbers of police officers available, he 

asked no police officer to accompany him for this purpose, either 

before he went to Barbury Castle or after he arrived there.  He wanted 

to speak to the Defendant one-to-one. 

57. 	

In answering question from Mr Lawrie QC, on behalf of the Crown, 

DSupt Fulcher volunteered the information that the Deputy SIO, DI 

Kirby did not agree with what he was proposing to do and that he had 

advised him not to take this step.  DI Kirby told him that he thought it
--------
was not a good idea and that they would be “sailing very close to the 

wind” in terms of breach of PACE.  DSupt Fulcher did not heed that 

advice. 

58. 	 When the Defendant was produced at Barbury Castle DSupt Fulcher, 

who was already there by now, took him a distance of about 50 yards 

away from the car, still handcuffed, in order to talk to him on his own.  

He then interviewed him whilst Ms Peach, standing behind him, did her 

best to write down what was said. 

59. 	

In fact, the accuracy of her summary of this interview is not disputed.  It 

reads as follows: 

“SF introduced himself.  Are you going to tell me where Sian is? 


CH: I don’t know anything. 


Are you going to show me where Sian is.  Whats going to happen. 

If u tell us where Sian is that whatever you will be portrayed you 

would have done the right thing, 


CH: I want to go to the station 


Are you prepared to tell me where Sian is 


CH: You think I did it 


I know you did it. 


CH: Can I go to the station. 


You can go to station.  What will happen is that you will be vilified.
--------
If u tell me where Sian is you would have done the right thing. 

CH: I want to speak to a solicitor 

You are being given an opportunity to tell me where Sian is.  In one 
hour’s time you will be in the press. 

I want to spk to a sol 

You will spk to a sol.  I’m giving you an opportunity to tell me where 
Sian is.  By the end of this cycle you will be vilified, tell me where 
Sian is. 

Have you got a car – we’ll go.” 

60. 	

I note the following important points in respect of this interview.  First, 

whilst this is agreed to be an accurate summary of the interview, it is 

not in dispute that the interview lasted from 12:11 to 12:20pm.  Whilst it 

is not suggested that any questions with different content were asked 

and not recorded, it is accepted that, even allowing for some periods of 

silence during those nine minutes, DSupt Fulcher was repeatedly 

making the same points and asking the same questions and that the 

Defendant was repeatedly giving the same responses before finally 
 

asking DSupt Fulcher if he had a car.  DSupt Fulcher accepted in 

evidence both that this was an interview, and that it took him the best 

part of eight or nine minutes to “persuade” the Defendant to agree to 

assist him.  In the debrief he gave at the station at 18.25 that evening   

he referred to the Defendant as having “eventually” agreed to show 

him the deposition site.  There is no dispute that, although DSupt 

Fulcher referred to “continuing” the urgent interview when he spoke to 

DS Cooper, this was in reality a second, separate interview.
--------
61. 	

Secondly, DSupt Fulcher frankly admitted that it was a deliberate 

decision on his part not to caution the Defendant, or not even to remind 

him that he was still under caution.  The “key issue” he said was to 

save her life and that aim would be thwarted if he opened the interview 

by telling the Defendant that he was entitled not to say anything.  He 

stated that he considered Sian’s right to life was more important than a 

PACE compliant interview and that “I felt it was the right thing to do in 

the circumstances I was faced with”.  Mr Latham asked him if he was 

saying that the end justifies the means.  He answered “Well, in these 

circumstances it does”. 

62. 	

In explaining his thought processes further he stated that, if the 

Defendant had been taken to the police station, he would have been 

booked in and given his rights again.  His request for a solicitor would 

have been granted and the custody sergeant would have ensured that 

whatever happened to him was PACE compliant.  In his view there was 

an equation to balance between the Defendant’s right to silence and 

Ms O’Callaghan’s right to life and her right to life, in his view, was the 

prior claim, even though he realised that it would involve significant 

breaches of PACE.  He was prepared to take this course in order to 

 
achieve that intelligence and stated “I was purely going to persuade 

him to do what in my view was the right thing – to save Sian’s life”.  He 

accepted that there was a fundamental difference between making a 

moral decision in order to gain intelligence and information, which may 

save someone’s life, and translating that intelligence into admissible
--------
evidence in a criminal trial.  Nevertheless, he said that where the 

results of the particular circumstances were as dramatic as they were 

here, essentially the end justified the means. 

63. 	

Thirdly, he explained the questions he asked in the following way.  His 

reference at the start to the fact that the Defendant would have been 

portrayed as having done the right thing, if he told him, was part of his 

appeal to the Defendant, coming so soon after the huge public reaction 

to the case of Joanna Yeates and the initial arrest of an entirely 

innocent man. 

64. 	 Whilst the Defendant was repeatedly asking to be taken to the station 

and asking to speak to a solicitor, he stated that he felt it would be right 

to ignore these requests and to persist with the questioning so that he 

did not “accept the inevitability of Sian’s death by not asking questions 

of the one person who can tell me”. 

65. 	 With the media furore in the Joanna Yeates case fresh in his mind, he 

stated that he told the Defendant that he would be vilified in the press if 

he did not tell him where Sian was because he was “seeking to 

persuade him to do the right thing”.  He agreed that he had told the 

Defendant that he would be talking to the media within the hour and 

part of the persuasion he was using was to tell the Defendant that it 

would be a better position for him to be in, so far as the press were 

concerned, if he told him where Sian was.
--------
66. 	

Fourthly, he described the Defendant’s demeanour throughout this 

interview as “calm” and “subdued”.  As they got into the car so that the 

Defendant could show him where Ms O’Callaghan was located DSupt 

Fulcher’s assessment was that “it appeared as if a weight was lifting 

from his shoulders”. 

67. 	

The rest of Ms Peach’s note and the evidence of PS Strange, who was 

driving, indicate that, once in the police car, DSupt Fulcher sat in the 

back with the Defendant, who gave them directions in a voice 

described as “quietly spoken”.  During this drive DSupt Fulcher 

continued to ask him questions about what had happened, where he 

had killed her, where he had “dumped the body”, whether he had 

repositioned her, whether or not she was clothed and what he had 

done with her phone.  Whilst he referred to this as a “chat”, DSupt 

Fulcher ultimately accepted that this too was an interview and that the 

Defendant had been given no caution before being asked these 

questions.  His explanation for persisting with these questions was that 

if he “took him out of that moment in time he might dry up”.  He agreed 

that if he had been at the police station interviewing him as a murder 

suspect he would not have conducted an interview with him without 

first cautioning him. 

68. 	

The drive took about 45 minutes and they went to a remote rural 

location about 20 miles away, beside the B4507, on the Lambourne 

Downs in South Oxfordshire.  In the end the Defendant could not 

locate the exact point where Ms O’Callaghan’s body was, but he did
--------
provide sufficient information for markers to be set up for the search 

teams.  Her body was found later on that afternoon.   

69. 	 Once this interview had come to an end, at about 13:21, DSupt Fulcher 

told the Defendant that he was now going to hand him over to a police 

constable to arrest him for murder and take him to the police station.  

The Defendant then said words to the effect, “You and me need to 

have a chat”.  DSupt Fulcher said that he was interested to hear what 

the Defendant had to say and he therefore asked PS Strange to drive 

them to a suitable location, out of view of any members of the public.  

70. 	

PS Strange stated that he was instructed to pull off the road at the 

Uffington White Horse, where he then drove some distance up a very 

steep road and pulled over next to a small path, which is used by 

walkers to access the brow of the hill.  DSupt Fulcher and the 

Defendant then got out of the vehicle and walked around 30 – 40 

metres away, with Ms Peach accompanying them, and they sat down 

on the grass at the edge of the path. 

71. 	

The Defendant then said that he was a “sick fucker”, asked DSupt 

Fulcher if he wanted “another one” and told him that he could take him 

to another location, which DSupt Fulcher interpreted as a reference to 

a victim of another murder committed by the Defendant.  However, he 

did not arrest or caution him.  He decided just to continue this process 

because he thought it might be “the only chance to find out what he 

wanted to show me”.  Once again he made a deliberate decision not to
--------
caution the Defendant, stating that “I didn’t consider it relevant to the 

moment in time we were in.  I believed the right thing was to obtain the 

information we were going to get, not contain it”.  Asked to reflect on 

that in the witness box he accepted that, if there was to be a trip to find 

another body, the Defendant could expect to be cautioned and that 

PACE required him to be cautioned. 

72. 	

They then got back into the police car and, at 13:53, set off once again, 

 
the Defendant directing them to drive to a field some 30 miles away 

near the village of Eastleach in South Gloucestershire.  Once there, the 

Defendant pointed to an area in a 40-acre field where he said he had 

buried another woman, whom he had killed at some point between 

2003 and 2005.  Subsequently the police discovered the remains of 

Rebecca Godden-Edwards, a young woman who had not previously 

been reported to the police as missing. 

73. 	 On the way to Eastleach Ms Peach’s notes indicate that DSupt Fulcher 

asked the Defendant a number of further questions about what had 

happened, and that the Defendant observed that “normal people don’t 

go round killing each other” and asked about help he might be able to 

get.  DSupt Fulcher asked him whether there were any more incidents, 

and whether he had done anything in February.  He also asked the 

Defendant more questions about what he had done to Sian 

O’Callaghan and how she was killed.  He told the Defendant that he 

had been the subject of surveillance.  During this conversation, which
--------
DSupt Fulcher agreed was also an interview, the Defendant was 

described as being “quite emotional”. 

74. 	 DSupt Fulcher did not accept that in these extraordinary 

circumstances, when the Defendant first told him about Ms Godden-

Edwards, he should be criticised for not arresting the Defendant for 

murder and cautioning him, even though PACE required him to do so.  

He did not do so because he believed, once again, that it would 

“interrupt the flow” and that the right thing to do was to obtain the 

information and not contain it.  He frankly accepted that, for the next 

hour after the Defendant had offered him “another one”, his actions 

were all non-PACE compliant, even though at this stage the urgent 

interview procedure sanctioned by Code C.11.1 was over.  He 

suggested at one point in his evidence that he thought Code C.11.1 

“could conceivably still apply” since it was also about “preserving 

evidence”, but he subsequently accepted that adherence to the Code 

meant that the Defendant should have been cautioned when he first 

mentioned the case of Ms Godden-Edwards.  He described his role as 

being “to gather such evidence as may come my way or to gather such 

intelligence as may become evidence, subject to the Court’s view”.   

75. 	

At 14:43 the Defendant was finally taken to the police station, DSupt 

 
Fulcher telling him at that point that other officers would “explain his 

rights to him”.  The Defendant arrived at the station at 3:15pm, where 

he was formally processed and requested the assistance of a solicitor.
--------
It is not in dispute that, once they were contacted, the solicitors arrived 

within an hour. 

76. 	 When the Defendant was then interviewed under caution he answered 

“No comment” to all questions asked of him.  DSupt Fulcher stated that 

this surprised, annoyed and frustrated him because he had assumed 

that the Defendant would continue to talk to the interviewing officers in 

the same way he had earlier spoken to him, and that the information he 

had given to DSupt Fulcher would be subsumed in the formal 

interviews.  He referred at one point to the Defendant being given 

“foolish legal advice”. 

77. 	

This, then, is the relevant factual background to the Defence 

application at this voire dire. 

 
The Issues 

78. 	 Mr Latham’s essential submission is that there were, in this case, 

fundamental breaches of both Section 76 and the PACE Codes, so 

that Section 78 is engaged by both and the breaches taken together 

render inadmissible all the evidence of events during the whole of the 

period between this Defendant’s arrest at 11:06 on 24 March and his 

arrival at the police station four hours later at 15:15.   

79. 	

The relevant statutory provisions are as follows.
--------
Section 76 
 

80. 	

Section 76 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE), 

relating to confessions, provides so far as is relevant: 

 

 
“(1)  	

(2)  	

In  any  proceedings  a  confession  made  by  an  accused 
person may be given in evidence against him in so far as it 
is relevant to any matter in issue in the proceedings and is 
not excluded by the court in pursuance of this section. 
If,  in  any  proceedings  where  the  prosecution  proposes  to 
 
give in evidence a confession made by an accused person, 
it is represented to the court that the confession was or may 
have been obtained-

 

(a) by oppression of the person who made it; or 

(b) in consequence of anything said or done which was 
 

likely, in the circumstances existing at the time, to render 
unreliable any confession which might be made by him in 
consequence thereof, 

the  court  shall  not  allow  the  confession  to  be  given  in 
evidence  against  him  except  in  so  far  as  the  prosecution 
proves  to  the  court  beyond  reasonable  doubt  that  the 
confession  (notwithstanding  that  it  may  be  true)  was  not 
obtained as aforesaid. 

… 

(5)  	 Evidence  that  a  fact  to  which  this  subsection  applies  was 
 
discovered as a result of a statement made by an accused 
person  shall  not  be  admissible  unless  evidence  of  how  it 
 
was discovered is given by him or on his behalf. 

(6) 	 Subsection (5) above applies-

 

(a) to any fact discovered as a result of a confession 

which is wholly excluded in pursuance of this section; 
and 

(b) to any fact discovered as a result of a confession 

which is partly so excluded, if the fact is discovered 
as a result of the excluded part of the confession.”
--------
81. 	

The term “oppression” and the test to be applied in considering 

oppression or “improper compulsion”, as it is sometimes described, 

has been considered in a number of well-known authorities.  It has 

most recently been addressed by the House of Lords in Rv. Mushtaq 
 

[2005] 2 Cr.App.R. 32.  Lord Carswell referred in his speech to the way 

that the rules relating to the admissibility of confessions had been kept 

under review over the years in order to “ensure that they reflect the 

standards accepted by each generation”.  In addition to the risk of 

unreliability, he referred to two further factors which had more recently 

influenced the law in rejecting confessions obtained by compulsion, 

namely “the right against self incrimination and the need to exercise a 

degree of controlling discipline over undesirable police practices”.   

82. 	

At paragraph 64 of his speech he said as follows, in referring to 

 
Section 76: 

“64  Oppression is not defined in PACE but its meaning has been 
discussed in a number of decided cases … For present purposes I 
am content to use the definition propounded by Lord MacDermott 
in an address to the Bentham Club in 1968 and adopted by the 
Court of Appeal in R. v Prager (1972) 56 Cr.App.R. 151 at 161, 
[1972] 1 W.L.R. 260 at 266: 

‘…questioning which by its nature, duration or other attendant 
circumstances (including the fact of custody) excites hopes 
(such as the hope of release) or fears, or so affects the mind of 
the subject that his will crumbles and he speaks when otherwise 
he would have stayed silent.’”
--------
Section 78 
 

83. 

Section 78, providing for the exclusion of unfair evidence, provides: 

“(1) 	 In any proceedings the court may refuse to allow evidence 
on which the prosecution proposes to rely to be given if it 
appears to the court that, having regard to all the 
circumstances, including the circumstances in which the 
evidence was obtained, the admission of the evidence 
would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the 
proceedings that the court ought not to admit it.” 
 

 

The Code of Practice for the Detention, Treatment and Questioning of 
Persons by Police Officers 
 

84. 

This Code applies to people in police detention after midnight on 31 

January 2008.  Of relevance to this case are the following provisions: 

“C:6  Right to legal advice 9 
  
 

 

 

 

   

(a) Action 
C:6.1  Unless Annex B applies, all detainees, (must be 
 
informed that they may at any time consult and 
communicate privately with a solicitor, whether in person, 
in writing or by telephone, and that free independent 
legal advice is available.  

 

… 

 

C:6.4  No police officer should, at any time, do or say anything 
with  the  intention  of  dissuading  a  detainee  from  obtaining  legal 
advice. 
 
C:6.5  The exercise of the right of access to legal advice may be 
delayed only as in Annex B. Whenever legal advice is requested, 
and unless Annex B applies, the custody officer must act without 
 
delay to secure the provision of such advice. 
 
C:6.6  A detainee who wants legal advice may not be 
interviewed or continue to be interviewed until the have received 
such advice unless: … 
 

 

 

(b) an officer of superintendent or above has reasonable 

grounds for believing that:
--------
(i) the consequent delay might: 

• lead to interference with, or harm to, evidence connected 
with an offence; 
• lead to interference with, or physical harm to, other 
people; 
• lead to serious loss of, or damage to, property; 
• lead to alerting other people suspected of having 
committed an offence but not yet arrested for it; 
• hinder the recovery of property obtained in consequence 
of the commission of an offence. 

 
(ii) 	    when a solicitor, including a duty solicitor, has been 
contacted and has agreed to attend, awaiting their 
arrival would cause unreasonable delay to the process 
of investigation.  

… 

C:6.7 
If paragraph 6.6(b)(i) applies, once sufficient information 
has been obtained to avert the risk, questioning must cease until 
the detainee has received legal advice unless paragraph 6.6(a), 
(b) (ii), (c) or (d) applies. 

 

C:10 Cautions 
 

 

(a)  When a caution must be given 

  

C:10.1 A person whom there are grounds to suspect of an 
offence, see Note 10A, must be cautioned before any 
questions about an offence, or further questions if the 
answers provide the grounds for suspicion, are put to them if 
either the suspect's answers or silence, (i.e. failure or refusal 
to answer or answer satisfactorily) may be given in evidence 
to a court in a prosecution. A person need not be cautioned if 
questions are for other necessary purposes, e.g.: 
 
(a)  solely to establish their identity or ownership of any 
vehicle; 

 

(b)  to obtain information in accordance with any relevant 
statutory requirement... 
C:10.3 
A  person  who  is  arrested,  or  further  arrested, 
must  be  informed  at  the  time,  or  as  soon  as  practicable 
thereafter,  that  they  are  under  arrest  and  the  grounds  for 
their  arrest,  see  paragraph  3.4,  Note  IOB  and  Code  G, 
paragraphs 2.2 and 4.3.
--------
C:10.4 
arrested, or further arrested, must also be cautioned unless: 

As per Code G, section 3, a person who is 

(a) it is impracticable to do so by reason of their condition or 
behaviour at the time; 
(b) they have already been cautioned immediately prior to 
arrest as in paragraph 10.1. 

 

 

(b) Terms of the cautions 
C:10.5 

The caution which must be given on: 

(a) arrest; 
(b) all other occasions before a person is charged or 
informed they may be prosecuted, see section 16, 

should, unless the restriction on drawing adverse inferences 
from silence applies, see Annex C, be in the following terms: 
""You do not have to say anything. But it may harm your 
defence if you do not mention when questioned something 
which you later rely on in Court. Anything you do say may be 
given in evidence. "" 

C:10.8  After any break in questioning under caution the person 
being questioned must be made aware the remain under caution. 
If there is an doubt the relevant caution should be given again in 
full when the interview resumes. See Note 1OE 
l0E It may be necessary to show to the court that nothing 
occurred during an interview break or between interviews which 
influenced the suspect's recorded evidence. After a break in an 
interview or at the beginning of a subsequent interview, the 
interviewing officer should summarise the reason for the break 
and confirm this with the suspect. 

C: I I Interviews – general  

(a)  Action 
C:11.1 A An interview is the questioning of a person 
regarding their involvement or suspected involvement in a 
criminal offence or offences which, under paragraph 10.1, 
must be carried out under caution. 

C:1 I .1 Following a decision to arrest a suspect, they must 
not be interviewed about the relevant offence except at a 
police station or other authorised place of detention, unless 
the consequent delay would be likely to: 
(a) lead to: 

  interference with, or harm to, evidence connected with a 
 

offence; 

  interference with, or physical harm to, other people; or 
 
  serious loss of, or damage to, property;
--------
(b) 	

 
lead to alerting other people suspected of committing an 
offence but not yet arrested for it; or 

(c) 	 hinder the recovery of property obtained in consequence 

 
of the commission of an offence. 

Interviewing in any of these circumstances shall cease once 
the relevant risk has been averted or the necessary 
questions have put in order to attempt to avert that risk. 
 

C.1l.2 Immediately prior to the commencement or re-
commencement of any interview at a police station or other 
authorised place of detention, the interviewer should remind 
the suspect of their entitlement to free legal advice and that 
the interview can be delayed for legal advice to be obtained, 
unless one of the exceptions in paragraph 6.6 applies. It is 
the interviewer's responsibility to make sure all reminders are 
recorded in the interview record.

C:11.5  No interviewer may try to obtain answers or elicit a 
statement by the use of oppression. Except as in paragraph 
10. 9 no interviewer shall indicate, except to answer a direct 
question, what action will be taken by the police if the person 
being questioned answers questions, makes a statement or 
refuses to do either. If the person asks directly what action 
will be taken if they answer questions, make a statement or 
refuse to do either, the interviewer may inform them what 
action the police propose to take provided that action is itself 
proper and warranted.

85. 

The following general and long-standing principles which apply in 

relation to these provisions, as derived from the authorities, are 

relevant in this case:
--------
(1) 	 Breach of a Code’s provision does not lead automatically to 
exclusion.  Rather, where there is a breach, the Judge has a  
discretion to exclude the evidence. 

(2) 	 The breach must be significant and substantial and the more 
significant and substantial it is the more likely the Judge is to 
exclude the evidence.  A failure to caution in breach of Code 
C:10.1 will normally amount to a significant and substantial 
breach of the Code see (Rv Sparks [1991] Crim LR 128). 

(3) 	 Bad faith or flagrant disregard of the Code’s provisions will 

make exclusion more likely, but there is no requirement for the 
police to have acted in bad faith before evidence is excluded.  
Good faith by the police will not excuse serious breaches of 
the Act and the Codes (see Rv Alladice [1987] Cr.App.R. 380) 

(4) 	 The test to be applied is the test under Section 78.  In applying 

that test the Judge should have regard to the rationale of the 
Code’s provisions and the extent to which the breach is likely 
to defeat that rationale. 

86. 

The evidence and the issues overlap in this case and I have had 

regard to all the facts set out above in deciding each issue, although I 

deal with each one separately. 

87. 

Section 76 
 

The first issue to be decided is whether the Prosecution have 

discharged the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt on the 

evidence that the Defendant’s confession to the murder of Sian 

O’Callaghan in the second urgent interview undertaken by DSupt 

Fulcher was not obtained by oppression, contrary to Section 76.   

88. 

In submitting, on behalf of the Crown, that it was not, Mr Lawrie QC 

submits essentially that what happened here could not truly be said to
--------
amount to oppression, or to have induced this Defendant to speak 

when otherwise he would have not.  The exchange between them was 

relatively short and it was not suggested that DSupt Fulcher’s 

questioning was abrasive or aggressive.  He gave a reasonable 

explanation for his decision to interview the Defendant at Barbury 

Castle.  Whilst not disputing that the officer referred to the Defendant’s 

vilification by the press, Mr Lawrie submits that I must assess these 

statements in their particular context, having regard to DSupt Fulcher’s 

obligations as he saw them and with the Yeates investigation having 

preceded Operation Mayan by only a month or so.  Whilst Mr Lawrie 

conceded that these would not be his “choice of words” he suggested 

that DSupt Fulcher had showed himself to be an officer who had a 

“robust and no-nonsense approach”.   

89. 	

Further, he had taken a record keeper (Ms Peach) with him, so that 

there was no mischief to be attached to his stated aim of eliciting 

information as to Ms O’Callaghan’s whereabouts.  Whilst there was 

therefore a robust use of words the statements and actions of DSupt 

Fulcher were not designed or intended to be oppressive.  The robust 

nature of the Defendant’s arrest was justified in the circumstances and 

the Defendant was a mature man and not someone who was 

vulnerable or who displayed any signs of distress. 

90. 	

I have considered the evidence and the Crown’s written and oral 

submissions with care, but I find on the evidence that they have not 

discharged the burden of proving to the required standard that, in the
--------
particular circumstances of this case, this Defendant’s confession was 

not obtained by oppression.  I consider, for the following reasons, that 

it may have been. 

91. 	

It is correct that the Defendant is not vulnerable within the conventional 

sense of that term.  It is relevant however that, at midday on 23 March, 

he was assessed by the officers who conducted the TIE interview with 

him as under stress, being close to tears and visibly shaking.  He was 

further assessed by DSupt Fulcher and ACC Geenty as a genuine 

suicide risk, due to the mounting pressure upon him from the media 

strategy adopted by the police.  This was a risk assessment as to his 

likely state of mind made by very senior and experienced officers, and 

which prompted the decision to affect his arrest earlier than planned.   

92. 	

Entirely properly Mr Latham makes no criticism of the circumstances of 

the Defendant’s arrest.  PC Hine had to make a rapid assessment of 

the risks involved and an arrest which prevented the Defendant gaining 

access to his vehicle and the possibility of escape was clearly justified.  

However, the nature of his immobilisation and arrest in a car park, in 

the presence of members of the public, are part of the factual matrix in 

this case.  Within a short time of his arrest and during the urgent 

interview he conducted, DC Derrick described his appearance as being 

“like a rabbit caught in the headlights”.  Other descriptions of him as 

being “calm”, based on briefer interactions by other officers, do not 

displace this graphic description of him by an officer who interviewed
--------
him at close quarters for several minutes, as someone who appeared 

dazed and frozen. 

93. 	 Having already been interviewed by two officers in a police car in the 

car park and then told he was to be taken to the police station, the 

Defendant’s journey there was suddenly interrupted in order for him to 

be taken to a rural location some distance away, which was in fact 

wholly unconnected with the scene of any crime in which he had been 

involved, an event which was itself likely to create pressure and 

anxiety.  Once there he was taken out of the vehicle by DSupt Fulcher 

for a one-to-one interview which lasted some nine minutes.   

94. 	 Despite his repeated requests to be taken to the police station and to 

speak to a solicitor, DSupt Fulcher, having deliberately decided not to 

caution him, then sought repeatedly to persuade him to speak.  Whilst I 

accept that the questioning was neither abrasive nor aggressive, the 

clear picture on the evidence is one of persistent and repeated 

questioning, the whole purpose of which was to persuade the 

Defendant to speak when he had clearly indicated that he did not wish 

to.  The clear message being conveyed to the Defendant was that he 

would be permitted to go to the station and to speak to a solicitor only 

when DSupt Fulcher decided that he would allow him to do so. 

95. 	

 
Further, and of particular significance in this case, is the fact that as 

part of his persuasion DSupt Fulcher threatened the Defendant that he 

was going to speak to the press in an hour’s time and that the
--------
Defendant would then be vilified in the press.  This threat was repeated 

at least once and its meaning is clear. 

96. 	

Viewing this entire episode, in my judgment it is at least possible that 

this was questioning which, by it’s nature and given all the surrounding 

circumstances, so affected the mind of this Defendant that he spoke 

when otherwise he would have stayed silent.  For these reasons I find 

that the Prosecution have not discharged the burden to the criminal 

standard and the evidence relating to his confession and the location of 

Ms O’Callaghan’s body is therefore inadmissible pursuant to Section 

76(2) of PACE. 

 
The Codes 

97. 	

The first issue to be decided is whether Code C.11.1 was engaged on 

the facts of this case.   

98. 	

In submitting that it was not Mr Latham points to the references in the 

policy documents and briefing notes for 23 March to “deposition site” or 

to finding a “body”.  He submits that the evidence suggests that, by 

13:40 on 23 March, both ACC Geenty and DSupt Fulcher believed that 

Ms O’Callaghan was already dead and that the strategy was to delay 

the Defendant’s arrest with the prospect of him leading them to the 

place where he had left her body.  The need for an urgent interview 

under C.11.1 was therefore not established.  The reason that the 

Defendant’s arrest was brought forward on 24 March was not a belief
--------
that delay would be likely to lead to physical harm to Ms O’Callaghan, 

but concern that the Defendant might commit suicide. 

99. 	

I cannot accept this submission.  Notwithstanding the occasional use of 

the terms “body” or “deposition site”, I accept the evidence of both ACC 

Geenty and DSupt Fulcher that the entire focus of this investigation 

was the recovery of Ms O’Callaghan alive.  This was a missing person 

investigation.  Intrusive surveillance of the Defendant, the use of 

search teams and a clear media strategy were all being deployed with 

this aim.  DS Cooper gave advice to DSupt Fulcher about the 

possibility of an urgent interview with the Defendant on the basis that 

there was a need to avoid delay likely to cause Ms O’Callaghan 

physical harm.  Other entries in the policy documents reflect this. 

100. 	 Whilst I accept that both DSupt Fulcher and ACC Geenty harboured 

fears that she might be dead, until such time as her body was found 

the police had to proceed, and did proceed on the basis that she was 

still alive.  In my view the preponderance of the evidence before me 

demonstrates that Code C.11.1 was engaged.   

101. 	 So far as events at Barbury Castle are concerned, I shall summarise 

the main submissions made by Mr Lawrie on behalf of the Crown.  He 

submits, essentially, that I should have regard to the particular and 

peculiar context of this case in determining the admissibility of DSupt 

Fulcher’s evidence concerning events after the Defendant’s arrest.  

The decision he took was taken for understandable reasons and
--------
resulted in no significant disadvantage to the Defendant.  This was a 

fast-moving investigation of the utmost gravity and the procedure 

adopted was dictated by the need to find Ms O’Callaghan.  While 

DSupt Fulcher may be criticised for regarding her life as more 

important than the Defendant’s right to silence he clearly considered 

the equation, and the balancing exercise to be conducted, before 

deciding how to proceed.  The saving of life is perhaps the primary 

responsibility of the police.  It is not lightly to be thrust to one side.   

102. 	 He submits further that Code C.11.1 allows a degree of flexibility.  The 

first urgent interview had not produced results and the qualifying 

criteria were therefore still extant.  There was therefore nothing to 

prevent a further urgent interview, if the SIO took a different view from 

that of DS Cooper, which he plainly did.  There was a balance to be 

struck between the rights of the Defendant, the public obligations of the 

police to investigate a serious crime and understandable concerns for 

the safety of Ms O’Callaghan.  DSupt Fulcher made a judgment call in 

this respect which was operationally justified in the circumstances.   

103. 	 Further, he submits that the decision to conduct this interview at 

Barbury Castle was an operational decision, chosen for operational 

reasons and not in order to put pressure on the Defendant.  A proper 

record was kept. 

104. 	

In relation to the failure to caution the Defendant, Mr Lawrie realistically 

accepts not only that a caution was not given, but that a caution should
--------
have been given before this second urgent interview began.  The 

question however is whether that had any impact on the Defendant or 

caused him any disadvantage.  The reason for not giving the caution 

here was because the Defendant might otherwise have stayed silent.  

The question to be determined is the extent to which it is permissible to 

allow a police officer not to caution a suspect where the strategic 

imperative is the saving of life. 

105. 	

In this case Mr Lawrie submits that the Defendant had been given two 

previous cautions, once on his arrest and then again before the first 

urgent interview.  He was plainly aware of his rights and understood 

the cautions he had been given.  It cannot sensibly be suggested that 

he had forgotten them.  Whilst Mr Lawrie accepts that that does not 

obviate the need to give the caution, he submits that it does go to the 

consequences of the failure to give it and therefore to the question of 

 

admissibility of the evidence obtained where no caution was given, in 

particular where there was a most serious offence under investigation. 

106. 	

In considering these submissions the starting point is that the Crown 

 

accepts, entirely properly, that on the evidence in this case two 

separate urgent interviews were carried out.  In addition, it is common 

ground on the evidence that, even where Code C.11.1 is engaged, all 

the other provisions of the Code continue to apply.  That includes what 

Mr Latham referred to as the most fundamental of all Code provisions 

relating to cautions.
--------
107. 	 The provisions of C.10.1 and C.10.8 are mandatory.  A person whom 

there are grounds to suspect of an offence must be cautioned before 

any questions about an offence are put to them.  After any break in 

questioning under caution the person being questioned must be made 

aware that they remain under caution.  If there is any doubt the 

relevant caution should be given again in full when the interview 

resumes.  Failure to caution, even where the police are investigating a 

very serious offence, but perhaps especially when it is a very serious 

offence, amounts to a substantial and significant breach of the Code. 

108. 	 Nor can C.11.1 be used to deny access to legal advice, save in the 

very special circumstances relating to unreasonable delay in C.6.6 (b), 

none of which is applicable in the present case.   

109. 	 Under C.11.1 questioning in any of the circumstances referred to shall 

cease once the risk has been averted, or the necessary questions 

have been put in order to attempt to avert that risk.  In this case, at the 

end of the first interview, properly conducted under caution and 

supervised by the experienced tier 5 interview officer, DS Cooper 

concluded that all the necessary questions had been put to attempt to 

avert the risk.  On his assessment therefore the questioning now had 

to cease. 

110. 	 Whilst I am prepared to accept that, on the facts of this case, it was 

open to the SIO to take a different view, he was in fact deciding to 

conduct a second urgent interview.  It was therefore mandatory for the
--------
Defendant to be cautioned.  At the very least it was necessary for the 

Defendant to be reminded that he was still under caution.   

111. 	 Further, since the purpose of this second interview was to avoid delay 

in discovering Ms O’Callaghan’s whereabouts, this interview could and 

should have been conducted at the police station. The Defendant was 

 
just a short distance away from Gable Cross and could have either 

been formally processed immediately or detained in a holding area for 

this purpose. 

112. 	

Instead, DSupt Fulcher adopted an approach which I consider was 

deliberately designed to ensure that the protections to which this 

Defendant was entitled under the Codes were not afforded to him.  His 

decision not to caution the Defendant was a deliberate one, precisely 

because the Defendant might have done what he would be told he 

could do - stay silent.  His decision not to take the Defendant to the 

police station for interview was, as he accepted, because the custody 

sergeant would have ensured that the Defendant was informed of his 

rights.  On the evidence in this case there is little doubt that the 

Defendant would have requested a solicitor and there is no basis for 

suggesting that there would have been any delay in their arrival given 

that, once a solicitor was contacted, they were able to attend the police 

station within the hour. 

113. 	 Whilst DSupt Fulcher may have considered Barbury Castle to be the 

place where Ms O’Callaghan was most likely to be, the Defendant’s
--------
removal to Barbury Castle, for the purposes of a further urgent 

interview, would not only have resulted in the placing of additional 

pressure upon him, but also provided a mechanism for avoiding the 

Defendant’s request for a solicitor being granted, as it would have been 

had he been in the police station. 

114. 	 DSupt Fulcher was of course entitled to his view that Ms O’Callaghan’s 

life was more important than a PACE compliant interview and that the 

end justified the means.  He was fully entitled to make this moral 

judgment and to adopt an approach designed to secure intelligence 

and information relating to Ms O’Callaghan’s whereabouts.  His 

anxieties in this respect are fully understandable. 

115. 	 However, such an approach has clear consequences in relation to 

admissibility of the information obtained in such circumstances, as 

evidence in a criminal trial.  The Deputy SIO, DI Kirby, was plainly alive 

 
to this in advising DSupt Fulcher not to do what he was proposing to 

do. 

116. 	 Further the “interview” which DSupt Fulcher did carry out is, in my 

view, more accurately to be described as a process designed to 

persuade.  DSupt Fulcher does not deny this.  It explains his decision 

to take only a note-taker with him for recording purposes rather than to 

ask one of the officers in the area to accompany him.  The whole 

rationale was to persuade the Defendant to speak.
--------
117. 	 Nothing in PACE or the Codes, or in any of the authorities to which my 

 
attention was drawn, suggests that these provisions can be ignored 

because of overriding operational issues of the kind which arose in this 

case.  Mr Lawrie was unable to show me any decided case which 

assisted his arguments in this respect.  The cases to which he did 

refer, a number of which were “terrorism” cases, where different 

considerations arise, all turned on their own particular facts.  Whilst 

 
urgent interviews or “safety interviews” as they were described were 

considered in Rv Ibrahim and Others [2008] EWCA Crim 880, a 

reading of that case indicates that in fact each interview with the 

appellants started with a caution.  As May LJ pointed out, giving the 

judgment of the Court (at paragraph 36): 

“The admission of the safety interviews or their fruits, in evidence 
 
at a subsequent trial is subject to the ordinary principles 
governing a fair trial, and the over-arching provisions in Section 
78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) … As 
ever these will be fact specific decisions to be made in the overall 
circumstances of each individual case.” 

118. 	 For the reasons given above and in respect of Section 76 I do not 

accept the submission that what happened in this case had no impact 

upon this Defendant or caused him no disadvantage.  These were 

indeed significant and substantial breaches of the Codes, in 

circumstances deliberately designed to persuade the Defendant to 

speak.  Further questions were asked, all without caution, during the 

journey to the location of Ms O’Callaghan’s body.  Admissibility of this 

evidence would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the 

proceedings that it ought not to be admitted.
--------
Rebecca Godden-Edwards 
 

119. 	 Although I deal with this issue separately, the evidence relating to it is 

all part of the same series of events, resulting from the deliberate 

decision of DSupt Fulcher to act as he did.  My findings above are all 

relevant therefore in considering this matter in addition.  In particular, 

the fact that the Prosecution have failed to discharge the burden of 

proving that there was not oppression in this case is of particular 

relevance in considering the submissions on admissibility relating to 

this evidence. 

120. 	 Once the Defendant had directed DSupt Fulcher to the location where 

Ms O’Callaghan could be found, the qualifying criteria for an urgent 

interview were no longer present.  Pursuant to C.10.1, as soon as he 

started to confess to committing an entirely separate offence he should 

then have been arrested and immediately cautioned.  The planned 

journey to the police station should then have gone ahead.   

121. 	

Instead, DSupt Fulcher asked that they be driven to a quiet place, out 

of view of any members of the public.  He then took the Defendant 

some distance from the car and conducted a further interview, without 

caution, as they were sitting on the grass.  Further, once back in the 

car and en route to the next location, a number of further questions 

were asked, relating both to this incident and to Ms O’Callaghan.  At no 

point was the Defendant cautioned.
--------
122. 	 Mr Lawrie submits that this confession was not the result of any 

decision to persuade the Defendant to speak.  Rather it was an 

unprompted, entirely spontaneous and “old fashioned” confession. 
  

Whilst he accepts that the Defendant should have been cautioned, 

DSupt Fulcher was entitled to have regard to the “moment in time” and 

to the need not to “interrupt the flow”.  These were unique 

circumstances and the Defendant was keen to tell the police about the 

murder.  He therefore suffered no disadvantage in this respect.  This 

was information he provided entirely voluntarily concerning a murder 

victim of which the police had no prior knowledge. 

123. 	 Mr Lawrie relies in this respect on Lord Steyn’s observations as to the 

triangulation of interest in Attorney General’s Ref No 3 of 1999 [2001] 

1CR.App.R 34, as follows: 

“The purpose of the criminal law is to permit everyone to go about 
their daily lives without fear of harm to person or property.  And it 
is in the interests of everyone that serious crime should be 
effectively investigated and prosecuted.  There must be fairness 
to all sides.  In a criminal case this requires the court to consider 
a triangulation of interest.” 

124. 	 He submits that a balance has to be drawn between the competing, 

triangular interests.  In a case where there was no coercion and the 

Defendant was keen to tell the police what had happened the absence 

of a caution should not render this evidence inadmissible.   

125. 	

I have considered carefully Mr Lawrie’s oral and written submissions in 

this respect, but I cannot accept them.  This whole series of events
--------
began with a deliberate decision by a senior officer to breach the 

Codes and it developed into circumstances where I consider there may 

have been oppression, for the reasons I have given.  Once the 

Defendant had directed DSupt Fulcher to the place where Ms 

O’Callaghan could be located, the relevant risk had been averted and 

the qualifying criteria for an urgent interview under C.11.1 no longer 

existed.  There is no doubt on the evidence that C.11.1 was no longer 

engaged. 

126. 	

In these circumstances, once the Defendant began to refer to another, 

entirely different offence, it was not legitimate for DSupt Fulcher to 

decide not to arrest and caution the Defendant, and to decide not to 

 
ensure his immediate transport to the police station.  His explanation, 

that he did not want to interrupt the Defendant’s flow or lose the 

moment in time is, in my view, unacceptable.  Whilst the initial words 

from the Defendant may have been unprompted, they arise from what 

had already passed between them and cannot be viewed in isolation 

from what had gone before. 

127. 	 As soon as he began to talk about another offence it is clear that he 

should have been cautioned.  There should have been no further 

discussions about it and the Defendant should have been taken to the 

police station.   

128. 	

In any event what happened after the initial, unprompted words was, 

on analysis, not the voluntary supply of information by this Defendant.
--------
Once in the car there was clearly a further conversation between the 

 

two of them, with DSupt Fulcher asking a number of questions 

concerning the detail of both these cases.  It was not therefore an 

unburdening on the part of the Defendant, as Mr Lawrie sought to 

characterise it, but a two-way conversation, with the Defendant being 

asked a number of questions about the offences to which he was 

referring, all without caution.   

129. 	 Once again, whilst DSupt Fulcher was entitled to adopt an approach 

which would lead to the gathering of intelligence and information, what 

resulted was not, in my judgment, such as can fairly constitute 

admissible evidence in a criminal trial.  The observations of Lord Steyn 

in the case referred to were in the context of the enactment of Section 

41 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, the aim of 

which was to protect complainants in sexual offence cases from 

indignity and humiliating questioning.  Lord Steyn was not dealing with 

a case involving, as here, wholesale and irretrievable breaches of 

PACE and the Codes in circumstances where the Crown have not 

discharged the burden upon them under section 76 of PACE. 

130. 	 For these reasons, and in the exercise of my discretion under Section 

78 admission of the evidence relating to the confession concerning Ms 

Godden-Edwards and the location of her body, and the circumstances 

in which they arose, would have such an adverse effect on the fairness 

of these proceedings that they ought not to be admitted.
--------
131.  For all these reasons the application made on behalf of the Defendant

 EDWARD DEVENNEY
 

 

 
CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT
 

 

 
SENTENCING REMARKS OF MR JUSTICE SAUNDERS
 

 

12 DECEMBER 2012 


 
 

Between 17th November 2011 and his arrest on 6th March 2012, this Defendant made 
 
determined efforts to enter into an agreement to supply secret information to representatives 
of another country. The reason he later gave for his actions was that he wished to get his own 
back on the Royal Navy who he considered had treated him badly. In the absence of any 
other evidence, I accept that this was his motivation although the objective evidence is that 
the Royal Navy treated him well.  

 

 

 

I also accept that his behaviour generally had been adversely affected by his trial for a serious 
offence in 2010. He was acquitted of that charge, but the pressures caused by the allegation 
and the trial led to him drinking too much and becoming depressed.  However by the time of 
the meeting on 28th January, I am satisfied that the Defendant was completely in control of 
himself. I have watched the video of the meeting between Mr. Devenney and the two men 
who he believed to be representatives of the Russian Secret Service. He appears relaxed and 
in full control of himself. There were no signs that he had been drinking and he was behaving 
rationally. While I am not attempting to assess the Defendant’s mental health by viewing a 
video, there are no obvious signs that he was other than a man who was acting in a 
considered and rational way,    and was prepared to pass any information that he was in a 
position to obtain to the agents. 

 

 

 

 

  

The Defendant was in a position, by virtue of his job, to access top secret information that 
could be of use to another country.  He had taken and downloaded onto his computer 
photographs of part of the Crypto code system to which he should not have had access. Those 
photos were taken two days after he had first contacted the Russian embassy. It is an 
inevitable inference  that the call to the Russian Embassy and the taking of the photographs 
were linked. The photographs could, with other information, have led to the breaking of the 
code. I am satisfied that the Defendant’s intention at the time that he took the photographs 
was to be in a position  to supply that information to representatives of another country 

 

 

 

 

 

1
--------
either as part of an agreement to do so or to demonstrate the value of the  information that 
he could obtain. In order to take those photos he had to obtain access to a locked safe. This 
suggests that he was prepared to take risks to obtain secret information and had the ability to 
get away with it. 

 

 

 

 
The meeting on 28th January was intended by the Defendant to be a meeting at which he 
could satisfy himself that the people who he was talking to were working for Russia. He was 
 
clearly alert to the possibility that MI5 could become aware of what he was doing and he was 
seeking reassurance that the men he was meeting were who they said they were.  The 
Defendant had  time to change his mind about what he was doing after that initial contact 
but he continued to ring  the men who he believed to be Russians to obtain from them  
sufficient proof to satisfy him that they were who they said they were. 

 

 

 

 

 

The Defendant made it clear, at the meeting on 28th January, that he was not able to supply 
secret information on that occasion. In fact he did. It may be that  he did not do it 
deliberately but he did supply details of movements and operations carried out and to be 
carried out by nuclear submarines. While part of that information might be accessible to 
those with the knowledge and ability to find it, it was information that was regarded as secret 
 
by the navy and the Defendant knew that. He himself told the police that he should not have 
made part of those disclosures. I am satisfied that in the wrong hands it was capable of 
affecting the operational effectiveness of nuclear submarines even if only because it came 
 
from a person who was actually serving on a submarine rather than from an uninformed 
source.  It also demonstrated how easy it was for skilled interrogators to get the Defendant to 
supply secret information. He was talking freely to people who he believed might work for a 
foreign country about things that he knew were secret. 

 

When arrested and interviewed the Defendant did not tell the entire truth. At the end of the 
interviews he was shown the videos of the meeting. It provided   incontrovertible evidence of 
what was said during the meeting.   

 

 

This is a very serious case. The Defendant was prepared to betray his country and his 
colleagues. It would have been more serious if information had been supplied to 
representatives of a foreign country. Consequences are always a significant factor in arriving 
at any sentence and while this  is not attributable to the Defendant no actual damage to the 
national interest was caused. I also accept that there is no evidence that the Defendants 
motive was financial gain. I shall deal with him on the basis that he wished to harm the Royal 
Navy because of his complaints about their treatment of him. 

 
 

 

 

 

I accept that the Defendant’s actions between November 2011 and March 2012 were out of 
character with his normal conduct both during his service in the Royal Navy and the rest of 
his life.  I base that, not only on the fact that he has no previous convictions but also because 
of the references that I have read which speak highly and movingly of him. They also detail 
 
the significant effect that the Defendant’s troubles in 2010 had on him. I have considerable 
sympathy for those close to him who have been and will continue to be affected by his 
  
behaviour. 

 

 

 

The Defendant’s plea of guilty will reduce the sentence significantly. It was not entered at the 
first opportunity but it was always made clear to me that his lawyers needed time to carry out 

 

 

2
--------
detailed investigations before they were able to give the Defendant comprehensive advice. 
The evidence was in my judgement overwhelming but a great deal has been saved by the 
avoidance of a trial. The reduction in the sentence that I will give will reflect all those factors.  

 

I have been assisted by detailed submissions on sentence both by the prosecution and the 
defence. One of the matters those submissions has focussed on was whether it is appropriate 
to pass consecutive sentences on Counts 1 and 3. That has happened in some of the Official 
Secrets Act cases to which I have been referred. Where that has happened it has normally 
been to reflect the fact that the offences went on for a very long time. That does not apply 
here. I regard the facts of both counts as being part of the same course of conduct and 
accordingly I pass concurrent sentences. It should however be clearly understood that the 
 
sentences  I pass are intended to cover the totality of the offending of the Defendant. Had he 
only been convicted of one of the offences the sentence on that count would have been 
 
shorter. In this case the sentences can be better understood if they are expressed as 
concurrent sentences. It is the total sentence which is significant.  

 

 

 

 

 

I have been referred to a number of different cases. They are not guideline cases but they do 
indicate the factors which should affect the length of any sentence. I have considered them 
all with care and I have applied the principles that they establish.  I do not think it helpful for 
me to enter into a detailed comparison of the facts. Some are much more serious and others 
are factually dissimilar. Each case is distinguishable from this one. One principle established 
 
in the cases is that it is appropriate in cases like this to pass deterrent sentences. While it can 
properly be said that the Defendant achieved nothing and is unlikely to be in a position even 
if he had the inclination to pass on secret information in the future, others must be 
discouraged from behaving in a similar way. It needs to be understood by those who may be 
tempted to pass on secrets that long prison sentences must follow even unsuccessful 
attempts. For those reasons I reject the Defence submission that a deterrent sentence is not 
appropriate. A consequence of that is that while I take into account the Defendant’s good 
character, it is of less significance than it would have in other cases. The Court also has to 
mark the Defendant’s attempted betrayal of not only his country but also his colleagues who 
must feel great anger at his behaviour. Those who serve their country loyally must know that 
those who don’t will receive proper punishment.  

 

 

 

 

 

 
If you had been convicted of both counts after a trial, a sentence of 12 years would have been 
appropriate. I give you full credit for your plea of guilty and accordingly I reduce the 
sentence to 8 years imprisonment on each count concurrently.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEALSIDE).

Indictment—Delegation of authority by Attorney General—32 and
33 Vic., Cap, 29, sec.28—Obtaining money by false presences.

On an indictment, containing four counts for obtaining
money by false pretences, was endorsed: ""I direct that this indictment be
laid before the grand jury.

[Page 11]

Messrs. Mousseau and Davidson were the two counsel
authorized to represent the Crown in all the criminal proceedings during the
term.

A motion supported by affidavit was made to quash the
indictment on the ground, inter alia, that the 'preliminary formalities
required by sec. 28 of 32 and 33 Vic, c. 29, had not been observed.

The Chief Justice allowed the case to proceed,
intimating that he would reserve the point raised, should the defendant be
found guilty. The defendant was convicted, and it was 

Held, on appeal, reversing the judgment of the
Court of Queen's Bench that under 32 and 33 Vic., c. 29, sec. 28, the
Attorney General could not delegate to the judgment and discretion of another
the power which the legislature had authorized him personally to exercise to
direct that a bill of indictment for obtaining money by false pretences be laid
before the grand jury; and it being admitted that the Attorney General gave no
directions with reference to this indictment, the motion to quash should have
been granted, and the verdict ought to be set aside.

APPEAL from a judgment
of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower
Canada (appeal side), on a case reserved by Sir A. A. Dorion, C.
J., at the September (1880) term of the said Court (Crown side) sitting at Montreal.
The following is the reserved case:

""At the last criminal
term of the Court of Queen's Bench at Montreal, the defendant Levi
Abrahams, was indicted for obtaining money by false pretences.

""The indictment contained four distinct counts, as
follows:

""The jurors for our

day of September, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and
eighty, at the city of Montreal, in the district of Montreal, unlawfully,
fraudulently and knowingly by false pretences, did obtain from one Thomas
Preddy, a certain sum of money, to wit: The sum of twenty dollars currency,
the property of the said Thomas Freddy, with intent to defraud;

""And the jurors aforesaid,

And the jurors aforesaid, upon their oath aforesaid, further
present, that Levi Abrahams on the 25th day of September, in the year of
our Lord one thousand eight hundred and eighty, at the city of Montreal, in

the defendant was charged with four distinct offences of obtaining money by
false pretences, which could not be joined in the same indictment;

""2ndBecause the indictment had been preferred,
without any of the preliminary formalities required by sec. 28 of the Act 32
and 33 Vic, c. 29, respecting procedure in criminal matters having been
observed, and namely that it had not been preferred by the direction of the
Attorney General or Solicitor General of the province of Quebec, or of a
judge of this court, or of any judge of the Superior Court for Lower Canada,
having jurisdiction, and without any preliminary investigation before a
magistrate, and without the prosecutor having been bound by recognizance to
prosecute the defendant or give evidence against him, and without the defendant
having been committed to stand his trial upon the said charge, or detained in
custody, or bound over on recognizance to answer the said indictment.

""This motion was supported
by affidavit; I rejected it, intimating at the time that as I had some doubts,

defendant be convicted.

""The defendant was tried

found guilty on the third and fourth counts, laid in the indictment.

""The evidence adduced at the trial, was that on the 25th of September last, the
defendant sold to Thomas

[Page 14]

Preddy and James Heaton, two
persons recently arrived , in the country, a pass issued by The Gran1 Trunk
Railway Company in favor of A. Carey, and one, entitling the said A.
Carey and another to travel on The Gran1 Trunk Railway from Montreal
to Port Huron, up to the 30th September now last past, and another
pass issued by The Chicago 8c Grand Trunk Railway Company in favor of A.
Carey, and one entitling the said A. Carey and another to travel on The
Chicago & Grand Trunk Railway from Port Huron to Chicago from
date to 27th August, 1S80, which last pass was then out of date by effluxion of
the time for which it had been issued he the defendant, representing to the
said Freddy and Heaton, that these passes were valid and would
entitle them to be conveyed from Montreal to Chicago, by the Grand
Trunk Railway and by the Chicago &r Grand Trunk Railway respectively,
while it was proved that these passes were of no value to the said Freddy and
Heaton, as the first pass, which was not transferable, could only be
used by A. Carey and another person travelling with him, and the time
for Using the second pass had already expired. The price paid for the two
passes was twenty dollars, of which ten dollars were of the moneys of Thomas
Preddy, and ten dollars of the monies of fames Heaton, the whole amount
however being paid through Freddy.

""The passes
were not shown to Heaton and Freddy until after they had paid the
money, and they were then informed that one of them would have to pass by the
name of A. Carey, to which no objection was taken; both Preddy and
Heaton swore that they did not understand what this meant, until they
read the condition that the passes were not transferable, after leaving
defendant's store.

""I reserved the sentence and the defendant is now on bail
to appear before the Court of Queen's Bench on

[Page 15]

the appeal side, and also at the
criminal term on the 24th of March next.

""I now beg to submit,
for the consideration of the Court of Queen's Bench, the following questions :

""1st. Whether the Atorney-Greneral could delegate his authority,
to direct that the indictment in this case be laid before the grand jury and
whether the direction as given on the indictment, was sufficient to authorize
the grand jury to enquire into the charges and report a true bill.

""2nd. Whether if the indictment was improperly laid
before the grand jury it should have been quashed on the motion made by the
defendant.

"" 3rd.
Whether the several counts could properly
be included in the indictment.

""4th. Whether the rulings on the above questions are
correct, and whether there was sufficient evidence of false pretences to
justify a conviction on the third and fourth counts of the indictment.

""Montreal, 30th
October, 1880.

""A. A. Dorion,

""Chief Justice.""

The Court of Queen's Bench held that the conviction on the
indictment was good, and from this judgment the accused Levi Abrahams appealed
to the Supreme Court of Canada.

Mr. Doutre, Q.C., appeared on behalf of the appellant,
and Mr. C. P. Davidson, Q. C. on behalf of the respondent.

The points and authorities relied on by counsel fully appear
in the judgments of the Court of Queen's Bench ([1]),
and in the judgments of the Supreme Court hereinafter given

RITCHIE, C. J.
(alter reading the reserved case):—

In acting under this statute the Attorney or Solicitor-

[Page 16]

General or Judge as the
case may be
exercises what is in the nature of a judicial function, he is judicially to
decide whether the indictment is proper
to be presented to or found by the grand
jury, so that, while on the one hand the rights of
the public are to be guarded,
individuals are to be protected from (as Cockburn, C. J., in Queen v. Bray ([2]) says) “the abuse of the right of prosecution, by proceedings instituted either vexatiously or
from corrupt or sinister motives;” and
the duty of exercising this judicial
discretion when the prosecutor or other
person presenting an indictment has not been bound
by recognizance to prosecute or
give evidence, or where the person accused has not been committed to or detained in custody, or has not been bound by recognizance to appear to answer an
indictment to be preferred against him, is vested
in the Attorney-General or Solicitor-General or Judge
to be by them personally exercised; “the circumstances,”
as Cockburn,C. J., in the same case, says, “under which the direction
shall be given, having been left entirely
within the discretion of one or other of these officers; and with the exercise of which the
court will not interfere.” The Queeu v. Heane ([3]),
shows that where an indictment has been preferred without either of the three
conditions mentioned having been performed, the matter may be brought before the court on affidavit
after plea pleaded, and the indictment may
in the discretion of the court be quashed,
or the party on doubtful case be left to his writ of error. 

I think therefore, this being a special statutory power it
must be strictly pursued; the propriety of sending a bill before the grand jury
having been confided to the judgment and discretion of the Attorney-General he
cannot extend the provisions of the act and delegate to the judgment and
discretion of another the

[Page 17]

power which the legislature has
authorized him personally to exercise, no power of substitution having been
conferred. In the present case it is admitted that the Attorney-General gave no
directions with reference to this indictment; that the gentlemen who put the
indorsement on the indictment did do so merely because they were representing
the crown at the criminal term of the Queen's Bench in Montreal under a
general authority to conduct the crown business at such term, but without any
special authority over or any directions from the Attorney General in reference
to this particular indictment. Under these circumstances the indictment in this
case, having been presented to and found by the grand jury without any
compliance with the provisions of the statute, must be quashed.

STRONG,
FOURNIER AND TASCHEREAU, J. J.,
concurred.

HENRY, J.:—

The prosecution in this case rests entirely upon a statute,
and the legislature have thought it proper to declare that an indictment for
obtaining money by false pretences, can only be laid before the grand jury by
direction of the Attorney General or Solicitor-General, or upon the authority
of a magistrate after a preliminary investigation, or some other person having
a judicial function to perform. It is clear that there is no authority in the
statute authorizing the Attorney-General to delegate this power to another. In
this case there is no evidence of any directions whatever, except the simple
fact that the Attorney-General authorized these gentlemen to represent the
Crown in criminal prosecutions during the then following term, and on this they
pre-pared this indictment and submitted it to the grand jury. It has been
considered that in a certain number of these cases individuals should not be
annoyed by the

[Page 18]

abuse of the right of prosecution, and for that reason the
legislature has thought proper to allow the Attorney-Greneral,
Solicitor-General, or Judge, as the case may be to judicially decide whether
the indictment should be laid before the grand jury. The words of the statute
are clear, and I concur with the Chief Justice in holding that the conviction
should be set aside:

GWYNNE, J. :—

I entertain no doubt that the true construction of the words
in the 28th sec. of 32 and 83 Vic. ch. 29, namely: "" Or
unless the indictment for such offence is preferred by the direction of the
Attorney-General or Solicitor-General for the province,"" is precisely what
the words literally express, namely, that the direction shall be in the
particular case made by one of those officers of the government and not by
another person, who may be appointed to conduct, for the time being, criminal
prosecutions upon the part of the Crown. The intention, I am of opinion, was
that cases of the description mentioned in the section should be first enquired
into before a magistrate, except in cases of emergency, when the discretion of
the Attorney-General, or of the Solicitor-Greneral, as officers responsible to
the public, might be substituted. One of the offences mentioned is that of
conspiracy, which might be to commit a state offence, and which might require
the exercise of much discretion and secrecy of investigation to ensure a
conviction, and in such case the public interests might require that the
responsible law officers of the Crown should be given a discretion as to
preferring or not preferring an indictment. But whether the offence charged be
one of this nature or any other of the misdemeanors mentioned in the section,
the intention of the legislature, I have no doubt, was that no indictment for
any of those offences should be preferred to or entertained

[Page 19]

by a grand jury, unless upon the authority of a magistrate,
after a preliminary investigation, or upon the authority and express direction
of one of the responsible, law officers of the Crown, whose responsibility
could not be delegated to another, or upon the authority of a judge of a court
having jurisdiction to try the offence.

Now, in this case, a motion was made to quash the indictment
upon the ground of its having been found without any of the prescribed
authorities (having been presented to the grand jury upon the authority of the
Queen's Counsel prosecuting at the court on behalf of the Crown). The
indictment ought to have been quashed for the cause assigned, and the court
having reserved for the consideration of the Court of Queen's Bench, whether it
should or not be quashed, that court should have given judgment to quash it,
and the appeal therefore must be allowed.

Appeal allowed.

1          The accused was upon his plea of guilty convicted on the following charges:

th
 day of December 2005 at or about 7 pm, along Serangoon Road, Singapore, together with Lee Jun Quan, Hirandran s/o Shunmugam and Lee Chin Keong, in furtherance of the common intention of you all, did commit theft of a certain property, to wit, one black “Nokia 7260” handphone with value of $385.00 (three hundred and eighty five dollars), in the possession of Mr Ali Late Mochand Sheikh, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 379 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 read with section 34 of the aforesaid Act.”
“DAC 56361/05 (Exhibit P2)
You,
Name:  Lai Yu Wei, m/17 yrs
NRIC:  S8817047 D
DOB:   26.05.1988
Nationality:  Singapore Citizen
are charged that you, on or about the 11
th
 day of December 2005, at or about 7 pm at along Serangoon Road, Singapore, together with Hirandran s/o Shunmugam, Lee Jun Quan and Lee Chin Keong in furtherance of the common intention of you all, did falsely personate yourselves as a public servant, to wit, a Police Officer when you knew you did not hold such office, and in such assumed character, did an act under the colour of such office, to wit, told Ali Miah Late Mochand Sheikh produce his work permit and handphone for a spot-check, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 170 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 read with section 34 of the aforesaid Act.”
2          The facts were as follows:
“           The victim is Ali Miah Late Mochand Sheikh, male 34 years, Fin No. F7656825K.
2          The witness is Aminur Islam Ali Hossein, male 34 years, Fin No. F8074468N.
3          The accused is:

4          The accomplices are:
Hirandran s/o Shunmugam, male 16 years, NRIC No. S8919147E (“Hirandran”);
Lee Jun Quan, male 16 years, NRIC No. S8928795B; and
Lee Chin Keng, male 16 years, NRIC No. S8930196C.
5          On 11 December 2005 at about 8.20 pm, the police were informed that there were many people fighting at the open land opposite Mustafa Centre, Syed Alwi Road.
Facts pertaining to DAC 56361 of 2005
6.         Investigations revealed that on 11 December 2005 at  about 8 pm, the accused and the accomplices approached the victim and the witness.  The accomplices each flashed a card at the victim and the witness, verbally identified themselves as the police and demanded to see their work permits.
7          The victim and the witness duly complied and handed over their work permits to the accomplices, believing that the accused persons and the accomplices were police officers.  The work permits were returned to the victim and the witness.
8          The accused admitted that he had agreed to the suggestion of Hirandran that they pose as police officers to facilitate them stealing handphones from the Bangladeshi nationals in the area.
Facts pertaining to DAC 55378 of 2005
9          After returning the work permits to the victim and the witness, the accomplices demanded to check their handphones.  The victim had a Nokia 7260 handphone valued at $385 and he handed it over to Hirandran.  The accomplices pretended to check the handphone and told the victim that there was a problem with it.  They demanded that the victim wait for them while they returned to the police station for further checks.
10         The victim became frightened, so he took the handphone back and called up a friend for help.  He then handed the handphone over to Hirandran, who passed it to the accomplice Lee Chin Keong.  Lee Chin Keong ran away with the handphone.  The accused and the accomplices fled also, while the victim and the witness gave chase.  The accomplice Lee Chin Keong threw the handphone to the accomplice Lee Jun Quan.  Lee Jun Quan then threw the handphone to the accused.  However, he did not catch hold of the handphone and it dropped to the ground.  He was detained by a number of persons when he tried to recover the handphone.  The handphone was not recovered.
11         The accused admitted that he had agreed with the accomplices to steal handphones from the Bangladeshi nationals in the area and sell them for money.
12         The accused is charged accordingly.”
3          In mitigation, learned counsel for the accused, inter alia, informed the court that accused initially did not want to participate with the co-accused in committing the offences but after some persuasion agreed to join in as “he wanted to be part of a group of friends.”
4          After considering the plea in mitigation, including the age of the accused and his role in the offences, the court was of the view that it would be in order that a pre-sentence report be considered before sentence was imposed.
5.         The pre-sentence report (Exhibit B) was prepared by Probation Officer, Chan Mei Ling and it was Ms Chan’s view that probation was not a viable option for the accused.
6.         In the course of preparing her report, the probation officer had, inter alia, interviewed the accused and his parents and considered written reports from the Discipline Mistress of Nan Hua Primary School (Accused attended this school from 1995 to 2000); the Form Teacher and Principal of Ghim Moh Secondary School (Accused attended this school from 2001 to March 2004).
7          Whilst the prosecuting officer had informed the court on the 2.2.06 that the accused had no antecedents, the probation officer informed the court that the accused had the following antecedent:

8          Accordingly, it was noted that the accused had been dealt with for underage smoking or possession of tobacco on not less than 5 occasions between 17.9.02 and 28.1.04.  In addition to smoking offences, he had also committed theft (had also stolen money from his parents) and littering offences.
9          The probation officer’s assessment of the accused’s parents, their parenting style was that:  whilst the father was concerned about the accused’s well being, his control over the accused was lax and accused would be receptive to his advice only if the father talked to him nicely; and as for the mother the probation officer’s view was that she was over protective and ineffective in managing the accused.
10        The accused’s performance and conduct in school was quite revealing.  Whilst in primary school, his overall conduct was “fair” and there were reports of him often irritating his classmates and using abusive language and fighting with his classmates.  In secondary school, his overall conduct was “poor” and there were reports of disruptive behaviour, using vulgar language and damaging school property.  In Apr 2004, his parents decided to enrol him in a private school as they were of the view that the school (Ghim Moh Secondary School) was being unfair to him.  They alleged that the school authorities “tended to pick on Yu Wei”.  The parents enrolled accused in the TOUCH Youth Learning Centre.  He attended this school from Apr 04 to May 05.  His overall conduct here was again “poor” and there were reports of him playing truant and forging the teacher’s signature in the hostel movement book.  His “persistent poor behaviour and progress” led to the school terminating his association with the school in May 04.
11        From July 05 to Sept 05 the accused was employed as a cashier at “Mech Masters” LAN games shop.  His services at the shop were terminated after 2 computers monitors were stolen during his shift.  One Mr Simon, the accused’s employer at “Mech Masters” reported to the probation officer that the accused “did not put in effort in his work” and was aggressive towards customers on several occasions.  There were also occasions when cash in the cash register did not tally with the amount captured by the computer and there was also an incident where a customer lost his mobile phone when in the shop.  The customer suspected that accused was responsible for the theft and wanted to lodge a police report but did not do so after accused’s mother offered to pay for the lost mobile phone.
12        The probation officer’s assessment of the accused’s suitability for probation was as follows:
“Yu Wei’s involvement in the current offence not only indicates his lack of regard for the law, it also clearly displays his lack of moral values.  The fact that he and the co-accused persons had picked their victims knowing that the victims would be helpless and easy targets reflects their lack of empathy for the victims and boldness which cannot be condoned.
This is not Yu Wei’s first brush with the law.  He had undergone the structured and strict regime of hostel stay and various forms of intervention and these did not deter Yu Wei from breaking the law again.  It is evident that he has not learnt the appropriate values and responsible behaviour from the guidance from external authorities and the skills imparted from the programmes.  As such, PO is doubtful that he would benefit from probation again.  Another concern is that Yu Wei has escalated from offences such as underage smoking to serious, callous and premeditated offences.
The parents are supportive and caring.  Their love and concern for him is taken into consideration and is admirable.  Not only have they been pro-active during his rehabilitation in the past, they have changed their parenting style and continue to try to exercise control and guide Yu Wei towards the right path in life.  However, Yu Wei takes their love and his comfortable lifestyle for granted and appear to have manipulated the parents with his repeated empty promises to behave well.  His failure to appreciate their presence in the past is highly likely to continue with him disregarding their authority.  Nonetheless it is worth noting that despite all the failed assurances, the parents would still like to continue supervising him.
The facts highlights that Yu Wei was on community based rehabilitation, had received the necessary intervention to address his risk issues and needs.  However, his return to crime barely a year upon completion of his probation points to his indifference attitude towards law and order and attested that he had failed to internalise his learnings.  As he appears to lack readiness to change at this point of time, his risk of offending is likely to be high.  PO opines that he is no longer suitable for community based rehabilitation.  All things considered, probation is not a viable option for Yu Wei.”
Learned counsel for the accused had cross-examined the probation officer when she presented her report in court, he, however, did not attempt to submit that she was wrong in her assessment.
13        Considering the information in the report, especially the fact that the offences in the case at hand were committed after the accused had previously undergone probation, the court wholly agreed with the assessment of the probation officer that probation would not be a viable option for the accused.
14        Rehabilitation is the dominant consideration when dealing with a young offender and the court after considering the character and previous conduct of the accused and the circumstances of the offences, was satisfied that it would be expedient with a view to the reformation of the accused and the prevention of crime that he should undergo a period of training in a reformative training centre.  A report with regard to his suitability for reformative training was called.  He was found to be suitable for reformative training and was accordingly sentenced.",2006-03-31 00:00:00,SG District Court

[Exh P1A]
2          On 14 February 2006, the accused was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 2 months.
3          A Notice of Appeal against sentence was filed by the accused on 14 February 2006. He is on bail pending appeal.
The Facts
4          The facts of the case, as set out in the Statement of Facts 
[Exh P2]
, are as follows –
A         BACKGROUND
             Complainant is one Zaiton Bte Abdul Samad, F/52 Nric No. S 0044954 G.  She is a homemaker.
2          Accused is one Jai Shanker s/o Muniandi, M/33 Nric No. S 7223863 Z.  He was previously the sole-proprietor of M/s Fissure Renovation & Construction.
3          B1’s accomplice (B2) is one Hafidaton Bte Hafid, F/32 Nric No. S 7319768 F.  She is the daughter of complainant.
B         FIRST INFORMATION REPORT
4          On 15 Jan 03 at about 10.37 am, the complainant lodged a police report at Bukit Merah NPC alleging that someone had forged her signature on a renovation loan application with Standard Chartered Bank.
C         INVESTIGATIONS
5          Investigation revealed that sometime in mid June 2001, B2 approached the complainant (“her mother”) and obtained from her the HDB Sales Order of her unit and identity card on the pretext of submitting them to her company for documentation purposes.
6          Thereafter, B2 photocopied the said Sales Order and the identity card before returning them to the complainant.  B2’s intention was to use them to obtain a renovation loan from the bank to repay her debts.
D         CHARGE (DAC 035732/2005)
7          Investigation revealed that sometime on or about Sept 2001, B2 approached a renovation company namely “Armstrong Interior Design” located at 279 Balestier Road #02-26 to apply a renovation loan.
8          Thereat, she met the Accused, a sales representative with the said company at that material time to discuss the details of the loan application.  During the discussion, B2 told the Accused that she would like to apply for renovation loan without renovating her home as she needed the cash to repay her debts.
9          The Accused then told B2 that he would charge a commission of 20% of the approved loan amount.  After some consideration, B2 agreed to the condition imposed by the Accused. Both the Accused and B2 then proceeded to conspire to cheat the bank to obtain the home renovation loan.
10         Subsequently, B2 signed the Standard Chartered Bank Home Renovation Loan application and handed copies of the following supporting documents to the Accused:
a)         One certificate of Registration of Birth bearing no. S 7319768 F
b)         One Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore Notices of Assessment in the name of Hafidaton Bte Hafid
c)         One photocopy NRIC of Zaiton Bte Abdul Samad bearing no.S044954G
d)         One photocopy NRIC of Hafidaton Bte Samad bearing no. S 7319768 F
e)         One HDB sales order in respect of complainant’s apartment from the Housing and Development Board to support the application.
11         On 30 Nov 2001, the Accused submitted the above mentioned documents attached with an M/s Fissure Renovation & Construction quotation prepared by the accused to Standard Chartered Bank to support the renovation loan application for B2.
12         On 3
rd
 Dec 2001, the Credit Approval officer of Standard Chartered Bank, Quek Tong Leow approved the loan application for $13,500.00, (reference SCB Renovation loan no. 01861247), to B2 and the complainant.  The next day, SCB disbursed the loan of S$13,230.00 via a Cashier’s Order bearing no. 053536, payable to M/s Fissure Renovation & Construction, but mailed to B2.
13         On receipt of the Cashier’s Order, B2 handed it to the Accused, who then deposited it into his firm’s OUB account on 7 Dec 01.  Thereafter, the Accused deducted a service charge of S$4,500/- before paying B2 the balance of $8,730 by way of a cash cheque on 13 Dec 2001.  B2 then used the money obtained from the loan to clear her debts.
14         Investigation further revealed that no renovation had been carried out at the said unit.  Both the Accused and B2 knew that the above representation that B2 made to Quek of Standard Chartered Bank was false, and they had cheated by submitting the said documents with the intention to dishonestly induce the said Quek of SCB into believing that they were applying for a renovation loan and thereby approving the loan to her, when B2 had no intention to all to use the monies for a renovation, and used the monies to pay of her debts instead.
15         B2 was charged with the offence and was sentenced to a fine for her role in the case.  The complainant has since made full payment to the SCB.
The Antecedents of the accused
5          On 8 June 1993, the accused was convicted of a charge of being a member of an unlawful assembly under s 143 of the Penal Code and a charge of voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 of the Penal Code. He was sentenced to 3 months imprisonment for each charge, with the sentences ordered to run concurrently. On 10 October 1998, the accused was admitted to a drug rehabilitation centre for 6 months for the consumption of a specified drug. On 29 December 2000, the accused was placed under drug supervision for 24 months for the consumption of a specified drug. On 24 May 2001, the accused was convicted of a charge of driving whilst under the influence of drink under s 67(1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) and was fined $2,500 and disqualified from obtaining and holding driving licences for all classes of vehicles for 24 months; a charge for an offence in connection with registration and licensing of vehicles under s 29(1) of the Road Traffic Act and fined $400; and a charge of disorderly behaviour under s 20 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order   and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184) and fined $1,000.
The Mitigation
6          The accused is 33 years old (his date of birth is 11 July 1972), and is married with two young children. He has a son from his previous marriage, and is paying alimony to his ex-wife. He also takes care of his two retired parents, and supports them to the best of his ability.
7          The offence was committed in November 2001, and the accused had changed for the better since then.
8          In January 2006, the accused had resigned from his job as the head of the Sentosa Canine Ranger unit. The accused was an excellent employee, having been awarded a silver Excellence Service Award in 2005 by his employer, Sentosa Development Corporation (“SDC”).  He has been with the employer since at least 2003, and testimonials from the employer show that he was committed and had performed in an outstanding manner in his job. He will seek re-employment with SDC once he is allowed to move on with his life.
9          According to the Mitigation Plea 
[Exh D1]
, the accused had pleaded guilty at the most reasonable stage of the proceedings. He has also made full restitution of the sum of $4,500 which he received before he returned to court to be sentenced. He was remorseful, and apologised for his impulsive behaviour.
The Sentence
Sentencing Options
10        Section 109 of the Penal Code provides that –
Whoever abets any offence shall, if the act abetted is committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the punishment of such abetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence.
Since no express punishment has been so provided, the punishment for an offence under s 417 read with s 109 of the Penal Code is therefore that provided for an offence of cheating under s 417, ie., imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 years, or with fine, or with both.
Relevant Factors
11        The relevant factors for sentencing in a case of deception of financial institutions are the nature of deception, the purpose of the loan, the amount of the loan, whether there was a genuine intention to repay, whether there was repayment, whether there was any loss suffered by the bank, the role of the offender, whether a personal gain was received, whether there was co-operation with the authorities, the plea of guilt and the previous character of the accused and his age: 
PP v Choo Wee Khiang
 (DAC 34876-77/1998, unreported) [see page 452 of Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts (2
nd
 Edition)].
My Decision
12        I had sentenced the accomplice, the loan applicant, to a fine because of the following circumstances in her case. She had wanted to repay the money she cheated the bank of, and did repay until she was unable to do so because of her financial circumstances. However, her mother, the complainant, did repay the money on her behalf and the bank suffered no loss. Further, from her mitigation, the accomplice had needed the money to pay her debts which accumulated after her three surgical operations between 1998 and 2000, and the termination of her employment in September 2001 due to her long sick leave. She was also untraced, and had co-operated with the police.
13        The accused had taken the sum of $4,500 as his commission in helping the accomplice to cheat the bank. Although the accused did repay this amount to the complainant, who had earlier reimbursed the bank the outstanding balance of the loan, this was done at a very late stage, when the case was adjourned for sentencing after his conviction. I therefore did not give the repayment by the accused of the $4,500 very much weight. The table of sentencing for cheating cases involving renovation loans taken from the banks 
[Exh P4]
 show that middlemen who abetted the commissioning of these offences have invariably been sentenced to imprisonment even for offences under s 417.   The lengths of the sentences depended on the amount the bank was cheated of, the amount received by the abettor, and whether the abettor had previous antecedents.
14        The amount of $13,230 that the bank was cheated of was not an unsubstantial sum. The amount of $4,500 taken by the accused was 34% of the loan, and not the 20% he had earlier agreed to take. He also played an important role in providing a quotation for the proposed renovation works.
15        However, the antecedents of the accused, while recent, are not related, and I placed little weight on them in passing sentence. As acknowledged by the deputy, even though the offence was only discovered in January 2003 when the complainant made a police report, there was indeed some delay in the prosecution of this case. While this would have caused little prejudice to the accused, I noted that, cumulatively, in the almost five years since the commissioning of the offence, the accused had stayed on the right side of the law, and has made a change for the better with his life, holding an important appointment, and earning praises from his employer. I took all these into consideration, and while a fine was not appropriate, I imposed a term of 2 months imprisonment as I was of the view that justice would be served by this sentence.",2006-03-14 00:00:00,SG District Court

Choo Han Teck J:
1          The applicant was charged with four charges under s 5(3) of the Employment of Foreign Workers Act (Cap 91A, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the Act”), one charge under s 5(2) and 34 abetment charges under s 5(1) of the Act. Sections 5(1), 5(2) and 5(3) read as follows:
5(1)      No person shall employ a foreign worker unless he has obtained in respect of the foreign worker a valid work permit which allows the foreign worker to work for him.
(2)        No foreign worker shall be in the employment of an employer without a valid work permit.
(3)        No person shall employ a foreign worker otherwise than in accordance with the conditions of the work permit.
2          The maximum penalty for an offence under s 5(1) is a penalty amounting to “not less than 24 months’ levy and not more than 48 months’ levy or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both”. The penalty for an offence under s 5(2) is a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment of up to one year, or to both. The penalty for an offence under s 5(3) is a fine of up to $5,000.
3          The applicant was first charged in court on 15 March 2006 and was released on bail of $40,000 in one surety on 20 March 2006. Three days later, on 23 March 2006, the Prosecution charged him with the 34 charges under s 5(1). Bail was increased to $100,000 in one surety. The applicant was unable to raise bail and had been in remand again since 23 March 2006. He made this application for bail to be reduced to $50,000 in one surety. Mr Kumar, counsel for the applicant, submitted that the applicant earned $1,000 a month as a director of a company that is in the business of recruiting Bangladeshi workers. He denied the charges and stated that he had a valid defence under s 25 of the Act in that he was not the actual offender, and also that he was not in Singapore when the offences under the abetment charges had been allegedly committed. It is, of course, not the function of this court to weigh the merits of his defence, but only to consider whether it was a plausible one. Counsel also submitted that the applicant had no intention of absconding, and that although he was initially released for a few days on $40,000 bail he dutifully returned to court to face the additional 34 charges.
4          The two major issues in bail cases are first, whether bail ought to be granted, and secondly, if so, the appropriate amount of bond to be provided, and other conditions to be added, if necessary. The first issue was not relevant in this application, as it had been decided in the court below that bail was to be offered. The dispute concerned the second issue. Deciding the appropriate amount of bail is not easy because the court has to take into account numerous factors, each of which varies from case to case.
5          A grant of bail serves two important purposes. First, it helps to preserve the “golden thread” in criminal law, namely, that a person is innocent until proven guilty. Innocent people do not normally spend their time in jail. Secondly, there is a need to ensure that accused persons do not abscond before their trial, and bail serves as the instrument by which accused persons are discouraged from absconding. An accused person who absconds will, when arrested, not only stand trial on his original charge, but will also face a further charge for breaching the bail order. In addition to that, his bailor will in all likelihood lose his money posted for the bail bond. Sometimes, as in the present case, the passport of the accused person may be impounded as a condition of the bail. That is an additional measure to make it difficult for the accused to abscond.
6          The idea behind granting bail, therefore, is that an accused person need not be imprisoned if he meets the terms of the bail. In the light of the dual purposes of bail, it should not be surprising that a high percentage of people who are offered bail will be out on bail. Only the impecunious and destitute would find difficulty raising reasonable bail. Determining what is a reasonable bail is an exercise in balancing the dual purposes of bail.
7          What constitutes a reasonable amount for bail will vary from case to case on the specific facts although the broad points have been reiterated 
ad nauseum
 in all bail applications. A summary of some of the main ones can be found in the case of 
Soo Shiok Liong v Pendakwa Raya
 
[1993] 2 MLJ 381
 that both Mr Kumar and Deputy Public Prosecutor Lau Wing Yum referred to. Mr Lau submitted that the accused is suspected of interfering with prosecution witnesses. If that is so, the Prosecution could apply for the bail to be revoked upon proof, but it is presently not an issue before this court. In the present case, after considering the submission of both counsel, and noting that the accused had no record of previous convictions, as well as the fact that he had already spent one week in prison, I am of the view that the bail of $100,000 ought to be reduced to $50,000.
8          The other conditions remain unvaried. The accused is to report daily to the investigating officer or her deputy at such place and time as she might require. Liberty is granted to apply to the District Court in respect of any fresh applications.",2006-03-31 00:00:00,SG High Court

District Judge Valerie Thean:
1.         On 29 November 2005, I ordered the forfeiture of a vehicle, SDN 2364 R, pursuant to the prosecution’s application under s 4 of the Road Vehicles (Special Powers) Act, Cap 277.  On 26 January 2006, Volkswagen Financial Services (Singapore
) Limited, being dissatisfied with the forfeiture, filed an application for criminal revision against that decision.
The application for forfeiture
2.         Volkswagen Financial Services (Singapore
) Limited (“VFS”) are in the business of the hire purchase of motor cars and was the owner of SDN 2364 R (“the vehicle”).  Pursuant to a hire purchase agreement dated 28 July 2004, VFS let the vehicle to one Yogeswari d/o Thiagarajan.  Between 28 July to 5 August 2004, Yogeswari’s husband, Balamurukan s/o Kuppusamy, used it in the course of committing offences of robbery, theft and snatch theft.  He subsequently pleaded guilty to these offences, which were offences under Chapter XVII of the Penal Code and within the schedule to the Road Vehicles (Special Powers) Act (“the Act”).  After Balamurukan was convicted and sentenced, the prosecution applied for the forfeiture of the vehicle under s 4 of the Act. 
3.         Section 4 of the Act reads as follows:
Court to order forfeiture of road vehicle.
4.-(1)  Where it is proved to the satisfaction of a court that a road vehicle has been used in the commission of a scheduled offence or that any scheduled offence has been committed in respect of the road vehicle or in respect of any article found in the road vehicle or on any person found therein, or that a road vehicle has been used for the escape or to facilitate the escape of any persons from the scene of the scheduled offence and that the road vehicle has been seized by the police, the court shall, on the written application of the Attorney-General, make an order for the forfeiture of the road vehicle, notwithstanding that no person may have been convicted of any scheduled offence.
(2)        Any police officer may seize any road vehicle liable to forfeiture under the provisions of this Act.
(3)        An order for the forfeiture or for the release of a road vehicle liable to forfeiture under this section may be made by the court before which the prosecution with regards to the scheduled offence has been held.
(4)        If there be no prosecution with regard to any scheduled offence, the road vehicle seized under subsection (2) shall be forfeited at the expiry of one month from the date or seizure unless a claim thereto is made before that date. Any person asserting that he is the owner of that road vehicle may personally or by his agent authorised in writing give written notice to the Commissioner of Police that he claims the road vehicle.
(5)        Upon receipt of a notice under subsection (4) the Commissioner of Police may direct that the road vehicle be released or may refer the matter by information to a Magistrate.
(6)        The Magistrate on receipt of an information under subsection (5) or on the written application of the Attorney-General shall hold an inquiry and proceed to the examination of the matter and on proof that the road vehicle was used in the commission of a scheduled offence or that any scheduled offence has been committed in respect of the road vehicle or any article found in the road vehicle or on any person found therein or that the road vehicle was used to convey persons to the scene where a scheduled offence has been committed or that the road vehicle was used for the escape or to facilitate the escape of any persons from the scene of a scheduled offence shall order the road vehicle to be forfeited or may in the absence of such proof order its release.
(7) No person shall in any proceedings in any court in respect of the seizure of any road vehicle seized in exercise or the purported exercise of any power conferred under this Act be entitled to the costs of the proceedings or to any damages or other relief other than an order for the return of the road vehicle, unless such seizure was made without reasonable or probable cause.
Arguments
4.         In the present case parties agreed that the requirements specified in s 4(1) were satisfied: there was no dispute that the vehicle was used to facilitate the escape of Balamurukan and his accomplice in this case, the police had seized it, and the Attorney-General had duly made the requisite application.
5.         The prosecution’s view was that forfeiture under s 4 of the Act was mandatory once the conditions of s 4(1) were made out.    This they submitted was clear on a reading of s 4 and a consideration of the parliamentary debates during the reading of the relevant bill.
6.         VFS contended, on the other hand, that the court retained a discretionary power under s 4, which they submitted should be exercised in their favour.  In support, VFS relied upon 
Toh Teong Seng v PP
 
[1995] 2 SLR 281
, where Yong Pung How CJ held that forfeiture under s 20 of the Environmental Public Health Act (“the EPHA”) was not mandatory.  VFS submitted that s 4 of the Act was materially identical to s 20 of the EPHA. 
Analysis
Construction of s 4 of the Act
7.         The starting point in considering the construction of s 4 of the Act must be its ordinary linguistic meaning.  Subsection (1) makes clear that the court must be satisfied as to only two preconditions:
(i).        one of the following:
(a).       that a road vehicle has been used in the commission of a scheduled offence: or
(b).       that any scheduled offence has been committed in respect of the road vehicle or in respect of any article found in the road vehicle or on any person found therein; or
(c).       that a road vehicle has been used for the escape or to facilitate the escape of any persons from the scene of the scheduled offence;
and,
(ii).       that the road vehicle has been seized by the police.
8.         The subsection then follows on to state that upon the written application of the Attorney-General, the court “shall” make an order for forfeiture of the vehicle.  A plain reading of the section suggests that once the two pre-conditions are made out, if the Attorney-General should make a written application, the court must make the order for forfeiture.  It is the Attorney-General who is vested with a discretion whether or not to make an application. 
9.         Subsection (3) specifies that it is the court before which prosecution of the scheduled offence has taken place which is to forfeit or release the vehicle.  Looking at s 4 in context, the power to forfeit would be exercised where subsection (1) was satisfied.  The power of release would be exercised where the preconditions of subsection (1) were not proved to the satisfaction of the court; or the vehicle has not been seized by a police officer; or if the Attorney-General had refrained from making an application. 
Relevant parliamentary material
10.       Parliamentary speeches may be used to confirm that the meaning of the provision is the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision: see s 9(A)(2)(a), Interpretation Act, Cap 1.  The Road Vehicles (Special Powers) Bill was given its second reading on 13 January 1960.   In introducing the Bill, then Minister for Home Affairs Mr Ong Pang Boon made clear that forfeiture was to be mandatory:
… under clause 4(1) of the Bill, the Court 
is required
 to make an order for the forfeiture of the vehicle if it is proved to its satisfaction that a scheduled offence was committed in respect of the article concerned. (emphasis added)
11.       When the Bill was considered in Committee, the issue was specifically discussed.  Mr A.P. Rajah roundly objected to the mandatory nature of the forfeiture in the following terms:
…The section as it now stands is a peremptory one.  It makes it obligatory on the court to confiscate.  Once a scheduled offence has been committed, the court must confiscate.  The Minister now seeks to interpose an application of the State Advocate-General and he is trying to soften the blow… Is the discretion to confiscate or not to be vested with the State Advocate-general and not with the court?  I could understand if the Minister moves an amendment and says the court may make an order; then I would applaud him.  But to take the power away from the court and give it to a Government official I think is not the right thing to do…
12.       Mr Rajah’s objections were robustly rejected by Mr Ong, who stated that “if this Bill is to be effective, then the law must provide that the forfeiture should be mandatory”.  The former Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Toh Chin Chye, also supported Mr Ong’s position.  In the face of opposition, Mr Rajah moved formally for a vote to replace “shall” with “may”, in the following terms:
While agreeing with the Minister for Home Affairs that the police must be given wide powers of seizure, I think any system of justice should see that the balance is held equally between the police, the State and the individual.  The judiciary is there to see that that happens.  We have an extremely efficient judiciary, and these are matters best left to the judiciary who can then have an impartial inquiry into the circumstances in which the offending weapon was found in the car, or the offending person was found in the car.  If the court is satisfied that the owner of the vehicle had absolutely nothing to do with it or had not connived in it in any way, then the court would say that this is one of those cases where the vehicle should be returned to the owner…  The purpose of this amendment, Mr Speaker, Sir, is to give the court an opportunity to go into the matter and then decide whether the article should be forfeited.
13.       Mr Ong replied: “… the law, to be effective, must provide that the forfeiture should be mandatory.  This amendment would make my previous amendment meaningless.  In the circumstances, I cannot accept it.”
14.       Mr Rajah’s suggested amendment was rejected after the matter was put to a vote.  It was therefore clear that Parliament intended, by a majority decision, that the forfeiture of a vehicle be mandatory once the pre-conditions of s 4(1) were satisfied.
Is
 
Toh Teong Seng v PP 
applicable?
15.       The main plank of VFS’ case rested on 
Toh Teong Seng v PP. 
 As mentioned above, that case dealt with a forfeiture provision found in s 20 of the EPHA.  Section 20 of the EPHA read, at the material time, as follows:
(1)        Any person who drops, scatters, spills or throws any dirt, sand, earth, gravel, clay, loam, manure, refuse, sawdust, shavings, stone, straw or any other matter or thing in any public place, whether from a moving or stationary vehicle or in any other manner shall be guilty of an offence.
…
(4)        A court on convicting any person of an offence under subsection (1) shall, on the written application of the Public Prosecutor, make an order for the forfeiture of the vehicle which has been used in the commission of the offence notwithstanding that no person may have been convicted of that offence.
(5)        An order for the forfeiture or for the release of a vehicle liable to forfeiture under subsection (4) may be made by the court before which the prosecution with regard to an offence under subsection (1) has been or will be held.
…
The learned Chief Justice held that the word “shall” in s 20(4) of the EPHA was used in the directory sense, allowing the court to exercise discretion whether or not to make a forfeiture order. 
16.       VFS submitted that s 20 of the EPHA and s 4 of the Act were materially identical, and that the court should, similarly, find that the use of the word “shall” in s 4 of the Act was directory only.
17.       Upon a considered examination of the two sections, I did not find them identical.  The only common factor in both cases was that the Attorney-General was required to make an application.  This distinguishes these two provisions from other kinds of forfeiture provisions such as s 123 of the Customs or s 49 of the Immigration Act, where the court is expected to exercise its power of forfeiture without such an application.  There the similarity ends.  After a close perusal of 
Toh Teong Seng
, I also found that the two primary reasons for the court’s decision in that case were not present in the case at hand.
18.       In 
Toh Teong Seng,
 the main ground for concluding that “shall” was only directory was that subsections (4) and (5) of the EPHA were very poorly drafted.  Subsection (4) was self-contradictory: it was specified that the power was to be exercised by the “court on convicting any person of” an offence under subsection (1), and yet the subsection allowed the court to order forfeiture “notwithstanding that no person may have been convicted of that offence”.  Subsection (4) stated that the court “shall” make an order for forfeiture upon written application.  And yet subsection (5) allowed the court to make an order for the release of the vehicle notwithstanding that it was “liable to forfeiture under subsection (4)”.  Subsection (5) was thus irreconcilable with subsection (4) if the word “shall” was used in a mandatory sense, and the court thus concluded that “shall” was used in a directory sense.
19.       A similar conundrum does not exist in s 4 of the Act.  Subsection (1) states that where a court is satisfied that a road vehicle has been used in various ways in the commission of an office, the court “shall”, on the written application of the Attorney-General, make an order for the forfeiture of the road vehicle.  Subsection (1) is clear and unambiguous in its requirements.  Subsection (3) allows a court to order the release of a vehicle liable to forfeiture.  Unlike s 20(5) of the EPHA which applied to vehicles “liable to forfeiture under subsection (4)”, this power of release does not refer specifically to vehicles liable to forfeiture under subsection (1), it is a power of release referable to the whole of s 4 of the Act.  Owing to this crucial distinction, the power of release within subsection (3) would not be rendered superfluous if the word “shall” in subsection (1) is used in its mandatory sense.  The court may still order release of the vehicle if: (
i
) the pre-conditions of subsection (1) as to the use of the road vehicle in the commission of a scheduled offence has not been “proved to the satisfaction of the court”; or (
ii
) the road vehicle has not been seized by the police in accordance with subsection (2); or (
iii
) no written application for forfeiture is made by the Attorney-General.  In contrast to subsections 20(4) and (5) of the EPHA, a natural and plain interpretation of the subsections 4(1) – (3) of the Act are internally consistent and consonant with its purpose.
20.       A supporting reason used by the court in 
Toh Teong Seng
 in its interpretation of s 20 of the EPHA was that the forfeiture, in that case, was out of all proportion to the minor offences prosecuted under the EPHA.  This rationale is not relevant to the case at hand.  The offences listed in the schedule to the Act are serious ones. 
21.       I therefore held that forfeiture was mandatory for a vehicle seized by the police once the pre-conditions of s 4(1) were proved to the satisfaction of the court and the Attorney-General chose to make the application for forfeiture.
22.       I should mention that in any event, even if there existed discretion on the part of the court, the sole reason proffered by VFS was that it was a hire purchase company and as such, had no direct control over its vehicles.  The High Court has reiterated in 
PP v Mayban Finance (Singapore) Ltd
 
[1998] 1 SLR 462
, 
Credit Corporation (M) Bhd v PP
 3 SLR 762 and 
Hong Leong Finance Ltd v PP
 
[2004] 4 SLR 475
 that finance companies are responsible for the use of their vehicles and for protecting themselves, through insurance or otherwise, against the loss of their vehicles.

District Judge Liew Thiam Leng
1.         The Accused/appellant Ong Ah Yong pleaded guilty to the following charge:-
PS 1604/ 2005 (Exhibit P2)
You, Ong Ah Yong, M/37 yrs, NRIC. S6846810-H, are charged that you on 1
st
 day of January 2003, at or about 3.25 am, at the carpark of Blk 247 Jurong East St 24, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Lim Yeow Ching, to wit, by using a metal rod to hit onto his back torso, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 323 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
Facts of the Case
2          On 1 January, the complainant, Yap Loo Ping called the Police and reported that there was a fight at the car park of Blk 247, Jurong East Street 24. On 31 December, 2002 at about 5pm, while in Malaysia, at a town called Yong Peng, the accused Ong Ah Yong and his family members had a dispute and a fight with the victims and their family members over a trivial matter. On the early morning of 1 January 2003, the accused accompanied his mother to the National University Hospital for medical treatment. The accused then informed a family friend, one Chai Tung Sheng (Chai) of the incident at Yong Peng. Chai came to the hospital subsequently.
3          Whilst at the hospital, the accused noticed that the complainant, the victims and another family member were seeking medical treatment at the same hospital. Chai then informed the accused that he wanted to confront the victims and their family members.  When the victims and their family members left the hospital, the accused and Chai followed them in the accused’s car.
4          On 1 January, 2003 at about 3.25am, upon arriving at the car park of Blk 247, Jurong East Street 24, Chai alighted from the accused’s car and approached the first victim Yap Chwee Teck (Yap) Thereupon, Chai punched Yap’s face, causing Yap to fall to the ground.
5          At this juncture, the accused took a metal rod from a nearby location and approached the second victim Lim Yeow Ching (Lim). The accused then used the metal rod and hit the back torso of Lim. A scuffle then developed between the victim’s family members and the accused including Chai. After exchanging more blows, the accused and Chai fled the scene. The metal rod and an umbrella were recovered at the scene by the police.
6          The medical report of Lim Yeow Ching revealed the following injuries (Exhibit ‘C’).
(a)        Forehead bruising and lower lip swelling.
(b)        Linear abrasion over the face
(c)        Multiple linear abrasions over the back
7          The accused had pleaded guilty to the charge for causing hurt to Lim Yeow Ching under section 323 of the Penal Code.
Mitigation
8          The defence counsel informed the court that the present incident arose out of a dispute and fight between two families at Yong Peng in Johore. The accused and his family returned to Singapore and proceeded to the NUH Hospital for medical treatment as his mother was injured as a result of the fight in Johore. Upon reaching the Hospital, the accused saw the other family seeking medical treatment as well. The accused then informed a close friend of his mother, one Chai Tung Sheng (Chai) about the whole incident. Chai decided to proceed to the hospital and upon reaching there, he saw the accused’s mother having bruises on her face. When the two families left the Hospital, the accused and Chai followed their victims to a car park at Block 247 at Jurong East. Thereupon, Chai lost his composure and punched one Yap Chwee Teck on his face. This resulted in a fracas between the two families and in the process, the accused took a rod and assaulted his victim Lim Yeow Ching. The defence pointed out that the accused was also injured as a result of the incident.
Sentence
9          In assessing sentence, I considered the following factors –
(a)        the degree of deliberation
(b)        the extent of the attack
(c)        the nature of the injury and
(d)        the use of a weapon
10        The facts of the case showed that the accused was unhappy over the dispute at Yong Peng in Johore with the victims. When he saw the victims at the NUH Hospital, he decided to follow them with Chai all the way to the car park at Block 247, Jurong East and confront the victims. It was clear that they wanted to settle the score with the victims. Upon reaching the car park, Chai punched the first victim, Yap Chwee Teck and the latter fell to the ground resulting in serious injuries. (Chai had been dealt with by the court and sentenced to 4 months imprisonment.) The accused then took a metal rod from a nearby location and after confronting the second victim Lim Yeow Ching, he hit the latter on his back torso. After exchanging further blows, the accused and Chai fled the scene.
11        The medical report of Lim Yeow Ching (Exhibit C) showed the following injuries:-
(a)        Forehead bruising and lower lip swelling.
(b)        Linear abrasion over face
(c)        Multiple linear abrasions over back.
12        In the case of 
Public Prosecutor v Lee Seck Hing 
[1992] 2 SLR 745
, in commenting on violence shown by road bullies on our roads at para.12, the Chief Justice indicated that prison sentences must follow where the offence is ‘voluntarily causing hurt’ under section 323 of the Penal Code, and where the offence is the more serious one of ‘voluntarily causing grievous hurt under section 325 of the Code, caning should be imposed. Although in our present case, it was not a case of road bully, the manner in which both the accused and Chai trailed the victims from the Hospital to the car park and assaulting their respective victims would call for a deterrent sentence to deter others from resorting to violence in disregard to the law.
13        In the present case, I considered that the accused had used a dangerous weapon ie, a metal rod in attacking his victim Lim Yeow Ching who suffered injuries. I also considered the mitigation given by the defence counsel and taking all the factors into consideration, I was of the view that a custodial sentence was called for. The punishment for an offence under section 323 of the Penal Code for voluntarily causing hurt is an imprisonment of up to one year or a fine of up to $1000 or both.   The accused was then sentenced to 2 months imprisonment.
14        The accused is appealing against the sentence imposed.",2006-03-09 00:00:00,SG District Court

Choo Han Teck J:
Background
1          The plaintiff and the first defendant are no strangers to each other. In 1998 (Suit No 664 of 1998) the plaintiff sued Timothy Seow Group Architects Pte Ltd (“the Company”) in which the first defendant was the major shareholder and managing director. He obtained a consent judgment before Lai Kew Chai J on 25 February 1999 for $600,321.00 and interest at $19,605.00 as well as costs of the action against the Company. He had also previously worked for the first defendant, and it was in respect of unpaid services that he sued the first defendant in that suit. He was not paid the judgment debt at all because the day after the Company consented to judgment the first, second, and third defendants (in the present action), as directors of the Company, convened a meeting to place the Company under voluntary liquidation on account of its inability to pay its debts. For that purpose, the record (as produced by the Company) showed a total liability of $1,963,374.00 against a net asset of $505,202.00. A resolution to put the Company in liquidation was eventually passed on 6 April 1999 and the Company was wound up on 13 April 1999. The plaintiff now returns to court suing the five defendants as directors of the company. The present action is based on the tort of conspiracy to defraud as well as for a breach of s 340 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 1994 Rev Ed) for conducting the affairs of the Company with the intention of defrauding its creditors. The facts in this action are complicated not only because they were intertwined with the facts in the 1998 suit but also because the first defendant’s name, “Timothy Seow”, was used solely or as part of the name of two other entities, namely, the Company, which was incorporated on 20 January 1996; a sole proprietorship known as “Timothy Seow Group Architects” that was established in August 1995 and dissolved on 20 January 1996 when it was taken over by the Company; and it was also used as the name of a partnership by the first, second, and third defendants after the Company was wound up. The fact that the transfer of Timothy Seow Group Architects by sale was not formalised until 11 July 1997 and backdated to 1 March 1996 will assume its true significance later (I shall revert to this shortly). The facts were also complicated by the operation of a bank account under the name of TSG International Architects Inc maintained in London, into which money due to the Company was sometimes paid.
Timothy Seow, sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation
2          It would be appropriate and convenient, at this point, to digress a little and trace the entities in which the first defendant practised as an architect. Unless this is dealt with here, the narration of the rest of the evidence will be difficult to follow. Although the plaintiff and the first, second and third defendants were each qualified with a degree in architecture, only the first defendant went on to qualify himself in Singapore to practise professionally as an architect. This meant that while the plaintiff and the second and third defendants could do most of the kind of work an architect does (such as designing), they could not hold themselves out as architects and sign or approve documents, plans, drawings and the like. Sometimes, however, their employers might introduce them as “architects” to third parties. This practice in itself is usually harmless. It is like referring to a law graduate as a lawyer even though he has not been admitted to the Bar. The fact that only the first defendant was a qualified architect is relevant because, ostensibly, the others cannot be partners with him in a firm of architects. They can, it seems, be employed by a company (such as the Company) providing architectural services. However, the first defendant had in the course of events been holding out the second and third defendants as his partners, and the Company as a “partnership”. Whether that amounted to any breach of the relevant regulations is of no concern to the present proceedings but it is inevitable that this fact needed to be mentioned because the word “partnership” had been referred to in significant instances. Indeed, the first defendant testified that the pre-incorporation “Timothy Seow Group Architects” was a 
sole-proprietorship
 in which the first defendant held the interests of the second and third defendants in trust. Prior to the establishment of the pre-incorporation “Timothy Seow Group Architects”, the first defendant was a partner, while the second and third defendants were consultants, in a firm called SLH International; and prior to joining SLH International (in 1994), this trio of defendants had worked together as partners in an architectural firm in Vancouver, Canada, where it appears that such practice was permissible.
3          The Registrar (“the Registrar”) of the Board of Architects (“the Board”) testified on behalf of the plaintiff. The Registrar testified that the first defendant initially informed the Board in 1995 that he was practising “alone on his own account” under the name of “Timothy Seow Group Architects”, and applied for a practising certificate for the year 1996. He was granted the practising certificate in his name as he qualified for it. Subsequently, the first defendant decided to incorporate a company with the object of providing architectural services. Such a company, when registered, could also apply for a practising licence if it satisfied the conditions under s 20(1) of the Architects Act (Cap 12, 2000 Rev Ed) which requires, among other things, that the company has a paid-up capital of at least $1,000,000.00, and that the business of the company, so far as it relates to architectural services, be under the control and management of a director who is a registered architect ordinarily resident in Singapore, and who has a practising certificate in force. In the course of that application, the Registrar of Companies had to be satisfied that there would be no objection from the Board of Architects in respect of the use of the name “Timothy Seow Group Architects Pte Ltd” or for any other reason. The only other major concern at that time related to the requirement for a $1,000,000.00 paid-up capital. To that end, the first defendant’s then solicitors, M/s Phyllis Fong & Associates, who later also acted as solicitors for the Company, made further enquiries to the Board about the requirement regarding the Company’s paid-up capital. On 7 February 1996, Phyllis Fong & Associates notified the Board that the Company intended to obtain the requisite licence. The relevant portion of this letter stated as follows:
Our clients intend to meet the pre-requisite requirement of S$1 million paid-up capital through their purchase of assets of up to S$1 million in value from the current firm Heah Hock Heng & Partners. This purchase of assets is duly evidenced by a “Deed” to be duly entered into between our clients (Timothy Seow Group Architects Pte Ltd) and Timothy Seow and others who in turn would purchase the assets from Heah Hock Heng & Partners.
4          The Board replied through the Registrar, stating that the Board would require proof of such paid-up capital “at the time of the application [for the architectural licence]” from the documents lodged with the Registry of Companies, and that a copy of the directors’ resolution confirming the paid-up capital had to be given to the Board. The Registrar also informed the solicitors that the Board “would not normally enquire on how the paid up capital was utilized by the company”. Thus the Company was registered, but at the time, it had not yet applied for a practising licence. On 26 December 1995 the Board reminded the Company to comply with the requirements under the Architects Act, including the requirement for the $1,000,000.00 paid-up capital, and that the “chairman and at least two-thirds of the directors of the corporation shall be registered architects or allied professionals”.
5          The Registrar further testified that on 23 June 1996 the first defendant applied for another practising certificate and in that application he stated that he was practising under the name of Timothy Seow Group Architects 
as a
 
partnership
. However, the Board thought that since the first defendant was already issued with a practising certificate, his application was treated as if it was an application for the 1997 certificate and he was subsequently issued one as such. In August 1997 the Company applied for a renewal of its licence and was granted one. On 14 August 1998 it applied for a renewal and was granted one commencing from 3 September 1998 for a year. In the latter instance, the only change was that the fourth defendant replaced the fifth defendant as a director. Both these directors appeared to be nominal directors and did not participate in any active management of the Company.
6          It will be recalled that the Company was wound up on 13 April 1999, but according to the Registrar, the Board only learnt that the Company had “gone into provisional liquidation” after receiving a letter dated 18 March 1999 from the plaintiff’s solicitors. On 22 March 1999 the Board was notified that the first defendant had ceased practising under the name “Timothy Seow Group Architects Pte Ltd” from 10 March 1999 and was practising under the name “Timothy Seow Group Architects”. By a separate letter of the same date (22 March 1999) the Board was informed that the first and fourth defendants were practising under the “partnership” of “Timothy Seow Group Architects”. However, on the same date, 22 March 1999, the first and fourth defendants wrote to the Board to say that they wished to practise under the name of “Timothy Seow Architects”. Then on 3 May 1999 the liquidator Don Ho wrote to the Board and stated that “there were outstanding projects which certain directors of the company have requested the Liquidators to allow them to continue to service under a partnership by the name of ‘Timothy Seow Group Architects’”. One ought to be alert when reading the names being used or proposed because the change is often just the drop of the word “Group” and sometimes with and other times without the words “Pte Ltd”. The confusion it caused, when put to him, was refuted nonchalantly, and with a touch of indignation, by the first defendant, merely by reiterating, 
ad nauseum
, that Timothy Seow was his name and that one should not expect him not to use it.
7          The Board replied by a letter dated 31 May 1999 in which it stated as follows:
For the record, the name “Timothy Seow Group Architects” was approved by the Board on the application of Mr Timothy Seow to use that name for his sole proprietorship. This was prior to the incorporation of the company known as “Timothy Seow Group Architects Pte Ltd” (“The Company”).
The Board has been advised that the Company is in liquidation and has not been dissolved. Until then, the Company’s legal personality remains. The Board understands that the Company had purchased the goodwill attached to the name “Timothy Seow Group Architects”.
In the circumstances, the use of either “Timothy Seow Architects” or “Timothy Seow Group Architects” is likely to cause confusion because of the similarities with the name of the Company. Therefore, the Board is unable to approve the use of either business name.
The Registrar testified that after initially using a different firm of solicitors to take issue with the Board’s refusal to approve the said names, the first and fourth defendants eventually relented and practised under the name of “Timothy Seow Associates”. He further testified that the Board subsequently convened an inquiry on 17 August 1999 and then exercised its powers under s 29(1) of the Architects Act to revoke the licence to “Timothy Seow Group Architects Pte Ltd” (
ie
, the Company). The closing episode in respect of the parade of names came in October 2002 when, after an exchange of correspondence with M/s Drew & Napier, who acted through the first defendant for a new company, TSG Architects Pte Ltd, the Board granted a practising licence to TSG Architects Pte Ltd. In respect of all the entities bearing the name “Timothy Seow” or “TSG”, it was clearly established to my satisfaction that the first defendant was the principal and directing mind behind them.
8          The documentary evidence also showed that the first defendant had at different times held out his firm as a sole proprietorship and at other times as a partnership. Added to this ambiguity was his and the defendants’ reference to the Company as a partnership. That may reflect the genuine character of the relationship among the defendants but whether that is permitted by the Board is not a subject of the present proceedings. What is relevant is that the first defendant had at various times in the course of the trial used those terms loosely and interchangeably, and that served to reinforce the impression that he was the principal and directing mind behind his firm and the Company.
Sale of the firm to the company
9          I now revert to the plaintiff’s claim proper. Briefly, it was submitted by his counsel, Mr Karthikeyan, that the facts established by the evidence proved either, if not both, the tort of conspiracy to defraud or a breach of s 340 of the Companies Act, in that the business of the company was conducted with the intention to defraud its creditors. The date in which the plaintiff commenced his first action (Suit No 664 of 1998), that is 4 May 1998, is an appropriate starting point. That was the time when the first defendant must have become aware of the seriousness of the plaintiff’s claim and its potential repercussion on him and his practice. It also precipitated a controversial transaction three months later. That is, on 27 August 1998 the first, second, and third defendants signed a contract with the Company which purportedly sold the business of “Timothy Seow Group Architects” as a going concern for $2,201,791.00 to the Company, and under that contract, the completion date was backdated to 1 October 1996. Of the sale price, $1,500,000.00 was stipulated to represent the goodwill of the firm, and $701,791.00 represented the other assets of the business. This effectively meant that a huge debt was created against the Company which must be justified in any event, least of all in circumstances where the debt immediately placed the plaintiff in a disadvantageous position should he succeed (as it turned out he did) in his suit against the Company. Not only that, the first, second and third defendants had withdrawn moneys from that sale although the first defendant initially denied this under cross-examination. His denial could not be maintained after counsel showed him the liquidator’s report and the bank statements.
10        Given the history of the setting up of Timothy Seow Group Architects Pte Ltd, this contract for the sale of Timothy Seow Group Architects in itself, even without any suit by the plaintiff, is a remarkable transaction. It will be recalled that the business of Timothy Seow Group Architects was sold on 11 July 1997 and backdated to 1 March 1996. This was evidenced by the letter of Freddi Lim, the solicitor for the vendor and purchaser, dated 7 August 1997. That deed for the sale was dated 1 March 1996. In that transaction, the business of Timothy Seow Group Architects was sold for $1,000,000.00, including the value of the goodwill of “Timothy Seow Group Architects”, and defined as “goodwill in connection with the use of the name of Timothy Seow Group Architects”. After that, the business belonged to the Company; it simply could not be sold a second time – for any price, let alone more than twice the original price – again. Mr Chandra Mohan made a strong argument merely by asking: How could the first defendant in 1997 have imagined that he would be sued by the plaintiff in 1998 and thus make an elaborate plan to defraud him? In itself, this was an unassailable point but only in so far as fraud against the plaintiff was concerned. It does not alter the fact that the business cannot be sold twice. But the facts reveal the consistency of a cunning mind. The first sale was made because the defendants had to justify the Board’s requirement that the Company must have a paid-up capital of $1,000,000.00. This must be proved and done at the time of the incorporation of the Company. It was not done. The Company did not at that time have that amount of paid-up capital. It is arguable whether it had that paid-up capital at any time – though that issue is not an issue before this court. The deception then, in respect of the first sale, was not against the plaintiff, but against the Board. The defendants’ explanation, that it was due to an oversight, seemed to me to be a convenient excuse. The bare fact was that it did not have a paid-up capital of at least $1,000,000.00 at the time when it was required to do so. The second purported sale, unlike the first, was intended to create a debt against the Company. The first sale was to create an asset so as to back up the requirement of the Board for a paid-up capital of $1,000,000.00. It is not relevant for me to determine whether the Board’s requirement had been complied with.
Revival of the firm
11        I now continue with the facts from the point when the Company was liquidated. The first defendant simultaneously resuscitated “Timothy Seow Group Architects”, transferred the staff of the Company to the revived “Timothy Seow Group Architects”, took over the existing clients of the Company, the furniture, and even the hire-purchase of the computer equipment, and carried on business as usual. In case one forgets, it must be recalled that by the sale contract (the second one), the assets of Timothy Seow Group Architects had been sold to the Company. There was no suggestion that the retaking of the assets post-liquidation was done pursuant to a genuine sellback contract, what in commercial parlance is referred to as a “contract at arm’s length”. The revived “Timothy Seow Group Architects” seemed to have gained financially through its work from the former clients of the Company. It has also to be noted that the defendants continued to use the name “Timothy Seow Group Architects” (even in new projects) after the Company’s liquidation even though the Board had told them not to do so.
12        It is also significant that the defendants used an old letter dated 19 August 1995 from the Board to convince the liquidator that the new firm of “Timothy Seow Group Architects” was approved by the Board (which it specifically said approval would not be given) for use after the liquidation of the Company. This was an incident of outright deceit. The said letter of 19 August 1995 was the letter approving the use of that name when, as it will be recalled, the first defendant left SLH to start his own firm – even before the Company was incorporated, in respect of which a fresh application for approval was required.
The “secret account”
13        After the Company was put in liquidation, the first, second, and third defendants opened a bank account in the name of the Company. The first defendant vehemently objected to plaintiff’s counsel referring to that as “the secret account”. I would hold that in so far as there were at least three people (the first, second and third defendants) who knew about it, it was not a “secret” account in that sense. But the liquidator did not know about it. The plaintiff did not know about it until after the trial had started because the said defendants did not disclose that account. It would have remained unknown if not for references made to it in other documents. The first defendant testified that this account was opened on the advice of the provisional liquidator. The latter was not asked to verify that, and in any event, even if he had so advised, there was no reason not to disclose it. On the contrary, there was, in my view, every reason to disclose the account. On Mr Karthikeyan’s application, I ordered that the statements relating to the account be disclosed. The existence of this account was not disclosed in the Statement of Affairs in the liquidation dated 9 March 1999 although it was opened just a week before that date (on 3 March 1999) and very shortly after the plaintiff obtained judgment in Suit No 664 of 1998 (25 February 1999). The relevance of this account gained in significance when the first defendant ultimately conceded under cross-examination that proceeds from existing projects that the revived “Timothy Seow Group Architects” had taken over from the Company were paid into that account. Those proceeds were not merely from existing clients of the Company but from existing projects. In simple terms, the money belonged to the Company, not the revived “Timothy Seow Group Architects”. Mr Karthikeyan’s cross-examination of the first defendant on those statements established that at least $820,000.00 relating to the projects of the Company was transferred into this account.
14        Mr Chandra Mohan, counsel for the defendants, submitted that there was nothing secret about this account because the liquidator was paid from this account. In my view, that is not a sufficient discharge of the duty to disclose it in the Statement of Affairs and to the plaintiff in disclosure proceedings. It was because of the defendants’ strenuous insistence that this account was personal and irrelevant that no order was made for its disclosure in the interlocutory proceedings. There was thus a clear impression that the defendants had wanted to keep this account a secret. Counsel for the defendants also submitted that the money paid into this account was held in trust for contractors (of the projects) although no details as to the precise terms of such trusts, and also the money that came from new projects, were given. It would be precisely for this reason that the account and how it was operated must be disclosed in the Statement of Affairs. The liquidator can then determine whether any of the transactions were relevant. Reviewing the evidence, I am satisfied that this account was relevant to the liquidator and to this action.
The witnesses and the overall evidence
15        The contemporaneous (as well as backdated) documents gave a clear impression of what really transpired and the motives and intentions behind the acts. The witnesses called in defence, especially the first defendant, strenuously and, at times, denied with great indignation, that there was any fraud or dishonest intention involved in the transactions. I accept that sometimes the oral testimonies of the witnesses might persuade the court to take a more sympathetic view of alleged errant conduct in spite of the signs to the contrary in the documentary evidence. However, in this case, I am not inclined to accept the explanations of the defence witnesses, and least of all, that of the first defendant. Although he gave his evidence, without interruption, repetitively, and calmly, it was a touch too glib, even in the many moments where no exculpatory explanation was possible – such as when he denied, against incontrovertible evidence, that as the goodwill of Timothy Seow Group Architects had been sold, he could no longer use it when the Company was in liquidation. The second defendant (who is also the nephew of the first defendant) and the third defendant seemed to be fully under the control and direction of the first defendant. Neither of them showed any inclination to exert an independent view of their own. Their reticence was not kept or maintained as a result of ignorance of what went on. The evidence showed that they (as directors of the company) acquiesced in the acts of the first defendant. As directors they owe a duty to the Company to act honestly and in good faith. In the present case, they had full knowledge of what the first defendant was up to and in the circumstances, the silence and omission on their part enabled the first defendant to carry out his deeds. As such, I am of the view that they were part of the conspiracy to defraud the plaintiff, as well as the officers responsible in the Company’s defrauding of its creditors. The fourth and fifth defendants were directors of the Company during some of the material times in which dishonest conduct was being perpetuated; I am satisfied that they were purely nominal directors and they were not fully aware of what was in fact going on. In their case, although they might not have been fully vigilant as directors, but that alone is not sufficient, in my view, for me to find that they were part of the conspiracy to defraud, or that they were aware that the affairs of the Company were being carried out with the intent to defraud its creditors. The difference between them and the second and third defendants is the extent of their knowledge and involvement. That does not mean that the fourth and the fifth defendants were not in breach of their duties as directors, but that was not a relevant inquiry before me on the case as pleaded.
16        There were instances in which the first defendant appeared to conceal or attempted to conceal damaging evidence. For instance, he wrote to the provisional liquidator on 12 March 1999 to inform the latter that the company had 13 ongoing projects. When the provisional liquidator was replaced by Mr Don Ho as the liquidator, the first defendant wrote (on 5 May 1999) to inform him that only four projects were ongoing. Nine projects seemed to have vanished in less than two months. When questioned by counsel, the first defendant gave some ostensibly plausible answers suggesting that some projects were withdrawn or just could not take off. Further cross-examination showed that these suggestions could not possibly be true because some of the projects that the first defendant had identified as “not taking off” had in fact taken off and were paying money that was then deposited into the secret account.
The defendants’ professional witnesses
17        Although the three professional witnesses of the defendants, namely, the auditor, John Teo, and the solicitors, Freddi Lim and Phyllis Fong, testified on behalf of the defendants to show that the first defendant and the Company acted on professional advice and thus did nothing that merited closer scrutiny, I am unable to accept an implication embedded in their testimonies that the conduct of the first, second and third defendants was without blemish because evidence elsewhere showed otherwise. Furthermore, these professionals were too closely connected to the affairs of the Company and, therefore, lacked sufficient detachedness. John Teo, the auditor, appointed by the Company, also introduced the provisional liquidator. Furthermore, his firm owned the secretarial services that prepared some of the crucial documents for the Company, including the resolution of directors purporting to rectify the failure of the Company to have the paid-up capital required by the Board. Don Ho was the more independent of the professionals; but as the evidence showed, he was not given the full facts.
Had the plaintiff proved his case?
18        The first defendant testified that the Company had no alternative but to declare insolvency when the plaintiff rejected its offer to pay $10,000.00 and insisted, instead, for a sum of $100,000.00, declaring that there was no room left for negotiation in those circumstances. Given the full picture that we now have, the Company was clearly not insolvent but a viable going concern with more than adequate resources to pay at least $100,000.00 if not the full judgment sum of $600,000.00. The first, second and third defendants, in my view, had no intention of paying the plaintiff his due or any part of it. Their intention was to scorch the Company and take all its stock of assets and projects out of the plaintiff’s reach in the event of enforcement proceedings. The handwritten notes in the documents indicated that the first, second and third defendants had braced themselves for the eventuality of judgment against them in Suit No 664 of 1998. The fine defence put up by counsel to support his submission that the defendants’ conduct was not sinister, created instead the ironic effect of emphasising the incongruity between the defence and the evidence. I am satisfied that the plaintiff had proved his case sufficiently. There will therefore be judgment against the first, second and third defendants as claimed. Although the fourth and fifth defendants might not have been culpable in the conspiracy or involved in the defrauding of the company’s creditors, they had not acted diligently as directors to merit any award of costs in their favour, and thus, must each bear his own costs. The plaintiff’s costs shall be paid by the first, second and third defendants.",2006-01-18 00:00:00,SG High Court

RESPONDENT.

PRESENT: The Chief Justice, and Ritchie, Strong, Taschereau,
Fournier, and Henry, J. J.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN""S BENCH FOR, LOWER
CANADA (APPEAL SIDE.)

Rape,—Cross Examination of Prosecutrix,—Previous connection
with other,—men,—New
Trial,—Discharge of Prisoner.

The Prosecutrix, in an indictment for rape, was asked in
cross-examination, after she had declared she had not previously had connection
with a man, other than the prisoner, whether she remembered having been in the
milk-house of G with two persons named M, one after the other.

Held,—That the witness may object, or the Judge may, in
his discretion tell the witness she is or she is not bound to answer the
question but the Court ought not to have refused to allow the question to he
put because the Counsel for the prosecution objected to the question.

Held also,—That, since the passing of 32 and 33 Vict.,
ch. 29, sect. 80 repealing so much of oh. 77 of Cons. Stat. L. C. as would
authorize any Court of the Province of Quebec to order or grant a new trial in
any criminal case; and of 32 and 33 Vict. Ch. 36 repealing sect. 63 of ch. 77
Cons. Stat L. C., the Court of Queen's Bench of the Province of Quebec has no
power to grant a new trial, and that the Supreme Court of Canada, exercising
the ordinary appellate powers of the Court, under sects. 38 and 49 of 38 Vict.,
oh. 11, should give the judgment which the Court whose judgment is appealed
from ought to have given, viz.: to reverse the judgment which has been given,
and order prisoner's discharge.

The prisoner was convicted of rape at the sittings of the
Court of Queen's Bench for the Province of Quebec held in the month of October
last before the Honorable Mr. Justice Plamondon, one of the Judges of
the

[Page 118]

Superior Court for the Province of Quebec at the Village of
Arthabaskaville, in the District of Arthabaska.

At the trial, the Prosecutrix Philomène Michaud, on her
cross-examination, after having described the details of the violence committed
on her person by the prisoner declared that it was the first time she had had
carnal connection with a man.

This statement was made by her, without objection on her part
or on the part of the Crown prosecutor.

In reply to another question she answered, that she was
acquainted with D'Assise Malhoit and Baptiste Malhoit. She was then asked the
question, ""Do you remember your being in the milk-house of Clovis Guilmette
with the two Malhoits, one after the other?""

The Crown prosecutor objected to this question as illegal, and
the Court sustained the objection.

Joseph Provencher was a witness called for the defence. The
prisoner's Counsel proposed to ask him the following question, ""Did you
ever see Philomène Michaud with D'Assise Malhoit and Baptiste Malhoit? If you
have, please state on what occasion, and what they were doing?"" The Court
refused to allow the question as illegal.

The Court in the conflict of decisions on the matter in the
English Courts reserved for the consideration of the Court of Queen's Bench,
for he Province of Quebec, in appeal, the question of the legality of the two
questions, and requested the opinion of the Court in regard thereto.

The Court deferred pronouncing judgment on the verdict
rendered against the Defendant and ordered him to be imprisoned in the common
gaol of the district until the first day of the next term for the sitting of
the Court to receive judgment, or until otherwise discharged according
to law.

[Page 119]

The matter came before the Court of Queen's Bench. for the
Province of Quebec, on the appeal side,
Present:—Monk, Ramsay, Sanborn, and
Tessier, J.J. sitting in the City of Quebec, on the 15th December, 1876;
and they rendered judgment, affirming the ruling of the Judge at the trial;
Ramsay, J., dissenting as to the ruling on the first question.

The Defendant appealed from that decision under the 49th
section of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act .

3rd February, 1877. 

THE CHIEF JUSTICE .
The case of Rex v. Hodgson ([19]); is
the leading case on the subject. The prisoner was convicted before Baron Wood
at the Yorkshire Summer Assizes, in the year 1811, for committing a rape on
Harriet Holliday.

[Page 120]

After the prosecutrix had given her evidence in support of the
prosecution, she was cross-examined by the prisoner's counsel, who put these questions to her.

Whether she had not before had connection with other persons
and whether she had not before had connection with a particular person named. The counsel for the prosecution
objected that she was not obliged to answer these questions, but it was
contended by the prisoner's counsel that in a case of rape she was. - The
learned Judge allowed the objection on the ground that the witness was not
bound to answer these questions as they tended to criminate and disgrace
herself, and said that he thought there was not any exception to the rule in a
case of rape.

The prisoner's counsel called witnesses, and amongst others
offered a witness to prove that the girl had been caught in bed about a year
before this charge with a young man, and offered the young man to prove he had
had connection with her.

The counsel for the prosecution objected to the admissibility
of this sort of evidence of particular facts not connected with the present
charge, as they could not come prepared to answer them. The case was first
considered on the 2nd December, 1811, by all the Judges (except Mansfield, C.
J., Macdonald, C. B., Grose, J, and Lawrence, J., who were absent), and was
postponed for consideration to Hilary term, 30th January, 1812, when, all the
judges being present, they determined that both the objections were properly
allowed.

If we look closely at the statement of the case, we will see
that the objection taken on the questions being asked her was that she was
not obliged to answer those questions, not that she could not be asked
them; and the learned judge allowed the
objection on, the ground

[Page 121]

that the witness was not bound to answer these
questions as they tended, to criminate and disgrace herself. All that the
Judges decided in that case was, that both objections were properly allowed.

In Reg. v. Robins, ([20]);
before Coleridge, J., in 1843, the prosecutrix having denied on
cross-examination that she had had connection with several men who were named,
and who were brought into Court and shewn to her at the time she was questioned
the counsel for the defence called these persons to prove they had had
connection with her.

Greenwood, for the prosecution, objected that such evidence
was inadmissible, and cited Rex v. Hodgson, and referred to Rex
v. Barker, ([21]); and Rex
v. Martin, ([22]).
Coleridge, J., after consulting Erskine, J. said neither he nor that learned
Judge had any doubt on the question. It is not immaterial to the question
whether the prosecutrix has had this connection against her consent, to show
that she has permitted other men to have connection with her which on her
cross-examination, she has denied.

This case does not seem to be sustained by the subsequent
decisions.

The case of Rex v. Barker
([23]) went
to show that the prosecutrix was a common prostitute, and such evidence had
long been held to be material

The case of Rex v. Martin, ([24]);
was tried before Mr. Justice Williams in 1834. The prisoner’s counsel proposed
to ask the prosecutrix whether on the Whit Sunday before the alleged offence,
the prisoner, Aaron Martin, had not had intercourse with her by her own consent

[Page 122]

The counsel for the prosecution objected to the question, and
relied on Rex v. Hodgson, and Rex v. Clarke ([25]). Williams
J., said he was one of the counsel in R. v. Hodgson. The question in the
present case was as to previous intercourse with the prisoner, and the question
there was as to intercourse with other men. He received the evidence and added:
""I must say that I never could understand the case of Rex v. Hodgson.
The doctrine that you may go into general evidence of bad character of the
prosecutrix, and yet not cross-examine as to specific facts, I confess, does
appear to me to be not quite in strict accordance with the general rules of
evidence.""

In Rex v. Clarke, ([26]); in 1817,
Holroyd J., said: "" It is clear that no evidence can be received of
particular facts, and such evidence could not have been received, although the
prosecutrix had been cross-examined as to those facts because her an sewers
upon those facts must have been taken as conclusive. With respect to such facts
the case is clear. Then with respect to general evidence; such evidence has
been held admissible in all cases where character is in issue, and, therefore,
the only question is whether the character of the prosecutrix is involved in
the present issue. In the case of an indictment for a rape, evidence that the
woman had a bad character previous to the supposed commission of the offence is
admissible but the Defendant cannot go into evidence of particular facts.

Rex v. Clay ([27]).
Evidence of the general character of the prosecutrix was admitted, such as that
she had been reputed a prostitute, by
Patterson J. At first he

[Page 123]

was disinclined to allow the evidence, but on referring to the
case of Rex v. Barker, he admitted it.

In Rex v. Dean, ([28]);
prosecutrix had been examined about stealing from a former mistress. Her
mistress had lost 15s. Burrows, a constable, searched her box, she snatched a
parcel containing 15s from the box. When asked to account for the possession,
in her examination, she said she had told Burrowes, a gentle man had given her
the 15s for insulting her; she said:. "" I did not say it was for having
connection with me."" It was proposed to call Burrowes to contradict her.
Platt, B., after consulting Wightman, J., said that Wightman, J., said he could
not call the constable to contradict the statement of the prosecutrix as to her
general character he might call him or other witnesses.

Verry v. Watkins, ([29]).
In an action for seduction, the Plaintiff's daughter was cross-examined to shew
her general bad character in respect of chastity and moral conduct. Alderson
held the Defendant might call evidence as to particular acts of unchastely The
question of damages, in such a case, would be affected by the want of chastity.

Andrews v. Askey, ([30])
In an action for seduction it was held that the Defendant could not contradict
the witness as to statements about the paternity of the child until she had
been asked in the witness box if she had made such statements.

Regina v. Cockroft, ([31]).
The prosecutrix was asked whether she had ever had connection before with other
men. She declined to answer the question Willes, J. said the prosecutrix need
not answer the question unless she likes: ""You may cross-examine

[Page 124]

the prosecutrix with respect to particular acts with. other
men, but if she denies them then you are bound by her answer. You may not call
those men to contradict her. You may however examine her with respect to
particular acts of connection with the prisoner, aud if she denies them, you
may call witnesses to contradict her.""

On a former trial of the same prisoner when the ""jury did
not agree Martin Baron was referred to Reg. v. Robins. His
Lordship said he considered the decision,
in the case cited, wrong and so would not allow a witness to be called to prove
particular acts of connection between the prosecutrix and other men.

These were the principal cases decided in the English Courts
when the case of the Queen v. Holmes was considered, ([32]).

In that case, the prosecutrix, in her cross-examination, was
asked by the prisoner's counsel if she had had connection with Robert Sharp and
she denied it. The prisoner's counsel called Robert Sharp and asked him if the
prosecutrix had ever had connection with him hut the counsel for the prosecution objected to the question on the
authority of Reg. v. Cockroft, and the Court refused to allow the
question to be answered, and reserved the question for the decision of the
Court of Crown cases reserved.

The prisoner's counsel contended the evidence tendered was
strictly relevant to the issue, as having material bearing upon the probability
of the prosecutrix's consent. For the prosecution it was contended that the
question put to the prisoner was not relevant to the issue, it only went to credit. Upon principle, therefore,
her answer is binding. Kelly, C. B., in his

[Page 125]

judgment, considers the question as on a collateral point, and
the answer given must be taken for better or for worse and that evidence to
contradict the witness on the collateral point was not admissible. I If such
evidence were admitted, the whole history of the prosecutrix's life might be
gone into; if a charge might be made as to one man, it might be made as to
fifty, and that without notice to the
prosecutrix. It would not only involve a multitude of collateral issues, but an
inquiry into matters as to which the prosecutrix might be wholly unprepared,
and so work great injustice. Upon’ principle we must hold that the answer is
binding.

On referring to Rex v. Hodgson, he said it was
an actual decision that the prosecutrix, on a charge of rape, was not bound to
answer such a question as that here put. He then refers to the second objection
taken as raising the very point before them, and
the decision being in accordance with the view that the Court took. He referred
to the authorities and shewed the only one against Rex v. Hodgson was
Reg. v. Robins, which they declined to follow, and cited Reg. v
Cockroft as an authority supporting his view.

Pigott, B., said he thought the evidence proposed to be given,
not relevant to the issue and its admission, might lead to great injustice.
Hannen, J., said Rex v. Hodgson was a decision that such evidence
could not be given as substantial evidence in the cause and be regarded as
relevant to the issue, but only as going to the credit of the witness.
The witness's answer is therefore binding; and the reason is that the
prosecutrix cannot come prepared to try all the issues which would be thus
raised

In Starkie on Evidence, ([33]):
the question is considered;

[Page 126]

and it is stated, as the result of the authorities, that it is
perfectly well settled that the credit of a witness
can be impeached by general evidence only, and not by evidence as to
particular, facts not relevant to the issue, for this would cause the enquiry
which ought to be simple and confined to matters in issue, to branch out into
an indefinite number of issues, 

Questions put to witness himself upon cross-examination are not, it may be observed, open
to this objection since his answer is conclusive as to all collateral matters.

In Phillips on Evidence, ([34]);
the question is referred to as follows:—"" In criminal matters, evidence of
character frequently affords a material presumption in regard to the
perpetration of offences. Thus, when the charge is that of rape the general bad
character of the prosecutrix may, under the circumstances of particular cases,
afford a just inference as to the probability of her having consented to the
commission of the act for which the prisoner is indicted. Accordingly, upon the
trial of indictments for such offences, evidence is admissible on 'the part of
the prisoner, that the woman bore a notoriously bad character for want of
chastity and common decency. It appears also that, at least in trials for rape
evidence is admissible that the woman had been before criminally connected with
the prisoner. But it seems that the evidence of particular facts cannot, in
general, be received to impeach the chastity of the woman, as that, previously
to the commission of the offence she had a criminal connection with other
persons. It has been held that the woman, in a prosecution for rape, is not
bound to answer questions tending to criminate and disgrace herself, as,
whether

[Page 127]

she had not before connection with other persons or with a
particular person.""

In a note the learned
author refers to the ruling of Mr.. Justice Holroyd in Reg. v. Clarke,
that the woman's an swers as to particular facts would be conclusive, and
adds, but it is to be observed that this is treating the question as merely
discrediting the witness and not as relevant to the issue, and in Rex. v.
Hodgson, on the alleged ground that the prosecutrix could not be
prepared to answer evidence of particular facts. Perhaps it may be considered
that the question of the woman's chastity is not directly in issue upon such
charges as it is in actions for crim, con. and seduction. The
determination of this question may, however, afford a material inference as to
the truth of the charge, and referring to the questions in Rex v. Hodgson,
he adds: ""It may be observed that the questions do not merely tend to
discredit the witness but are also relevant to the issue."" In the same
work at p. 914, reference is again made to the subject, on an indictment for
rape, the woman is not bound to answer whether, on some former occasion,
she had not a criminal connection with other men or with particular
individuals, and Hodgson's case was again referred to.

Whether questions of such a description may not be legally
asked is a very different question from that before considered, whether the
witness is compellable to answer. It may be just to allow a witness the
privilege of not answering in certain
cases; but that the party against whom the witness appears shall not be allowed
to ask the question, and force him to his privilege, is a proposition which, if
carried into practice, might often be attended with unsatisfactory
consequences.

[Page 128]

Mr. Taylor in work on Evidence, ([35]); says:
"" It is said the prosecutrix in a rape case might be cross-examined with a view of showing that she had
been guilty of incontinence with the Defendant, or even with other men, or with
some particular person, and when she had denied the facts imputed, witnesses
have been called for the purpose of contradiction.""

In a note it is said the
cases cited seem to overrule Rex v. Hodgson, and at page 318, of
the same edition, in a note referring to Rex v. Hodgson, it is
said this case seems to be overruled.

In Best, on Evidence, ([36]);
the matter is referred to as follows: "" When the female prefers a charge
of rape or of assault with intent to commit rape, she brings the question of
her own chastity so far in issue that it is competent for the accused to give
general evidence of her bad character in this respect, or even to show that she
has been criminally connected with himself; but the authorities are
conflicting, whether he will be allowed to prove particular acts of unchastely
with other men.

In Taylor, on Evidence, ([37]);
it is laid down when the witness is not compellable to answer, the privilege is
his, and counsel in the case will not be
permitted to make the objection. Nor is the Judge, it would seem, bound to warn
the witness of his right to demur to the question though in the exercise of his
discretion he may occasionally deem it right to do so.

At p. 1137, sec. 1314, the propriety of allowing witness the
privilege to decline answering questions not directly material to the issue but
which affect his character is discussed
and the propriety of the rule is doubted. The section concludes: ""No doubt
cases may.

[Page 129]

arise when the Judge, in the exercise of his discretion, would
very properly interpose to protect the witness from unnecessary and unbecoming
annoyance. For instance, all inquiries into discreditable transactions of a
remote date, might in general be rightly suppressed, for the interest of
justice seldom require that the errors of a man's life long since repented of
and forgiven by the community should be recalled to remembrance at the pleasure
of any future litigant; so questions
respecting alleged improprieties of conduct which furnish no real ground for
assuming that a witness who would be guilty of them would not be a man of
veracity, might very fairly be checked."" And by sec. 1315: "" But the
rule of protection should not be further extended, for if the inquiry relates
to transactions comparatively recent, bearing directly upon the moral
principles of the witness and his present character for veracity it is not easy
to perceive why he should be privileged from answering, notwithstanding the
answer may disgrace him. It has, indeed been termed a harsh alternative to
compell a witness either to commit perjury or destroy his own reputation, but,
on the other hand, it is obviously most important that the jury should have the
means of ascertaining the character of the witness, and of thus forming
something like a correct estimate of the value of his evidence. Moreover, it
seems absurd to place the mere feelings of a profligate witness in competition
with the substantial interests of the parties in the cause.""

I have made these references, perhaps at greater length than
necessary, to shew the views that prevailed on the subject before the decision
of Regina v. Holmes. One of the learned Judges in the Court of
Queen's Bench inclined to the opinion that the allowing
the question to be put was a matter in the discretion of

[Page 130]

the Judge. I understand the discretion referred to is as to
compelling witness to answer the questions. It seems to me the party has a
right to put the question, and the Judge
will, in his discretion, decide whether he will compel the witness to answer.

When the object is to discredit the testimony of the witness,
to show him to be of a disreputable character, there are conflicting
authorities as to the right of the witness to refuse to answer. Generally, the
question may be asked but when it is not material to the issue, and the object
is merely to degrade the character of the witness, he is not compellable to
answer. Of course the Judge decides, when the witness claims the privilege,
whether he may exercise it or not.

When the prisoner admits the improper connection, but contends
that it was with the consent of the prosecutrix the fact that she had had connection with other men at no distant time
would, to the unprofessional mind, seem a fact proper to go to the jury, and
relevant to the question whether the connection complained of was against her
will or not.

 Were it nor for the last decision on the subject, so
recent as 1871, in the Queen v. Holmes, I should have thought the
question more relevant to the issue than as merely affecting the credit of the
witness, but that case is expressly on. the point that such is the nature of
the question, and I think we ought not to
depart from that decision. But, as already intimated, the right to put the
question is an important one, of which the prisoner ought not to be deprived,
and though, if answered by the prosecutrix, and the answer were false, he could
not call witnesses to contradict her, yet she might answer truly, and, if she
so answered, it might be of service to him. The question, as reported

[Page 131]

in this case by the learned Judge, is not, in terms, asking
her if she had had improper connection with the other men named but that was the object of it and seems to be its
effect; and it was argued in the Court of Queen's Bench, and in this Court,
properly, I think, in that view.

On the whole then I come to the conclusion that the weight of
authority and the course of practice by the Judges in England, is to permit
questions of the kind objected to by the prosecuting officer, to be asked of a witness on cross-examination in cases of rape
that the prosecuting officer is not permitted to raise the objection; the
witness not being bound to answer the question. The witness may object, or the
Judge may tell the witness she is not obliged to answer, if he thinks proper,
though not bound to do so, and the Judge will decide whether the witness is
obliged to answer or not, when the point is raised.

In this case, the Judge, having ruled on the objection taken
by the prosecuting officer, that the question was illegal and could not be put, the prisoner was deprived of a legal
right which he wished to exercise, and we cannot say that the refusal to allow
the question to be put has not prejudiced his case.

If the witness had answered the question which the prisoner's
counsel wished to put in the negative the case of Regina v. Holmes referred to is an express authority
that she could not have been contradicted. Therefore, the ruling of the learned
Judge rejecting that evidence tendered for the prisoner was correct when it was
tendered as relevant to the issue in the cause.

As we are all of opinion that the conviction cannot be
sustained, the next question is whether we have power to grant a new trial.

[Page 132]

Just before the passing of the Statute 32-33 Vic. ch. 29, the
provisions of ch. 113, Con. S., U. C., intituled: ""An Act respecting new
trials and appeals and writs of error in criminal cases in Upper Canada""
were in full force.

The Act provided that when any person had been convicted of
any treason, felony, &c, such person might apply for a new trial, upon any
point of law or question of fact, in as ample a manner as any person might
apply to the Superior Courts of Common Law for a new trial in a Civil action

If the conviction was affirmed by the Superior Court the
person convicted might appeal to the Court of Error and Appeal, provided the
appeal was allowed by the Superior Court,
or any two Judges thereof, and any rule or order of the Court of Appeal was to
be final.

The Court to which the application for a new trial was made
either in the first instance or by way of appeal, were to have power to
determine the questions of law and fact
involved in the application and were to ""affirm the conviction or order a
new trial or otherwise, as justice requires.""

In case of a new trial being granted, the same proceedings as
to any future trial, or the commitment or bailing of the person convicted, as
if no conviction had taken place. In case
of a new trial being refused, the Court were to make such order for carrying
out the sentence already passed, or for passing sentence if none had been
passed, or for the discharge of the person so convicted, on bail or otherwise,
as justice requires.

Ch. 112 of the same statutes provided that when any person
convicted of treason, felony, &c, before any Court of Oyer and Terminer * 
*  *  * the Judge before whom the case was tried, might in his discretion

[Page 133]

reserve any question of law which arose on the trial for the
consideration of the Justices of either of the Superior Courts of Common Law.
The Judge thereupon, was to state in the case the question or questions of law
reserved with the special circumstances upon which the same arose which was to
be transmitted to one of the Superior Courts.

The Justices of the Court to which the case was transmitted
were to hear and finally determine the said questions and reverse, affirm or
amend any judgment given on the indictment or inquisition on the trial whereof
the question arose, or to avoid such judgment or order an entry to be made on
the record that in the judgment of the said Justices the party convicted ought
not to have been convicted or arrest judgment, or if no judgment had been
given, should order judgment to be given thereon at some future session of Oyer
and Terminer or Gaol Delivery *  *  * or make such other order as justice might
require. The judgment was to be certified to the Clerk of Assize who was to
enter the same on the record in the proper form. If the judgment was reversed,
avoided or arrested, the person convicted was to be discharged from further
imprisonment.

Under Cons. Statutes L. C. Ch. Sects. 57 58 and 59 similar
provisions were made for reserving questions of law on a conviction for treason
felony, &c, for the consideration of the Court of Queen's Bench which arose
on the trial. The case is to be transmitted to the Clerk of Appeals. The Court
of Queen's Bench, on the appeal side, to have full power to hear and finally determine
every question therein and thereupon to reverse, amend or affirm any judgment
which has been given on the indictment or inquisition on the trial,

[Page 134]

whereof such question arose, or to avoid such judgment, and to
order an entry to be made on the record, that in the judgment of the Court of
Queen's Bench the party convicted ought not to have been convicted or to arrest
the judgment *  *  *  * or to make such other; rule as justice
requires. The judgment to be certified to the Clerk of the Court from which it
came, who is to enter the same on the record in the proper form. If the
judgment has been reversed, avoided or arrested, the sheriff or gaoler shall
forthwith discharge the prisoner.

By sec. 63, if in any criminal case either reserved as aforesaid
or brought before it by writ of error, the Court of Queen's Bench is of opinion
that the conviction was bad from some
cause not depending upon the merits of the case, it may by its judgment declare
the same and direct that the party convicted be tried again as if no trial had
been had in such case.

The Statute 32 and 33 Vic, ch. 29 sec. 80 repealed so much of
ch. 113 of the Cons. Stat, for U. C. as allowed an appeal to the Court of Error
and Appeal in any criminal case where the conviction had been affirmed by
either of the Superior Courts of Common Law on any question of law reserved for
the opinion of such Court as regarded any conviction after that Act came in force, and the judgment of the Superior
Court on any question reserved should be final and conclusive and so much of
ch. 113 of the said Cons Stat U. C. C. or of ch. 77 of Cons. Stats. L. C. or of
any other Act as would authorise any Court in the Province of Ontario or of
Quebec to order or grant a new trial in any criminal case were repealed as regards
any conviction after that Act came into force and no writ of error was to be
allowed in any criminal case unless

[Page 135]

founded on some question of law which, could not have been
reserved, or which the Judge presiding at the trial refused to reserve for the
consideration of the Court having jurisdiction in such cases. But nothing in
the Act was to prevent the subsequent trial of the offender for the same offence in any case where the conviction is
declared bad for any cause which made the former trial a nullity so that there
was no lawful trial in the cause.

Under ch. 36 of 82 and 33 Vict., ch. 113 of Cons. St. U. C.
was repealed, except sects. 5,16 and 17, which do not relate to the granting of
new trials, and sec. 63 of ch. 77 Cons.
Stats. L. C. was also repealed.

The effect of these repealing statutes is to take away the
power of granting new trials in criminal cases and leaves the law applicable to
Ontario and Quebec de pending upon the
provisions of the Con. Stat. U. C., ch. 112, and Con. Stat. L. C, ch,. 77,
sects 57, 58, 59 as to reserving questions at the trial for the consideration
of the Court as the same may be affected by 80 sect, of 82-33 Vict., and by the
49 sect, of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act , which, so far as applicable to
the matter under consideration, is to the following effect;— ""Any person convicted
of treason, felony or misde meanor before any Court of Oyer and Terminer or
Gaol Delivery, or before the Court of Queen's Bench, in the Province of Quebec,
on its Crown side or before any other Superior Court of criminal jurisdiction,
whose conviction has been affirmed by any Court of last resort or in the
Province of Quebec by the Court of Queen's Bench on its Appeal side *  *  *  *
may appeal to the Supreme Court against the affirmation of such conviction * 
*  *  * and the said Court shall make such rule or order therein either

[Page 136]

in affirmance of the conviction, or for granting a new trial
or otherwise *  *  *  * as the justice of the case requires, and shall make all
other necessary rules and orders for
carrying such rule or order into effect, anything in the 80th section of the
Act passed in the session held in the thirty-second and thirty-third years of
Her Majesty's reign, ch. 29, to the contrary notwithstanding. Provided that no
such appeal shall be allowed where the Court affirming the conviction is
unanimous, nor unless notice of appeal in writing has been served on the
Attorney-General for the proper province within fifteen days after such
affirmance or refusal.""

The object of the Statute 32 and 33 Vict., chap. 29 sec. 80
taken in connection with the Statute chap. 36 of the same Session, repealing
the provisions of the Statutes allowing new trials in criminal cases in Ontario
and Quebec, seems clearly to have been to prevent in these Provinces new trials
in criminal cases and to leave questions of law to be decided on reserved cases as was and is the practice in
England. Looking at the numerous Acts affecting the criminal law passed in that
Session, it was, no doubt, after deliberation, determined to make this
important change in the law then existing in the two Provinces on the subject.

In that view there would be no doubt, I apprehend, that, under
a reserved case, on a question like this, stated under the direction of the
Court when we are of opinion that the ruling of the learned Judge at the trial
was wrong our duty would be to declare that the prisoner ought not to have been
convicted and on that being certified to the proper officer, the prisoner would
be discharged from custody.

The question now to be considered is whether the

[Page 137]

Dominion Parliament, when allowing an appeal to the Supreme Court from the decision of the Provincial
Courts on a case reserved, intended to change the law so as to authorize new
trials to be granted by this Court when such right did not exist in the
Provincial Court if they entertained the same view of the law which this Court
does. I do not think such was the intention of the Dominion Parliament.

If it were not for the words ""and the said Court shall
make such rule or order either in affirmance of the conviction or for granting
a new trial or otherwise as the justice of the case
requires,"" I should say this Court had no power to grant a new trial on an
appeal in a criminal case brought here when the judgment of the Court below is
reversed on the ground of the Judge who tried the case having, contrary to law,
refused to admit evidence offered on behalf of the prisoner.

If the Court of Queen's Bench for the Province of Quebec had
decided in this matter that the prisoner ought not to have been convicted, and
had ordered an entry to be made to that effect on the record it seems to me the
person having the prisoner in custody should forthwith discharge; him from
imprisonment. Then, is it not absurd that, on an appeal alleging that the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench was
incorrect on one of the questions reserved, if we are of opinion that the Court
decided wrong, that the effect should be different from what it would have been
if they had decided correctly.

In exercising the ordinary appellate powers of the Court this
Court under sec. 38 of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act  are to give the
judgment which the Court whose judgment is appealed from ought to have given.
Here, we think, the judgment

[Page 138]

which should have been given by the Court appealed from was to
have reversed not affirmed the conviction and not to grant a new trial, for under the law, as it now stands,
they had no power to do so

This man has been put in jeopardy by this trial, for an
offence which is still a capital felony, and he has been convicted, perhaps
because the learned Judge refused to allow him to ask a certain question of the
prosecutrix. Therefore, the conviction, being bad, cannot be sustained, and he
ought not again to be put in jeopardy by us, unless there is express authority
given us to place him in that position. In the present state of legislation
upon the subject, and the uniform practice, as far as I am advised not to have
a venire de novo awarded in treason or felony when on a case reserved
the Court decides in favor of a criminal I think we should not make an order
for the affirmance of the conviction or for granting a new trial, but “otherwise”
that our order should be to reverse the judgment which has been given on the
indictment and order the prisoner's discharge.

As I have already stated, I do not think that by the clause in
the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act  referred to the Dominion Parliament
intended this Court to grant new trials in cases of treason or felony when
questions were reserved by a Judge at the trial for the consideration of a
Superior Court unless such right existed independent of such section; and as it does not now exist in Quebec
by virtue of any other law, as far as I am advised, this Court ought not to
order a new trial.

In any event there must be grave doubts if such a power exists
and we are authorised to make an order “otherwise"" than affirming
the conviction or granting a new trial. We obey the Statute, and do what
""the justice of the case requires "" by reversing the judgment

[Page 139]

which, has been given in the matter by the Court of Queen's
Bench.

I may here observe that the provisions as to cases reserved
for the consideration of the Court for Crown cases reserved in England under Imp. Stat. 11 & 12 Vict. ch.
78 are the same in effect as those contained in the Cons. Stat. U. C. ch. 112
& Cons. Stat. L. C. ch. 77, the 86 sect, of the latter Statute being
repealed as to reserving cases for the consideration of the Superior Courts of
Law in Ontario, and of the Court of Queen's Bench in Quebec.

RITCHIE, J.:—

I think the conclusion to be arrived at from a consideration
of all the authorities is 'that the prisoner's counsel had a legal right to put the first question objected to,
and rejected by the learned Judge, and that the counsel for the prosecution had
no right to object to the question; that if the witness herself objected to
answer, I think it was in the discretion of the Judge to compel an answer; and that
on the question being put, it was discretionary with the Judge to intimate to
the witness that she might or might not answer it.

I think the answer of the witness when given must be accepted,
and is not open to be contradicted by evidence on the part of the prisoner.

Under the peculiar circumstances of this case viz: of
prisoner's contention, as admitted on the argument, that the connection was
with consent and in view of the witness having, without objection, answered
generally that the connection complained
of was the first time any person had had carnal connection ""with her, it
became, in my opinion, practically very important

[Page 140]

that the prisoner should have been allowed to sift the witness
as to the accuracy of such previous connection by putting the question proposed.

It is right, I think, to say that the witness does not appear
to have objected to the question, or to have been at all unwilling to answer
it, and it is obvious, had the
prosecuting counsel not objected, and the Judge had not ruled the question out,
she might have been only too glad to avail herself of the opportunity of
denying the imputation and of vindicating her character, thus, by the question
proposed, inferentially assailed. Be this as it may, I think on a trial jeopardizing
the life of the prisoner, as this did, he was deprived of a right the law gave
him, and was thereby prevented from making full defence and therefore without
attempting an inquiry into the extent of the injury he sustained, or
speculating on the benefits he might or might not have received by the
answering or refusing to answer the question when propounded, I think it
sufficient to say the law gave the prisoner the right to put the question, and
the learned Judge having deprived him of that right his trial was not according
to law, and his conviction on such a trial cannot be sustained.

STRONG, J.:—

I am of opinion that the learned Judge who tried the case
ought to have permitted the prisoner's counsel, on the cross-examination of the prosecutrix, to put the
question which was objected to by the Crown Counsel and that the Counsel for
the prosecution had no right to interpose the objection which he made to it.
The result of the English authorities is, that the question was one which might
be put to test the credit of the witness but that the prosecutrix

[Page 141]

might if she objected to answer it, in the discretion of the
Judge, be excused from doing so, on the ground that it tended to degrade and
harass her.

It is said by a text writer of high authority on the law of
evidence ([38])
that cases may arise where the Judge, in the exercise of his discretion, would
very properly interpose to protect the witness from unnecessary and unbecoming
annoyance."" Another author of repute, Best on Evidence, ([39]) lays it down
that though in strictness the Courts can compel a witness to answer such a
question; yet, in their discretion, they will not do so, as the end of the
cross-examination is obtained by putting the question and the refusal of the
witness to answer. These writers state I think, correctly the conclusion from
reported cases. Here, however, the learned Judge did not permit the question to
be put, and, therefore, deprived the prisoner not only of the chance of
obtaining an affirmative answer, but also of the obvious practical advantage
which might have resulted to him from a refusal to answer. Had the question
been put, and the witness, on claiming protection herself been excused from
answering, the exercise of discretion of the Judge could not be reviewed on a case
reserved under the Statute, but must have been considered as conclusive.

Formerly there existed in England a reason for according to a
witness an absolute privilege from answering such a question as that propounded
to the prosecutrix, inasmuch, as a party guilty of an act of incontinence could
have been made liable to penal consequences by a prosecution in the
Ecclesiastical Court. This reason it seems, never had any force in the Province
of Quebec, and it has long ceased to exist in England; though in

[Page 142]

1812, when Rex v. Hodgson, ([40])
was decided .it was applicable, and appears to have been one of the grounds of
the decision, for Baron Wood there held the witness not bound to answer as it
tended to criminate her.

As to the question which was put to the witness Provencher,
that was, without doubt, properly overruled on the authority of Reg, v. Cockroft
([41]), and Reg.
v. Holmes, ([42]) and
upon the very well settled principle that a witness cannot be contradicted in
matters foreign to the issue which on the trial of this indictment was as Mr.
Justice Ramsay points out, not whether the prosecutrix was unchaste, but
whether the prisoner had had connection with her by violence.

The proper order to be made on the present appeal will, I
think, be to reverse the judgment of the Court below, to direct the conviction
to be quashed and the prisoner to be discharged. A new trial is out of the
question, for Section 38 of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act  directs that
this Court shall, in the alternative of a reversal, give the judgment which the
Court below ought to have given, and since the repeal of Section 63 , ch. 77 of
the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada, the Court of Queen's Bench could not
have granted a new trial. Section 49 of the Supreme Court Act which authorizes
this Court to grant a new trial must be read such a way as to make it
consistent with section 38 already referred to, and this requires us to hold
that the power to grant new trials is confined to cases in which the Court
appealed from could have made such an order.

[Page 143]

TASCHEREAU, J.:—

The prisoner was convicted of rape, and he now seeks to be
discharged on the ground that he had not a fair trial, inasmuch as the
presiding Judge excluded material evidence on cross-examination of the private
prosecutrix. The question was ""as to her having been in the dairy of one
Clovis Gruilmette with two men named Malhiot the one after the other.""

I agree with my brother Judges in declaring that the Judge was
wrong in rejecting the question, which was manifestly calculated to affect the
character, and, as a consequence, the credibility of the prosecutrix in a case
of rape where her chastity was in question. For it is an undoubted principle in
criminal cases as in civil cases and now settled by the best and latest
decisions, that any question tending to affect the character, and consequently,
the credibility of a witness, should be allowed. As to her refusal to answer
the question, if it had been allowed by the Judge, I have nothing to say at the
present moment; as to the practical result of such a refusal and as to the line
of conduct of the Pre siding Judge under the circumstances, I think we are not
called upon to express any opinion on this subject.

It must also be noted that the prosecutrix had freely declared
that she had had no carnal connection with any man previous to the occasion in
question in this case. I think that by such answer she had, to a certain
extent, challenged a very severe cross-examination, and renounced any privilege
if she had been entitled to claim any. I am, therefore, of opinion that the
ruling of the presiding Judge rejecting the question was wrong, and that the
prisoner should have the benefit of it, and obtain nothing less than his
discharge, in the actual state of the law.

FOURNIER, J.:—Concurred

[Page 144]

HENRY, J.:—

Agreeing as I do with the conclusions of the judgment already
given in this case, on the two points raised and argued, it is unnecessary for
me to make any extended remarks and I will content myself by saying that,
after the best consideration I have been able to give to the question
submitted, and a consultation of the governing authorities, as well as the
principles and the consequences involved, I have no hesitation in approving the
reasons given by Mr. Justice Ramsay, in the Court of Queen's Bench.

The authorities, without doubt, in my mind, establish the
right of the accused to have the question put, and having been prevented by the presiding Judge from
having that done I consider that his defence was thereby affected, and legal
evidence virtually, though perhaps not technically, rejected.

Upon the second point, as to the rejection of the evidence of
Joseph Provencher, there ought not, I think, be any doubt that the ruling of
the presiding Judge was correct.

Having declined to permit the question to be put to the
prosecutrix, it would, independently of previous testimony, be irrelevant to
the issue, and therefore, not admissible and the prosecutrix, not having made
any statement in the point, it could not be received as contradictory.

For the reasons given in the other judgments delivered, I
concur in the view that the prisoner should be discharged. Under the Act
constituting this Court, power is given it to order a new trial in criminal
appeal cases; but, independently of the other reasons given, I at present
entertain doubts as to the

[Page 145]

propriety of our doing so, except in cases where a mistrial
has taken place.

I have advisedly confined
my judgment to the two points raised.

Appall allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

New trial—Verdict for plaintiff—Technical
breach of contract Defendant entitled to nominal damages for.

In an action to recover the balance of the
contract price for work done for the defendant, the declaration also containing
the

[Page 707]

common count for work and labor, the evidence
showed that there was a technical breach of the contract by which, however, the
defendant had sustained no substantial damage. A verdict was found for the
plaintiff and a rule for a new trial was refused by the Divisional Court, and
also by the Court of Appeal.

Held,
affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, that a verdict would not be set
aside merely to enter a verdict for the other party for nominal damages.

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court refusing to set
aside a verdict for the plaintiffs and order a new trial.

This action was brought by the executors of the
late George N. Oille, of St. Catharines, to recover from the appellant the
sum of $14,500, being a balance alleged
to be due by him under a contract in writing and under seal between the said George
N. Oille and the appellant, executed on the 13th day of May, 1881.

Under the contract Oille agreed for the sum of $26,500 to build a compound engine “of the
proportions, quality, style and finish, with furnishings the most complete and
best, and to be provided with cylinder boilers built of the best boiler steel,
and shall have all the requirements, furnishings and attachments complete,
according to the specifications hereunto annexed, said specification to form
and does form part of this agreement, the engines and boilers to be all
finished in every particular, and furnished, setup, and securely and amply
fastened to the steamer now building near the town of Sarnia, on or before the
1st day of March, A.D. 1882.”

The specifications which, as appears above, are
made a part of the contract, commence as follows: “Specifications of a compound
engine and two cylinder boilers to be built by George N. Oille, of the city of
St. Catharines, for James H. Beatty, of the town of Thorold, to be
completed and set up in the vessel

[Page 708]

now being constructed at the town of Sarnia, and
to be in every way finished and furnished with all things necessary and
required for such a style of engine and boilers and description of steamer; the
material used in the engine and boilers shall be of the very best quality and
the work on the most improved and approved plans and best workmanship.”

The appellant’s defence was that default was
made in the completion of the engine; that Oille, in December, 1882, wholly
abandoned the work; that the appellant was then obliged to finish it, and
expended large sums of money in so doing; that by reason of the default of
Oille the engine and boiler were not finished until the opening of navigation
in 1883, and the appellant thus lost the profits which the boat would have
earned in the season of 1882; that the work was performed by Oille in an
unskilful, negligent and careless manner; that large sums had been expended by
the appellant in remedying defects, and that it would be necessary to expend a
still larger amount before the engine and boiler were brought to the standard
called for by the contract; that the moneys expended by the appellant to
complete the engine and boilers and remedy the defects and the loss by the
delay and defective and negligent work were more than the amount of the
plaintiffs claim, and the appellant counter-claimed for the balance.

The case came on before Mr. Justice Armour
and a jury on the 17th and 18th January, 1885.

While the appellant was being examined at the
trial the plaintiffs admitted his right to credit for the moneys expended by
him in completing the work after it had been abandoned as aforesaid, and also a
sum of between $200 and $300 which the
appellant paid in replacing a portion of the machinery in which inferior
material had been used, and the plaintiff’s claim was thus reduced

[Page 709]

to the sum of $9,911.50,
which sum, with interest to the date of the trial, making in all the sum of $10,329, was claimed by the plaintiffs when
the case went to the jury.

The jury brought in a verdict for the plaintiffs
for the sum of $10,329, being the full
amount claimed, and wholly disallowed the claim and counter-claim of the
appellant.

The defendants applied to the Divisional Court
for a new trial, which was refused, and on appeal to the Court of Appeal the
judgment of the Divisional Court refusing the new trial was sustained.

S.H. Blake Q.C. and McDonald Q.C. for the
appellants.

The questions to be decided are: First—Was the
work done according to contract? And secondly—If not, is the defendant entitled
to damages for the non-completion and for the loss of what the vessel would
have earned during the season?

The work was not finished until May, 1883. The
season commences in May and ends in November. The date for completing the
engine, namely, March 1st, was important, as it would leave two months to
complete all arrangements and get the vessel ready by the first of May. The
hull was ready to receive the boiler in December, 1881. The boiler was not
commenced until June, and the engine until September, 1882.

Then the engine when finished was defective. The
reason why the boat was not given a higher speed than 11 or 12 miles an hour
is, that the port or opening into the high-pressure engine from the boiler was
too small. The same mistake was made between the high‑pressure and the
low-pressure engine. The vacuum pipe also was too small and the hot well was so badly constructed that it
burst. A large outlay would be required to remedy these defects and make the
boat fit

[Page 710]

for her business. See Thomson v. South
Eastern Ry. Co.[1].

It is clear that we are entitled to damages for
loss of what would be the ordinary use of what the plaintiff contracted to
supply us with. Cory v. Thames Iron Works and Ship Building Co.[2]; Ex parte Cambrian Steamship Co.[3]; Elbinger Actien Gessellschafft v.
Armstrong[4]; Roscoe’s
Nisi Prius[5];
Benjamin on Sales[6]; Hadley
v. Baxendale[7].

Large profits might have been made out of this
boat. See Fletcher v. Tayleur[8].

Then we are entitled to a new trial on the
ground of misdirection. White v. Crawford[9]
and Hoyt v. Stockton[10] show
that the observations of the judge to the jury on matters of fact will form
ground for a new trial if the jury have been misled by them. See also Maddock
v. Glass[11].

Osler Q.C. and Cox for the respondents

The objections to the judge’s charge were not
made at the trial and should not be considered here.

As to the claim that the engine was defective it
is only necessary to refer to the evidence, which shows that the appellant
tested it on two trial trips and made no objection then nor at any time until
he pat in his counter claim in 1884. The vessel was kept running for a year,
never losing a day, and was sold then for the full cost price, with $4,000 added for his personal superintendence
in her construction.

In answer to the claim for damages for the
non-completion according to contract, it is submitted that the defendant
sustained no substantial injury thereby. The

 [Page 711]

contractor for the hull failed in March, 1882,
with $45,000 of work yet to be done.
There is no evidence that the vessel would have been ready for sea if the
engine and boiler had been furnished. Defendant had no sale for the vessel
until 1883, and could have done nothing with her before.

The following authorities were also cited: Canada
Central Ry. v. Murray[12]; Connecticut
Mutual Ins. Co. v. Moore[13]; Cousins
v. Merrill[14]; Reg.
v. Fick[15]; Fitzpatrick
v. Casselman[16].

Sir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.—There does not appear to
have been any misdirection in this case, and no objection was taken to the
judge’s charge. The questions raised were properly for the jury, who found in
favor of the plaintiff with, evidently, the concurrence of the learned judge
before whom the case was tried.

On a motion to the Divisional Court to set aside
the verdict on the ground that the verdict, so far as it was in favor of the
plaintiff on his statement of claim, was against law and evidence and the
weight of evidence, and also so far as it related to the contention of the
defendant, the court were of opinion that the finding of the jury ought not to
be disturbed; that there was no miscarriage in the case upon any question of
law; that there was no objection to the judge’s charge nor any room for
objection; that though the impression on the mind of the learned judge was
favorable to the plaintiff he presented the evidence fairly to the jury, and
that his comments thereon seem to have been fully warranted; that though there
was a technical breach of contract which might have entitled the defendant to
have recovered nominal damages, yet that that was not a ground for interfering
with a verdict when the jury

 [Page 712]

found, as they must be taken to have done in
this case, that substantial damage had not flowed from the breach, at which
conclusion the court thought the jury were fully warranted in arriving;
therefore the court refused to interfere with the verdict.

The defendant appealed from this decision of the
Divisional Court to the Court of Appeal. That court was unanimously of opinion
that though on his counter claim the defendant was in strictness entitled to a
finding in his favor for nominal damages for breach of contract as to the time
appointed for finishing the work, yet the court would not disturb the verdict
on that ground as “for a long series of years the courts have refused to
disturb verdicts merely for the purpose or entering a nominal amount for either
party, where no right was involved and the case sounded wholly in damages.” The
court could not see that there was any misdirection, and concurred generally in
the reasons for judgment in the court below discharging the rule against the
verdict. “The evidence” the court said “was, as usual, rather contradictory as
to the character of the work done by plaintiff, but it was a fair question for the
jury as to whether it fairly answered the contract and specifications,” and the
court would not say that the jury had arrived at an erroneous conclusion, and
they thought it unlikely that any other jury to whom the case should be
submitted would arrive at any different conclusion, and so dismissed the
appeal, and so, I think, must we

I am far from being prepared to say that the
jury and the courts below were wrong in the conclusions at. which they arrived.
On the contrary, had I been on the jury I think I should have arrived at the
same conclusion that the jury did.

FOURNIER, HENRY and TASCHEREAU JJ.—Concurred.

[Page 713]

GWYNNE J.—This action is brought by the
executors of one Oille to recover a balance alleged to be due to them as such
executors upon a contract made by their testator with the defendant for the
construction and fitting of composite engines and boilers in a vessel then
being about to be built by the defendant. The plaintiffs in their statement of
claim alleged the completion of the engines and boilers and the fitting the
same in the vessel, and that after the completion of the vessel they were
found, upon a trial trip, to work satisfactorily, whereupon, as the plaintiffs
alleged, the balance of the contract price amounting to $14,500.00 ($12,000.00
having been paid during the progress of the work) became due and payable to the
plaintiffs, as such executors, with interest. The defendant in his statement of
defence set out the contract whereby it appeared that Oille, in the month of
May, 1881, had agreed with the defendant to construct the engines and boilers
according to specifications annexed to the contract and to set up the same in a
steam vessel then being built by the defendant at the town of Sarnia, on or
before the 1st day of March, 1882, and by the contract it was provided that the
whole of the work on the engines and boilers should be pushed forward so as not
to interfere with or delay the shipbuilders in their work, and that any change
made in material, construction, and furnishing, required by the shipowner or
the inspector, should be consistent with the said contract, and it was thereby
agreed further that when the engines and boilers should be finished and set up
in the vessel and everything finished and requirements met according to the
contract and a satisfactory trial made by a round trip to Duluth and return,
that then the shipowner should pay to the contractor in full of his contract
the full sum of twenty-six thousand five hundred dollars, but that should the
contractor desire it he could draw money during the

[Page 714]

time of completing the contract to the amount of
twelve thousand dollars. The defendant then alleged that Oille failed in
completing the work by the time specified in the contract, and that in the
month of December, 1882, the work being still unfinished, he wholly abandoned
the work and left the same in an unfinished state, and that the work then done
was not done according to the contract, and was unskilfully and
negligently-done and performed, and that after the abandonment of the said work
by Oille the defendant was obliged to complete the same, and thereupon employed
men and obtained materials for the purpose of completing said work, and had
expended in such work and materials the sum of $7,000;
that the said steamer had since the opening of navigation in the year 1883, and
during the seasons of 1883 and 1884, been employed in running between Sarnia
and Duluth, yet that no satisfactory trip had yet been made by reason of the
said engine not working properly or satisfactorily; that the defendant had
expended large sums of money in investigating and endeavouring to ascertain the
defect in the construction of the said engine, and had ascertained that certain
work in the construction of the said engine in the interior thereof was
performed by Oille not according to the specifications in the contract
mentioned, but in an unskilful, careless and negligent manner, which work was,
as the defendant alleged, recently and long after the opening of navigation for
the year 1883, discovered by the defendant; and the defendant claimed that the
plaintiffs’ claim should be dismissed with costs and by way of counter-claim
the defendant claimed that he should be paid by the plaintiffs out of the
assets of the estate of their testator, the said Oille, the damages which the
defendant had sustained by reason of the default of the said Oille in not
completing his said contract according to the terms thereof, and for

[Page 715]

the loss which the defendant had sustained in
being deprived of the earnings of his said steam vessel for the season of 1882,
and for the loss and damage which the defendant had sustained by reason of the
unskilfulness, neglect and careless work performed on said engine, as
aforesaid. The plaintiffs in their reply, among other things, alleged that the
delay in completing the said contract was caused solely by the defendant and
the persons employed by him to construct the hull of the said vessel, and they
alleged further that during the progress of the said contract work the
defendant made frequent changes therein and required the said Oille to alter
the same in many particulars and vary from the said specifications, and also to
do work not provided for by the said specifications, and thereby materially
hindered and delayed the said Oille in his said contract work; and the
plaintiffs submitted that by reason of such the conduct of the defendant, the
said Oille was released from the obligation to complete the said work at the
time specified in the contract; and the plaintiffs further alleged that the
said specifications were prepared and the said engines and boilers and other
work mentioned in the said contract were planned and designed by the defendant,
and he personally superintended the said contract work during the progress
thereof and that the same was done in all respects according to his
instructions and directions, and they further alleged that a satisfactory trial
trip was made after the completion of the said work, and that the defendant was
satisfied therewith and made no complaints whatever respecting the same until
shortly before the commencement of this action, and they denied that the
defendant had suffered any damage whatever by reason of any default of the said
Oille, or that he had sustained any loss whatever for which the said Oille was,
or the plaintiffs as his executors are, respond-

[Page 716]

sible. At the trial before Armour J. it appeared
that the inspector referred to in the contract to superintend for the defendant
the performance of the work was not appointed by the defendant until the latter
end of November, 1881. In a letter of the 21st of that month addressed by the
defendant to Oille, he says:—“I have engaged Mr. Thos. Pettigrew for one
year at $1,000 and board, he to take
charge of the work in your shop till the engine and boiler are completed and
set up, and then he is to take charge of and run the engine till the close of
navigation, and he will be ready to commence work next week. Get your material
and men at once. Should the forging not be ready now, go to Buffalo and see
after it so that there may be no delay, also all patterns and castings. In a
word, the whole work is to be shoved ahead.
I hope you have ordered the strap plates for the horizontal seams as they must
be triple riveted. We have taken measures of the hold and find the distance
from the top of the boiler to the top of the main deck, allowing six inches for
the saddle, to be 23 inches, and the throw down should stand about six inches
above the deck, say whole length, 30 inches between boiler and dome. Now there
is another thing I wish to call your attention to, that is, the absolute
necessity of making provision for a receiver over engine working at right
angles; this could be dispensed with provided the engine worked at opposite centres.
This must be provided without fail. How have you arranged in regard to the
small cylinder where the receiver was intended to be? Can you give me the size
of the engine on which you intend to have the steam lap and exhaust pipe, with
the distance the exhaust pipe will be from the centre of the engine, giving
size of exhaust pipe and the inside and outside measures from centre, This we
want, as we are laying our beams

[Page 717]

and stringers. Please write at once, give the
size and distance of exhaust pipe from cylinder.”

It appeared from the evidence of Pettigrew, who
had thus been engaged by the defendant to superintend the construction of the
engines and to run he vessel when completed, that the defendant himself was
backwards and forwards at the workshop where they were constructed 80 per cent.
of the time during which the work was in progress, and yet during all that time
he does not appear to have ever complained of the delay which had occurred in
the construction of the engines or that the contract therefor had thereby been
broken. He also gave evidence that the vessel made a satisfactory trial trip
when finished, and that she ran 16 trips during the year 1883, during all of
which trips the engines ran very fairly and were successful during the season.
In March, 1883, Oille, the contractor, died, and in June of that year, after
the trial trip, one of the plaintiffs having written him a letter enquiring as
to the working of the engines, the defendant in reply wrote the following
letter, dated June 15th, 1883:—

DEAR SIR,—I have just returned from the
East and found your letter, and beg to state I am not in a position to give you
the desired information respecting the working of the engine of the “United
Empire,” but from the intimation I am inclined to think it does not work
satisfactorily, but will write when I receive the engineer’s full report. There
are several parts that must be supplied with different material, which may
affect the efficiency. It will be some two weeks before I can get this report
from the engineer, when I will correspond with you fully respecting the
efficiency of the engine.

The defendant, however, never did subsequently
correspond with the plaintiffs, or either of them, upon the subject. Pettigrew,
who was the engineer who ran the vessel in 1883, upon this point said that the
defendant applied to him for a report of the working of the engines, and
although he saw the defendant upon the occasion of every trip that the only
thing which passed

[Page 718]

between them upon the subject of the engines was
when laying up the vessel in the fall of the year 1888 the defendant came into
the engine room and said that “there must be something wrong with the engine
because she was not coming up to his expectation, and he asked me what was the
matter. I told him that the proportions of the engines were the same as the
Buffalo engines, and that they did as good work as any boats that were going
across the lakes.”

He added, in his evidence, that he had got a
speed of 11, 12 and 13 miles an hour out of the engines, and that he ran her at
the speed which he found to be most economical for her, which was upon an
average 112 miles per hour. It appeared, also, in evidence that the persons who
had contacted to build the hull for the defendant failed, and in March, 1882,
wholly abandoned their contract, after which time the defendant had to take the
work into his own hands and was obliged to lay out in workmanship and material
the sum of $45,000 to complete the
vessel, of which sum the material which the defendant was obliged to purchase
to complete the vessel cost from $10,000
to $15,000. The contention of the
defendant upon this point was that although the contractors for construction of
the hull did abandon their contract in March, 1882, still that the vessel had
been sufficiently advanced to receive the machinery in the fall of 1881. In
answer to this contention the plaintiffs relied upon the defendant’s letter of
the 21st November, 1881; and, moreover, they contended that even if the jury
should be of opinion that the hull was sufficiently advanced so as to receive
the engines before the 1st March, 1882, still the non-completion of the vessel
so as to engage in the navigation of 1882 was not to be attributed to the delay
in the completion of the engines, but to the delay occasioned by the failure of
the contractors for the construc-

[Page 719]

tion of the hull, and in support of their
contention that the defendant had not been damnified, as he claimed to be, by
the delay in construction of the engines, from not having the use of the vessel
during the period of navigation of 1882, the plaintiffs relied upon the
following which appeared in evidence, namely, that the vessel was built by the
defendant wholly upon the speculation of selling her to a certain company
called the North-West Transport and Navigation Company, of which company the
defendant was the principal stockholder, and that during the whole of the year
1882 that company refused to purchase or to have anything to do with the
vessel, and so the plaintiff contended that it was for the jury to say whether
the defendant had not for this reason taken the whole of the year 1882 to
complete the vessel, and that he was in reality not damnified by the delay
which had taken place in the construction of the engines. Much evidence was
entered into upon the question whether or not the engines and boilers had been
constructed in accordance with the specifications, and as to the sufficiency of
the work to meet the requirements of the contract, by which it was stipulated
that the engines were to be built, according to the specifications annexed,
with furnishings most complete and with cylindrical boilers built of the best
boiler steel. The specifications appeared to have been drawn by the defendant
himself, and not to have been altogether perfect, many things which as was
contended by the defendant were necessary to make the engine complete and
perfect not being specifically mentioned therein. During the examination of one
of the witnesses, an expert, the learned judge before whom the case was tried
made the observation that: “The question is, did this engine fill the
specifications, to begin with, and as far as these specifications do not
specify, was it reasonably fit for the

[Page 720]

purpose for which it was intended?” And he
added: “If the man who ran the engine in 1883, says it is as good an engine as
ever went into a ship, that would be evidence to go to a jury to show that it
was reasonably tit for the work.” No objection appears to have been taken to
the correctness of this view, as to the question before the jury as to the
sufficiency or insufficiency of the engine to meet the contract, the main
ground of insufficiency relied upon by the defendant, was that the speed of the
vessel did not come up to what was expected by him, which was from 13 to 14
miles per hour, and the evidence he relied upon on this point was that of an
expert who had examined the vessel after the close of navigation of the year
1884, and who suggested considerable changes at a very large outlay with the
view of increasing the speed of the vessel. Whether the suggestions made by
this witness were at all necessary and whether the alterations suggested were
required by the contract was the subject of much criticism, and of evidence in
contradiction offered by the plaintiffs, which latter evidence included that of
the witness Pettigrew who inspected the whole of the work until the engines and
boilers were fitted in the vessel, the part taken by the defendant in
completing them being only to advance for materials and work a sum in excess of
the $12,000 agreed to be paid during
the progress of the work. The learned judge no doubt, formed an opinion which
the jury perceived to be unfavorable to the defendant, but he left the case to
the jury with charge to which no objection whatever was taken either for
misdirection or non-direction or for any other cause. Nor was he asked to vary
in any respect upon any point, the manner in which he left the case to the
jury. His direction as to the rule of law as to the measure of damages
applicable in cases of the nature of the present was not

[Page 721]

then nor has it since been objected to. The jury
upon this charge rendered a verdict for the plaintiff of $10,32900 allowing thus to the defendant $4,171.00, to cover all moneys which had been
advanced by the defendant during the progress of the work and certain parts of
the machinery which had proved defective and which had been supplied by the
defendant, but disallowing the defendant’s counter claim for damages for the
delay complained of in the non‑completion of the engines by the 1st of
March, 1882, or otherwise. A rule nisi for a new trial upon the ground of the
verdict being against law and evidence and the weight of evidence, having been
obtained, was, on argument, discharged by the Divisional Court, whose judgment
has been unanimously sustained by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the
defendant has appealed to this court, and in the argument before us the learned
counsel for the defence undertook to establish, which he has failed to do, that
these judgments are clearly erronous. Moore v. The Connecticut Ins. Co.[17] before the Privy Council, is an authority
that even where a verdict is unsatisfactory in the opinion of a court before
which it is reviewed as against law and evidence and the weight of evidence,
which the verdict in this case does not appear to me to be, that is not
sufficient to justify a court in granting a new trial. That in order to be
justified in granting a new trial they must be satisfied that the evidence so
strongly preponderates in favor of the party as to lead to the conclusion that
the jury in finding for the other party have either wilfully disregarded the
evidence or failed to understand or appreciate it. Consistently with this ruling,
which is conclusively binding upon this court, there does not appear to be any
foundation for the contention that the unanimous judgments of two courts

[Page 722]

upon the point in question should be reversed.
The appeal must, therefore, be dismissed with costs.

Appeal dismissed with costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Malicious prosecution—Reasonable and
probable cause—Belief of prosecutor—Duty to make inquiry—Questions for jury.

In an action for malicious prosecution the
existence or non-existence of reasonable and probable cause must be determined
by the court. The jury may be asked to find on the facts from which reasonable
and probable cause may be inferred but the inference must be drawn by the
judge. Lister v. Ferryman (L.R. 4 H.L. 521) followed; Abrath v. North
Eastern Railway Co. (11 Q.B.D. 79, 440; 11 App. Cas. 247) considered.

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court by which a non-suit
at the trial was set aside and a new trial granted.

The defendant is inspector of police for the
city of Toronto who caused plaintiffs to be arrested on a charge of keeping a
house of ill-fame. The information was laid by a woman named Dale who had
boarded with the plaintiffs for a time and plaintiffs claimed that she did so
with a view of regaining possession of her trunks which had been held by
plaintiffs for payment of her bill for board. The case was tried three times,
resulting each time in a non-suit which was afterwards set aside and a new trial
ordered. From the last order defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal, and the
judges of that court being equally divided the order stood confirmed. Defendant
then appealed to this court.

[Page 589]

The principal question raised on the appeal is
whether or not the trial judge should have submitted to the jury questions as
to the defendant’s belief in the truth of the information and as to whether or
not he had made proper inquiries before causing the warrant to issue.

MacLaren Q.C. for the appellant. The
question of want of reasonable and probable cause is for the court alone, and
there were no facts in dispute on which the jury should have passed. See Lister
v. Ferryman[1];
Abrath v. North Eastern Railway Company[2];
Brown v. Hawkes[3].

Tytler for the respondents cited Hamilton
v. Cousineau[4]
and authorities there collected by Hagarty C.J.O.

STRONG J.—This is an action for malicious
prosecution brought by the respondents against the appellant for having caused
their prosecution and arrest on a warrant issued by the police magistrate of
the city of Toronto, on the information of the appellant, on a charge of
keeping a house of ill-fame. The charge was founded on the information of one
Alice Dale, who had been an inmate of the respondents’ house, and who, on the 11th
of October, 1889, furnished to the appellant, who is staff inspector in the
Toronto police force, and as such specially charged with the suppression of
houses of ill-fame, a statement in writing signed by him in the following
words:—

                                                       POLICE
DEPARTMENT, Toronto, Oct. 11th, 1889.

Mrs. John Dale, at present rooming on
Victoria Street, between Queen and Shuter, west side, with a woman who takes in
washing, “Laundry” over door, vs. Mrs. McLaren, of 292 Adelaide Street
West, with whom she (Mrs. Dale) has been rooming for about five

[Page 590]

weeks, from 2nd September to 8th October,
keeping an house of assignation, allowing, and, in fact, soliciting, the
complainant to bring men into the house and pay her fifty cents for use of room
with each man. This she (Mrs. Dale) did on several occasions, giving
Mrs. McLaren fifty cents each time; in addition to this, Mrs. McLaren
made arrangements with Mrs. Dale to go with another man, from whom she
received twenty dollars on four different occasions, and gave Mrs. McLaren
five dollars on three different occasions; and on Mrs. Dale refusing to
give the five dollars on the fourth occasion, she was ordered by
Mrs. McLaren to pack up and leave the house; and she now refuses to give
up Mrs. Dale’s two trunks.

I have had the foregoing read over to me by
Staff Inspector Archibald, and I subscribe to it as being correct.

                                                                          (Signed)          ALICE
DALE.

Upon this information received from Alice Dale
the respondent laid and swore to the following information and complaint:—

CANADA, Province of Ontario, County of
York, City of Toronto, To Wit:

The information and complaint of David
Archibald, of the City of Toronto, staff inspector, taken on oath before me,
George Taylor Denison, Esquire, police magistrate in and for the said city, the
fourteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred
and eighty-nine.

The said informant, upon his oath, saith he
is informed and believes that Mr. and Mrs. Duncan and Margaret
McLaren within the past three months, to wit: on the fifteenth day of July, in
the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and eighty-nine, and on divers
other days and times between that day and the day of the laying of this
information, at the City of Toronto, in the County of York, unlawfully did keep
a certain house of ill-fame at 292 Adelaide Street West, in the said City of
Toronto, contrary to the form of the statute in such cases made and provided.

Complainant prays that a warrant may issue,
and justice be done in the premises.

                                                                           (Signed)        D.
ARCHIBALD.

October, 1889.

[Page 591]

The respondents having been arrested on the
warrant issued on this complaint the charge was heard before the police
magistrate and by him dismissed.

Subsequently to the laying of the information
and before the hearing of the case the appellant was informed by another
inspector of the Toronto force—Inspector Johnston—that he did not think there
was much in Alice Dale’s charge, and also what he had learned upon a visit to
the house, viz., that disturbances which had occurred there and which had
called for the interference of police had been occasioned by quarrels between
the respondents themselves. It is, however, distinctly proven that this
ultimate report from Inspector Johnston was made after the information had been
sworn to.

The action was first tried before
Mr. Justice Street, who gave judgment dismissing the action. This judgment
was set aside by the Common Pleas Division and a new trial was ordered. The
second trial took place before Mr. Justice McMahon, who again non-suited
the plaintiffs. This second judgment having been also set aside by the Common
Pleas Division, a third trial was had before the learned Chief Justice of the
Queen’s Bench, at the Toronto autumn assizes of 1890, who held that the
plaintiffs had failed to prove a want of reasonable and probable cause, and
dismissed the action. From this judgment the respondents again appealed to the
Common Pleas Division who ordered a third new trial. The appellant then
appealed to the Court of Appeal, and the judges of that court being equally
divided in opinion the appeal was dismissed.

From this latter judgment the present appeal has
been taken.

The well known case of Lister v. Ferryman[5] had,

[Page 592]

as I have always supposed, settled the law as
regards D this class of action, to be that the question of reasonable and
probable cause was, although a question of fact, one to be determined by the
court and not by the jury. That in such cases the respective functions of the
trial judge and jury were these, that whilst the jury were to find all the
facts from which the inference was to be drawn, yet that the inference itself,
deducible from those facts, was one to be drawn, not by the jury, but by the
judge.

This is certainly most clearly laid down in the
case of Lister v. Ferryman5, and the apparent anomaly and
exceptional character of the rule by which a question of fact was thus
withdrawn from the jury, who, generally speaking, were judges of the facts, and
left to be decided by the court, occasioned expressions of surprise from some
of the law lords, who, having been trained in courts of equity, or in the
Scottish tribunals, had not been practically familiar with such questions. It
has, however, been suggested in a little book written by Mr. Stephens, on
the law of Malicious Prosecutions, that this rule of Lister v. Ferryman5
was displaced by the decision in the case of Abrath v. The North Eastern
Railway Company[6]. Having
repeatedly read this last mentioned case, and having also read
Mr. Stephens’s book, I am clearly of opinion that there is no warrant for
this proposition. The judge is entitled, no doubt, to the utmost assistance
from the jury in finding the facts, and he is entitled for this purpose to put
questions to them in any form which his ingenuity may suggest, but he, and not
the jury, is to make the deduction, and if he shifts the burden of doing so
upon them the case is not properly tried.

In the late case of Brown v. Hawkes[7] decided in

[Page 593]

June, 1891, and therefore, long since the
judgment of Armour C.J. in the present action which is now under appeal was
pronounced, Lord Esher M.R. thus states the law:

The question whether there is an absence of
reasonable and probable cause is for the judge and not for the jury, and if the
facts on which that depends are not in dispute there is nothing for him to ask
the jury, and he should decide the matter himself. If there are facts in dispute
upon which it is necessary he should be informed in order to arrive at a
conclusion on this point, these facts must be left specifically to the jury,
and when they have been determined in that way the judge must decide as to the
absence of reasonable and probable cause.

Now it appears to me that if the learned Chief
Justice had had this clear enunciation of the law as to the respective
functions of judge and jury in these cases of malicious prosecution before him
at the trial and had expressly adopted it for his guide, he could not have
followed the rule laid down by the Master of the Rolls more exactly than he
actually did.

There were no disputed facts. The only question
of fact could have been whether Alice Dale signed the written statement which
she gave to the appellant, a fact which was not disputed. It was not and could
not have been in dispute that Inspector Johnston’s report was not handed to the
appellant until after the charge was laid and the warrant issued.

There were then no facts in dispute to leave to
the jury, and the learned judge could not have left any question material to be
decided in the case to them without abdicating the functions which the law had
delegated to himself.

Then it only remains to inquire whether the
statement of the woman Dale warranted the appellant, as a police officer, in
adopting the course he pursued. This is the inference from the facts which it
was for the learned judge to draw, and his finding in respect to it

[Page 594]

is, I take it, open to review on appeal. As to
this I entirely agree with, the remarks of both the Chief Justice at the trial
and of Mr. Justice Burton in the Court of Appeal. If a police officer in
the position of the appellant is not warranted in acting without further
inquiry on such information as he receives from a woman who had been an inmate
of a suspected house, as Alice Dale had been, his efforts to perform his duty
in the suppression of such places would obviously be fruitless. There was ample
evidence of probable cause deducible from the undeniable facts of the case, and
the conclusion of the Chief Justice at the trial was, in my judgment,
altogether right.

I may add that it would not have made the
slightest difference in my conclusion if the second report of Inspector
Johnston had been communicated to the appellant before he swore to the
complaint before the police magistrate. The charge made by Alice Dale was not
that the respondents kept a disorderly house, but that they kept a house of
ill-fame, a house of assignation as she calls it, which was resorted to for
purposes of prostitution. The facts communicated by Inspector Johnston would
only apply to contradict a charge of a disorderly house which was not the
charge which led to the prosecution.

On the whole I do not see how the appellant, if
he had omitted to act as he did on the statement of Alice Dale, could have
justified himself before his superior officer if he had been charged with
neglect of duty.

Upon this question of probable cause the cases
of Lea v. Charrington[8]; Hope
v. Evered[9]; and Brougton
v. Jackson[10] seem
to me to be authorities for the appellant in the present case and to support
the conclusion I have arrived at. In the case last

[Page 595]

cited Lord Campbell C.J., says the defendant

must show facts which would create a reasonable
suspicion in the mind of a reasonable man.

Applying this test the evidence before us was
amply sufficient to show probable cause.

The appeal must be allowed, and the judgment of
the Chief Justice of the Queen’s Bench Division pronounced at the trial
restored with costs to the appellant in all the courts.

FOURNIES, J. concurred.

TASCHEREAU J.—I dissent. I would dismiss this
appeal. For the reasons given by Mr. Justice Rose in the Divisional Court,
I think that a new trial should be ordered. Upon the evidence, the judge
presiding at the trial should have left it to the jury to say if the defendant
believed the story of Alice Dale and if he took such precautions as a
reasonable man should have done to satisfy himself if her story was at least
plausible. The character of that woman, which he well knew, should have made
him more cautious.

GWYNNE J.—This appeal must, I think, be allowed
and upon the grounds stated by Justices Burton and Maclennan in the Court of
Appeal for Ontario. There was no contradiction in the evidence upon any matters
of fact upon which the non-existence of reasonable and probable cause
necessarily depended. It was for the learned judge who tried the case to
determine whether or not there was anything in the evidence or in the manner in
which it was given which created a doubt in his mind as to the defendant’s
belief in the truth of the statement made to him by the woman Dale, or which
cast a doubt in his mind as to the bona fides of the defendant in laying
the charges against the plaintiffs which he did before the police magistrate.
It was

[Page 596]

upon the learned judge, and, in the absence of
contradictory evidence upon essential facts on which the question of existence
or non-existence of probable cause depended, upon him alone, that the duty of
determining whether the defendant had or had not reasonable and probable cause
for making the charges which he did rested. If he saw in the evidence no
grounds to doubt the belief or bona fides of the defendant, and was of
opinion that the evidence failed to establish a want of reasonable and probable
cause or to cast a doubt upon its existence, I do not think that a new trial
should be granted because a judge who had not tried the case or heard and seen
the witnesses should see something in the evidence which he thinks would have
induced him to submit to the jury a question as to the belief of the defendant
in the facts stated to him and as to his bona fides in laying the
charge—or which he thinks would have made it proper for the learned trial
judge, though not absolutely necessary,—to have submitted to the jury such a
question. For my own part I must say that I do not see anything in the evidence
which I can say ought to have created such a doubt in the mind of the learned
trial judge that he should have submitted a question to the jury as to the
belief of the defendant in the facts stated to him and as to his bona fides in
laying the charge. In the absence of evidence which manifestly ought to have
created a doubt as to such belief and bona fides of the defendant, I do
not think that a judge who has not presided at the trial should interfere with
the judgment of the learned trial judge because he did not submit to the jury a
question upon a matter which, by the law, it was his duty to pronounce upon and
as to which the evidence had failed to create any doubt in his own mind.

The appeal must, I think, be allowed with costs
and the judgment of the learned trial judge sustained.

[Page 597]

PATTERSON J.—This is an action by the
respondents, husband and wife, against the appellant for malicious prosecution.

At the trial before Chief Justice Armour the
action was dismissed on the ground that the plaintiffs had failed to establish
the absence of reasonable and probable cause. A divisional court of the Common
Pleas Division set aside that judgment and ordered a new trial on the ground
that some question touching the good faith of the defendant ought to have been
submitted to the jury.

On the appeal to the Court of Appeal there was a
division of opinion, in consequence of which the decision of the divisional
court remained undisturbed.

The trial was the third trial of the action. The
three trials resulted in the same way, and in each case a new trial was
ordered. It appears to have been understood by the divisional court, or at all
events by the learned judge who delivered the judgment of the court, that at
the last trial the attention of the presiding judge had not been called to the
opinions expressed by the court in ordering the new trial. We are told by
counsel on both sides that this was a misapprehension, the fact being that the
judgment of the divisional court was communicated to the trial judge, which
fact would have been stated to the Court of Appeal if the matter had been
spoken of during the argument in that court where the learned Chief Justice, in
ignorance of the explanation, comments on the statement as contained in the
judgment delivered in the divisional court, justly characterizing it as almost
incredible.

At the trial of the action the only evidence
given was that adduced by the plaintiffs. The facts shown may, therefore, be
fairly treated, for all purposes of the present inquiry, as undisputed facts.

[Page 598]

The defendant is a police inspector of the city
of Toronto.

A woman called Alice Dale came to the defendant
on the eleventh of October, 1889, and gave him information which he wrote down,
Alice Dale signing the paper, which reads thus:

                                                                                       POLICE
DEPARTMENT,

                                                                                                TORONTO,
October 11, 1889.

Mrs. John Dale, at present rooming on
Victoria Street, between Queen and Shuter, west side, with a woman who takes in
washing, “Laundry” over door, vs. Mrs. McLaren, of 292 Adelaide Street
West, with whom she (Mrs. Dale) has been rooming for about five weeks,
from 2nd September to 8th October, keeping an house of assignation, allowing,
and in fact soliciting, the complainant to bring men into the house and pay her
fifty cents for use of room with each man. This she (Mrs. Dale) did on
several occasions, giving Mrs. McLaren fifty cents each time; in addition
to this, Mrs: McLaren made arrangements with Mrs. Dale to go with another
man, from whom she received twenty dollars on four different occasions, and
gave Mrs. McLaren five dollars on three different occasions; and on
Mrs. Dale refusing to give the five dollars on the fourth occasion, she
was ordered by Mrs. McLaren to pack up and leave the house; and she now
refuses to give up Mrs. Dale’s two trunks.

I have had the foregoing read over to me by
Staff Inspector Archibald, and I subscribe to it as being correct.

                                                                           (Signed)        ALICE
DALE.

The eleventh of October was Friday.

On Monday, the fourteenth of October, the
defendant laid an information against the two plaintiffs, Margaret McLaren and
her husband, for keeping a house of ill-fame.

The plaintiffs were arrested at an early hour on
the morning of Tuesday, the 15th. They were brought before the police
magistrate on the forenoon of the same day and were discharged.

The question of reasonable and probable cause,
or of the absence of it which is what the plaintiffs had to establish, does not
depend on Mrs. Dale’s statement alone. There are other things to be
presently men-

[Page 599]

tioned, but we may first note something of what
the plaintiff, Mrs. McLaren, tells in her evidence, though it may only
indirectly affect the defendant who was a stranger to her and her history. Her
story is that she had entertained Mrs. Dale as a lodger whom she
considered respectable for a couple of weeks, and then Mrs. Dale and her
husband for some three weeks more; until the evening of Tuesday, the eighth of
October, when she discovered, by reading a letter that Mrs. Dale gave to
Mr. McLaren to mail but had left open, that Mrs. Dale was a person of
bad character, when she promptly made her leave the house, but kept her trunks
on account of five dollars due for the two weeks before the husband came. On
Wednesday, the 9th, Mrs. Dale had tried ineffectually to get her trunks,
and on Thursday, the 10th, she got a lawyer to write a letter which she took to
Mrs. McLaren who produced it at the trial. The defendant had, of course,
nothing to do with all this, nor is it his concern which is the true version of
the relations between the two women that told him by Mrs. Dale or that
given by Mrs. McLaren. But it is evident from the lawyer’s letter that his
client told him the same story on Thursday that she told on Friday to the
defendant, and that the defendant did not misinterpret her statement when he
laid the information.

This is what the lawyer wrote:

                                                                                       TORONTO,
October 10th, 1889.

DEAR MADAM.—I have had a conference with
Miss Dale who has explained to me the difficulty between you, and the relations
between you.

You have no right to hold her trunks and
clothing. If you do not give them up at once proceedings will be taken. If any
exposure occurs the fault will be your own.

Now, what occurred between Friday, when
Mrs. Dale made her statement, and Monday when the information was laid?

[Page 600]

The defendant took no immediate action on the
statement, but he asked Inspector Johnston, who was the police inspector for
division no. 3 which included the plaintiff’s house, to procure information as
to the character of the house. Johnston learned from other policemen that
disturbances occurred in the house which had to be quelled by the police, and
he told this to the defendant on the Monday before the information was laid.
Johnston’s information seems to have been that the disturbances were fights
between the husband and wife occasioned by the wife’s intemperance. He
intimated that to the defendant on the Tuesday morning after the arrest of the
plaintiffs, expressing at the same time his own opinion that there was not much
in the charge of keeping a house of ill-fame.

It has been regarded as an open question in the
courts below whether the information as to the nature of the disturbances was
given by Johnston to the defendant before the laying of the information on
Monday, or not until Tuesday, and the question has been regarded as almost a
crucial test of the good faith of the defendant. I do not attach so much
importance to the time when the communication was made, but at the same time I
am unable to see that upon any fair reading of the evidence, which, as I have
said is all adduced by the plaintiffs, and which, on this topic, is the
evidence of Johnston and of the defendant, it can be doubted that the only
information conveyed to the defendant on the Monday was the general fact that
rows had occurred in the house, or that the character of the rows was only
mentioned on Tuesday just before and in reference to the trial of the charge
which Johnston thought had not much in it.

Another fact brought out was that, after the
defendant had taken Mrs. Dale’s statement and before he

[Page 601]

had heard from Johnston, his attention was
called by the Mayor and by an alderman to the necessity for farther police
protection in division no. 3, several streets being particularized, but none in
the immediate vicinity of the plaintiffs’ house. The use made of this incident
in argument is in support of the charge of malice rather than that of want of
reasonable and probable cause, the suggestion being that the defendant was
stimulated into action by imputations on his efficiency as the inspector more
particularly assigned to the duty of suppressing houses of ill-fame, and did not
act from an honest belief in the truth of Mrs. Dale’s information.

This is, however, only argument and suggestion.
The evidence which connects in any way the two incidents is, as far as it goes,
affirmative evidence of the defendant’s belief in Mrs. Dale’s story, and
it certainly implies no doubt of the truth of what she had stated.

I shall read the passage:

47. Q.—Tell me, Inspector, had the
information that you received from the Mayor and Alderman Verrai anything to do
with your laying this information against the McLarens? A.—It certainly had,
for in making the report to the Chief that this complaint had been made by the
Mayor and Alderman, and the request for special police protection in No. 3
Division, I stated that I had positive information about a house in this
neighborhood.

48. Q.—Stated to whom? A.—To the Chief.

49. Q.—What house had you in your mind?
A.—I had the McLaren’s house in my mind, and he said: “Then if you have
evidence, why not bring it up?”

50. Q.—When you had McLaren’s house in your
mind, it was from the information that you had received from Inspector Johnston
and Alice Dale—that put it in your mind? A. It was the information I had
received from Alice Dale.

51. Q.—And Inspector Johnston? A.—I had not
yet received the information from Inspector Johnston.

52. Q.—Then, the Chief told you if you had
any positive evidence why not bring them up? A.—Yes; to which I replied: “I
will make

[Page 602]

further inquiries of the inspector of the
division, and if that information is corroborated, I will do so.”

53. Q.—You did make further inquiries from
the inspector of the division, who is Inspector Johnston? A.—Yes.

54. Q.—You got his report, and with that
report and the evidence from Alice Dale you took these proceedings? A.—Yes.

A number of decisions on the subject of the
respective functions of the court and the jury in dealing with the question of
reasonable and probable cause have been cited and commented on at the bar, as
well as by learned judges in the courts below. I do not think it necessary to
discuss those cases, because the law as settled by them is to be found fully
and correctly stated in several treatises of recognized learning and accuracy.

I shall quote from two of those treatises, viz.,
Taylor on Evidence[11] and
Pollock on Torts.

Judge Taylor, after discussing the general
nature of the class of cases termed “mixed cases,” gives the following summary
of the decisions that had been reported on the subject down to the year 1884:—

§28. First: It is now clearly established,
albeit the wisdom of the rule has been stoutly disputed, that the question of probable
cause must be decided exclusively by the judge, and that the jury can only
be permitted to find whether the facts alleged in support of the presence or
absence of probability, and the inference to be drawn therefrom, really exist.
For instance, in an action for malicious prosecution the jury, provided the
evidence on the subject be conflicting, may be asked whether or not the
defendant, at the time when he prosecuted, knew of the existence of
those circumstances which tend to show probable cause, or believed that
they amounted to the offence which he charged; and if they negative either of
these facts the judge will decide, as a point of law, that the defendant had no
probable cause for instituting the prosecution. This rule, which is based on
the assumption that judges are far more competent than juries to determine the
question how far it may have been proper for a person to have instituted a
prosecution, is equally binding however numerous and complicated the facts and
inferences may be; for although in some cases

[Page 603]

it would doubtless be attended with great
difficulty to bring before the jury all the combinations of which numerous
facts are susceptible, and to place in a distinct point of view the application
of the rule of law, according as all or some only of the facts and inferences
from facts are made out to their satisfaction, yet the task is not
impracticable; and if would obviously savour of gross inconsistency to hold that
a rule which is undisputed in a simple case should not equally apply when the
facts were complicated. For where could the line be drawn, and who should
determine what degree of complexity would transfer the burden of decision from
the judge to the jury. The difficulty, too, is more apparent than real, for it
rarely happens but that some leading facts exist in each case, which present a
broad distinction to the view without having recourse to the less important
circumstances; and as the judge has a right to act upon all the uncontradicted
facts, it is only when some doubt is thrown upon the credibility of the
witnesses, or where some contradiction occurs, or some inference is attempted
to be drawn from some former fact not distinctly sworn to, that he is called
upon to submit any question to the jury.

I read from Mr. Pollock’s work, which was
published, I think, in 1887, the concluding passage of the section that treats
of false imprisonment[12].

What is reasonable cause of suspicion to
justify arrest is, paradoxical as the statement may look, neither a question of
law nor of fact. Not of fact, because it is for the judge and not for the jury;
not of law, because “no definite rule can be laid down for the exercise of the
judge’s judgment.” It is a matter of judicial discretion such as is familiar
enough in the classes of cases which are disposed of by a judge sitting alone;
but this sort of discretion does not find a natural place in a system which
assigns the decision of facts to the jury and the determination of the law to
the judge. The anomalous character of the rule has been more than once pointed
out and regretted by the highest judicial authority, but it is too well settled
to be disturbed unless by legislation. The only thing which can be certainly affirmed
in general terms about the meaning of “reasonable cause” in this connection is
that on the one hand a belief honestly entertained is not of itself enough; on
the other hand a man is not bound to wait until he is in possession of such
evidence as would be admissible and sufficient for prosecuting the offence to
conviction, or even of the best evidence which he might obtain by further
inquiry. It does not follow that because it would be very reasonable to make
further inquiry, it is not reasonable to act without doing so. It is obvious
also that the exist-

[Page 604]

ence or non-existence of reasonable cause
must be judged, not by the event, but by the party’s means of knowledge at the
time.

The numerous cases cited by Judge Taylor as
authority for the propositions he lays down include all those cited to us down
to the date of Abrath v. N.E. Railway Co. in which the decision of the
Court of Appeal[13]
pronounced in 1883, was affirmed in 1886 by the House of Lords[14].

That case is not cited by Mr. Pollock in
connection with the passage I have read from his treatise, but he cites it when
dealing with actions for malicious prosecution[15]
and gives the following extract from the judgment of Lord Justice Bowen[16]:—

In an action for malicious prosecution the
plaintiff has to prove, first, that he was innocent and that his innocence was
pronounced by the tribunal before which the accusation was made; secondly, that
there was a want of reasonable and probable cause for the prosecution, or, as
it may be otherwise stated, that the circumstances of the case were such as to
be, in the eyes of the judge, inconsistent with the existence of reasonable and
probable cause; and lastly, that the proceedings of which he complains were
initiated in a malicious spirit, that is from an indirect and improper motive,
and not in furtherance of justice.

In the present case there is no conflicting
evidence. The facts on which the defendant acted are uncontradicted facts. The
main fact is that Mrs. Dale made the statement, but this must, of course,
be taken along with the fact that it was made to the defendant in his official
character as police inspector and as the officer whose special duty it was to
look after houses such as Alice Dale described. She had been referred to the
defendant by the lawyer already mentioned, and the defendant’s special line of
duty appears from his examination.

[Page 605]

If these were all the facts, that is to say, if
the defendant had laid the information immediately after taking Alice Dale’s
statement, I could not say that a judge who held that there was reasonable and
probable cause for making the charge was wrong in so holding. The facts stated
by Alice Dale respecting her tenancy of the room she had in the plaintiff’s
house, are of the same character as those on which in Reg. v. Rice[17] a conviction for keeping a
disorderly house was sustained by the Court of Criminal Appeal although there
was no evidence of indecency or disorderly conduct perceptible from outside the
house.

The great contention is that the jury should
have been asked to say if the defendant believed what Alice Dale told him. But
there is not a word in the evidence on which to found a suggestion of bad
faith, and it is, in my judgment, impossible to say that the Chief Justice gave
too much effect to the fact that the defendant acted throughout in his official
character.

The other facts, the inquiry made through
Inspector Johnson and the report of disturbances at the house, certainly do not
aid the plaintiffs in their attempt to negative the existence of reasonable and
probable cause for laying the information, nor do I see that even if Johnston’s
full intelligence had been given at once, and the defendant had, therefore,
laid the information understanding that the female plaintiff was addicted to
excessive drinking which led to quarrels with her husband by which the peace of
the neighbourhood was disturbed, the gravamen of Alice Dale’s imputations
against the female plaintiff, and by consequence against the husband who would
naturally be credited with complicity in the purposes for which it was alleged
his house was used, was at all done away with.

[Page 606]

I agree with the learned judges of appeal who
considered that the non-suit ought not to have been set aside and I am of
opinion that we should allow the appeal[18].

PRESENT.—Sir W. J. Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier,
Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).

Error—Writ of—On what founded—Right of crown to stand aside
jurors when panel of jurors has been gone through—Question of law not reserv ed at trial—Criminal Procedure Act—R. S. G. ch. 174, secs, 164, 256 and 266.

When a panel had been gone through and a full jury had not
been obtained the crown on the second calling over the panel was per mitted,
against the objection of the prisoner, to direct eleven of the jurymen on the
panel to stand aside a second time, and the judge presiding at the trial was
not asked to reserve and neither reserved nor refused to reserve the objection.
After conviction and judgment a writ of error was issued.

Held, Pet Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ., affirming
the judgment of the court below, that the question was one of law arising on
the trial which could have been reserved under sec. 259 of ch. 174 R. S. C. and the writ of error should, therefore, be quashed. Sec.
266 ch. 174 R. S. C.

Per Ritchie C J and Strong and Fournier JJ. That the question arose before the trial
commenced and could not have been reserved and as the error of law appeared on
the face of the record the remedy by writ of error was applicable. (Brisebois
v. The Queen, 15 Can. S. C. R. 421 referred to)

Per Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier and Patterson JJ., that
the crown could not without showing cause for challenge direct a juror to stand
aside a second time. Sec. 164 oh. 174 R. S. C. (The
Queen v. Lacombe, 13 L. C. Jur. 259 overruled).

Per Owynne J.—That all the prisoner could complain of was a
mere irregularity in procedure which could not constitute a mis-trial.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for
Lower Canada quashing a writ of error in a case of murder.

[Page 408]

The assignment of errors upon which the writ of error was
issued is given at length in the judgment of the chief justice hereinafter
given.

F. LANGELIER Q.C. appeared on behalf of the prisoner.

J. DUNBAR Q.C. appeared for the crown.

The sections of the Criminal Procedure Act R. S. C. ch. 174,
and the cases cited and relied on by counsel are all reviewed at length in the
judgments hereinafter given.

SIR W. J. RITCHIE C.J.—This is an appeal from a
judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for the Province of Quebec (appeal side)
dated the 8th of October, 1890, quashing a writ of error to try the validity of
a verdict for murder given against the plaintiff in error, Jean
Baptiste Hermenegilde Morin, at the session of the Court of Queen's
Bench (crown side) held at Mont magny, in the district of Montmagny, on the
26th day of March, 1890, and subsequent days.

The ground upon which the appeal to this court is based is
thus stated in the assignment of errors, being in effect the same statement of
it as that contained in the record as returned to the writ of error:

“That at the time of the last criminal assizes at the district
of Montmagny commenced on the 26th of March last the said Jean Baptiste
Hermenegilde Morin was accused of the murder of one Fabien Roy
in virtue of an indictment presented by the grand jury of the said
district;""

"" That the said Morin pleaded not guilty to the said
indictment, and, after trial had before a jury, was found guilty of the said
charge of murder and was condemned by virtue of the sentence of the said court
passed on the first of April last to be hanged on the 16th May instant ""

[Page 409]

"" That the said verdict,
the said sentence, the proceedings at the said trial, the proof made in
connection therewith, the swearing and the choosing of jurors, the orders
judgments and action of the said court of Queen's Bench for Montmagny are illegal, null and of no effect, and tainted with
legal error, the whole as is hereinafter shown :""

“Because at the time of the
swearing of the jurors and the calling of their names according to the panel
the crown, by its representative, caused to stand aside the greater part of the
jurors called, and thus caused to stand aside, among others, Louis Sénéchal,
Joseph Pouliot, François Vézina, Augustin Vézina, François Pouliot,
Louis Collier, Salomon Brochu, Joseph La brecque, Evariste Leclerc, Joseph
Caron, Adolphe Leclerc and Edmond Duquet, all
jurors duly qualified :""

“Because all the said panel of jurors had been gone through and called even
to and inclusive of the last name thereon:""

"" Because the clerk of the
crown recommenced to call the names of the jurors on the said panel who had not
been sworn, and called anew the person
named Louis Sénéchal who had been caused to stand aside by the crown at the
time of the first calling of his name :""

"" Because the crown, by
its representative, wished airain
to cause to stand aside the said Louis Sénéchal but
the said accused by his advocate objected thereto and contended that the crown
could not cause to stand aside and challenge the said Sénéchal except
for cause:"" Because, contrary to law the court dismissed the objection of
the said accused and permitted the crown to cause the said Sénéchal to
stand aside without giving and showing cause :""

""
That the said causing to stand aside of the said Sénéchal, and
the said decision are illegal and tainted with error :""

[Page 410]

"" That the said causing to stand aside of the said Sénéchal, objections and decisions were put in writing and made
part of the record in said cause :""

''That the same proceedings, objections, decisions and
recording thereof were made as to the jurors fol lowing .Joseph Pouliot, François Vézina, Augustin Vézina, François Pouliot, Louis Collier, Salomon
Bro chu, Joseph Labrecque, Evariste Leclerc, Joseph Caron,
Adolphe Leclerc and Edmond Duquet.""

The assignment of errors was endorsed as follows: 

"" Original assignment of errors filed this 1st October,
1890. Assignment of errors had and replied to instanter and hearing ordered
Saturday next.""

"" Writ quashed. Tessier J. dissentiente.""

The questions which arise in this case turn on the true
construction of sections 259, 164 and 266, R.S.C. c. 174 which
enact 

Sec.259. Every court before which any person is convicted on
indictment of any treason, felony or misdemeanor, and every judge within the
meaning of "" The Speedy Trials Act,"" trying any person under such Act
may, in its or his discretion, reserve any question of law
which arises on the trial, for the consideration of the justices of the court
for Crown cases reserved, and thereupon may respite execution of the judgment
on such conviction, or postpone the judgment until such question has been
considered and decided.

Sec.164. In all criminal trials four jurors may be
peremptorily challenged on the part of the Crown but this shall not be
construed to affect the right of the Crown to cause any juror to stand aside
until the panel has been gone through, or to challenge any number of jurors for
cause.

Sec 266 No writ of error shall be allowed in any criminal case
unless it is founded on some question of law which could not have been
reserved, or which the judge presiding at the trial refused to reserve for the
consideration of the court having jurisdiction in such cases.

It is very obvious that while by section 259 of the Procedure
Act c. 174, a judge may reserve any question of law which arises on the trial
there may be, under section 266, questions of law which could

[Page 411]

not be reserved, that is, questions not arising on the trial
for which a ""writ of error may lie. The first question to be determined
then is Was this a question arising on the trial l To determine this we must
ascertain when the trial begins. To do this it will be necessary to examine the
mode of procedure in criminal cases.

Mr. Archbold in his work on pleading and evidence in criminal
cases says as to the arraignment ([1])
:—

Arraignment.—The arraignment of prisoners, against whom
true bills for indictable offences have
been found by the grand jury consists of three parts : First, calling
the prisoner to the bar by name; secondly, reading the indictment to him;
thirdly, asking him whether he be guilty or not of the offence charged. It was
formerly the practice to require the prisoner to hold up his hand, the more
completely to identify him as the person named in the indictment, but the
ceremony, which was never essentially necessary, is now disused; and the
ancient form of asking him how he will be tried is
also obsolete

* * * *

Challenge of Jurors ([2]).—When
a sufficient number of prisoners have pleaded and put themselves upon the
country, the clerk of the arraigns addresses the prisoners thus:
""Prisoners, these good men that you shall now hear called are the jurors
who are to pass between our sovereign lady the Queen and you upon your respective
trials; (01 in a capital case, upon your life and death); if, therefore,
you or any of you will challenge them or any of them you must challenge them as
they come to the book to be sworn and before they are sworn, and you shall be
heard. The officer then proceeds to call twelve jurors from the panel, calling
each juror by name and address. Hereupon, and after a full jury has appeared
(R. v. Edmonds, 4 B. & Al. 471) the proper time occurs for the
defendant to exercise his right of challenge, or exception to the jurors
returned to pass upon his trial.

* * * *

The usual, and in general the proper course where the panel is
exhausted by the challenges of the prisoner and the crown or of either before a
full jury remains is to call over the whole panel again in the same order as
before, but omitting those peremptorily challenged by the prisoner; and then,
as each juror again appears whichever party

[Page 412]

challenges must show cause. If no sufficient cause of
challenge be shown the jurors are then sworn. R. v. Geach C. & P. 499.

Then comes the giving the prisoner in charge to the jury, as
to which Mr. Archbold says at the next page :

Giving the prisoner in
charge of the jury.—In cases of
treason and felony the crier (at the assises) makes proclamation in the
following form : "" If any one can inform my Lords the Queen's Justices,
the Queen's Attorney General, or the Queen's Sergeant ere this inquest
taken"" [this is in my opinion before it is taken] between our Sovereign
Lady the Queen and the prisoners at the bar of any treason, murder, felony or
misdemeanor committed or done by them or any of them, let him come forth and he
shall ho heard; for the prisoners stand at the bar upon their deliverance. Cro.
Cir. Com. 6 (10th ed.); 2 B. & Ad. 256.

When this proclamation has been read Mr. Chitty in his work on
Criminal Law ([3]).
says :

The trial commences in the manner we shall presently consider.

And in the next chapter 14, he treats of the trial evidence
and verdict and says :.

The jury having been thus assembled in the jury box and sworn
the clerk bids the prisoner hold up his hand for purposes of identification
this is not now used) and addressing the ""jury says : ""Look
upon the prisoner, you that are sworn and hearken to his cause.""

He then describes the proceedings on jury trials much as Mr
Archbold does which commences by giving the prisoner in charge to the jury thus
:

The clerk of arraigns then calls the prisoners to the bar and
says :— Gentlemen of the jury, the prisoner stands indicted by the name of A.
B. for that he on the &c., (as in the indictment to the end). Upon this
indictment he has been arraigned and upon his arraignment he has pleaded that
he is not guilty.

Mr. Chitty adds :

"" And for his trial bath put himself upon God and the
country which country you are. Your charge, therefore, is to inq   uire whether
he be guilty or not guilty and to hearken to the evidence.

Mr. Chitty adds :

[Page 413]

When the prisoner is given in charge to the jury the counsel
for the prosecution or if there be more than one the senior counsel opens the
case to the jury stating the legal facts upon which the prosecution relied.

Then, and not till then, does the trial, in my opinion,
commence.

Lord Campbell in Mansell v. The Queen ([4]) says;

After prisoners have had their challenges, the oath of the
juryman is : "" You shall well and truly try and a true deliverance make,
between our sovereign lady the Queen, and the several prisoners you shall have
in charge."" When the prisoner is given in charge to the jury, by that jury
he must be tried, and in felony or treason the jury cannot separate till they
have found their verdict.' But (as often happens at the assizes) before a
particular prisoner who has had his challenges is given in charge to the jury,
the court rises and the jury separate. Next morning a new jury is called when
the prisoner again has his challenges; and possibly there may not be one
individual upon the second jury that was sworn on the first ■ yet all
this is regular.

In Regina v Faderman
([5]) the
counsel for the prisoner says '.—

By statute 11 & 12 Vic. c. 78 sec. 1 any question of law
may be reserved for this court which shall have arisen on the trial The trial
commences as soon as the prisoner is called on to plead.

Parke B. says :—

Properly there is no trial until the issue is joined. This I
take to mean until the prisoner is given in charge to the jury.

Alderson B. says :—

You say the trial begins with the arraignment; how then do you
explain the question which is put to the prisoner after arraignment : How will
you be tried ? At what point in the proceedings did the trial by battle begin?
Trial is a very technical word.

This being so I think we are, in a case such as this, not to
enlarge its signification and treat it in a popular or general sense, but to
give the term a strict construction

It is clear that if the question did arise on the trial, we
have no jurisdiction to hear it. In the following

[Page 414]

case where a party pleaded guilty it was held it could not be
heard on a case reserved. The Queen v. Clark ([6]).

This case was considered by Cockburn C. J., Martin and
Bramwell BB., and Mellor and Montague Smith JJ. No counsel appeared on either
side.

Cockburn C. J. :

In this case we have no jurisdiction. It was not a question
arising on the trial; for the man pleaded guilty, and he must be taken to know
the law. The power to state a case for the consideration
of this court only applies to questions of law which arise on the trial.

I have been referred to the case of Regina v. Brown ([7]), where the
prisoner was convicted upon his own confession. It is not stated in the case
that the prisoner pleaded guilty, nor whether he had been given in charge to
the jury and had on his trial confessed to offence. The court held that the
point did arise on the trial It is difficult to see how if the prisoner pleaded
guilty when arraigned, the case could be distinguished from Regina v. Clark
(1) but the court thus distinguished it .*

""'We
think therefore that this court has jurisdiction to
entertain the case and we think it notwithstanding Regina v. Clark (1).
It is to be observed that that case is not directly in point, because there the
indictment was good, though the facts stated in the depositions did not support
it. The prisoner having pleaded guilty to the indictment the court thought that
the point did not arise at the trial. The distinction in the present case is
that the objection was not as to the sufficiency of proof, but arose upon the
indictment itself. It was an objection which might have been taken without the
proof being gone into We should not have shrunk from differing from the
decision in Regina v. Clark (1) if that case
had been directly in point. It is not and therefore we do not actually differ
from it.

We are of opinion 1st—That we have jurisdiction to entertain
this case, and 2ndly—that upon the facts and clearly upon the general law, the boy was properly convicted upon his own confession of
an attempt to commit an unnatural offence.

It is to be remarked that this case was decided with- 

[Page 415]

out the court having the assistance of counsel, and that the
case of Regina v. Faderman ([8])
was not cited or referred to in which Lord Campbell thus speaks :

We all think that this court has no jurisdiction to entertain
tins question. We are asked to review a judgment for the crown given on
demurrer and to reverse it if we think it wrong. The only power we have is
derived from the statute 11—12 Vic. ch. 78. That act gives us no such power the
word "" convicted "" there used means convicted by a verdict.
Trial means trial before a jury. ""We have no power in case of a judgment
on demurrer. It would be dangerous if We had for as it is clear that no writ of
error lies from our judgment we should by hearing this case be depriving the
prisoner of a right which he would otherwise be entitled to.

Until a full jury is sworn there can be no trial, because
until that is done there is no tribunal competent to try the prisoner. The
terms of the jurymen's oath seem to show this. And as is to be inferred as we
have even from what Lord Campbell says that all that takes place anterior to
the completion and swearing of the jury is preliminary to the trial.

How can the prisoner be tried until there is a court competent
to try him? And how can there be a court until there is a judge on the bench
and a jury in the box duly sworn? Until there is a court thus constituted there
can be no trial because there is no tribunal competent to try him. But when
there is a court duly constituted the prisoner being present and given in
charge to the jury his trial in my opinion commences, and not before. The trial
mentioned in the statute is clearly a trial of the prisoner by the jury, as we
have seen it held in Regina v. Faderman (1). No prisoner can be tried except by
a jury duly selected and sworn to try him but there may be questions
preliminary to the obtaining a competent jury to which the right to reserve a
case cannot, in my opinion, apply. Thus if after a full jury appears and the
array is challenged

[Page 416]

this is tried by the court. In Bacon's Abridgement ([9]) it is said :—


Every question of law raised upon a challenge to the array of
the jury is to be tried by the court upon an examination of witnesses;
for J unless every such question, although it depend upon a matter of fact, be
so tried, there would be a delay of justice.

It is said that in Regina v. Manning
([10]),
where the prisoner's wife applied for a jury de méditâtes
lingue which was rejected on the ground that she was naturalized,
the array was challenged, but in that case the array does not appear to have
been challenged for the court held the trial must proceed. Mr. Ballantine moved
that his application might be entered on the record, the attorney general said
that if that were done he would plead that the female prisoner had married said
Edward Manning a natural born subject of the realm. After some consultation it
was agreed that Mr. Ballantyne should have the option of raising the question
on the record or of having the point reserved for the consideration of the
Court of Appeal in criminal cases.

So in a case of a challenge to the polls, Mr. Archbold in his
pleading and evidence m criminal cases saps ([11]) '.

In the case of a principal challenge to thepolis,if the
partiality be made apparent to the satisfaction of the court, the challenge is
at once allowed, and the juror set aside. But in the case of a challenge to the
favor it is left to the discretion of two triers who are sworn and charged to
try whether the juror challenged stands indifferent between the parties. The
form of oath to a trier, to try whether a juror stands indifferent or not is as
follows '.

“You shall well and truly try whether A.B., one of the jurors,
stands indifferently to try the prisoner at the bar, and a true verdict give
according to the evidence. So help you God.""

It may be observed, that no challenge of triers is admissible.
The form of oath to be administered to a witness sworn to give evidence
before the triers is as follows :

""The evidence which you shall give to the
court and triers upon this

[Page 417]

inquest shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but
the truth So help you God.""

If the challenge is to the first juror called, the court may
select any two indifferent persons as triers; if they find against the
challenge, the juror will be sworn, and be joined with the triers in
determining the next challenge; but as soon as two jurors have been found
indifferent, and have been sworn, every subsequent challenge will be referred
to their decision 2 Hale 275; Co Litt 158 a; Bac. Abr., Juries
(E) 12. The trial thus directed proceeds by witnesses called to support or
defeat the challenge.

After the decision I have quoted nobody would, I should think,
pretend to say that either of these trials was the trial contemplated by the
statute as to which any case could be reserved, showing very clearly, I think,
that the trial contemplated was, as I have said a trial by a jury after it was
completed, and if no case can be reserved upon such trials of challenges does
it not follow that a case cannot be reserved when the judge rules that the
crown was not obliged to challenge for cause, assuming the law requires the
crown to do so ? Why should a case be reserved to compel the crown to make a
good challenge by assigning cause when if the crown has assigned cause and its
sufficiency was referred to tiers a question arising on such a trial could not
be reserved?

In The Queen v. Lamb ([12]) after the
prisoner had been given in charge and before any witness was sworn it appeared
that the prosecutrix, a child of four years of age did not sufficiently
understand the nature of an oath, and it was admitted on the part of the crown
that there was no other evidence to sustain the case On the part of the
prisoner it was insisted that having been given in charge to the jury he was
entitled to his acquittal. The judge discharged the jury obliging the prisoner
to enter into a recognizance with sufficient sureties for his appearance at the
next court. A

[Page 418]

case was submitted to the twelve judges to ascertain whether
in their opinion, the prisoner was entitled ° to his acquittal or whether the
court was justified, under the circumstances, in discharging the jury, and
authorized to bind over the prisoner to appear and take his trial at the next
court. The judges unanimously gave their opinion that the prisoner ought to
have been acquitted and that he should be recommended for a pardon.

And the case of REGINA
V. WADE ([13]) is to the
same effect.

Why was this ? Because, having been given in charge to the
jury, no legal cause having been alleged or question shown for discharging the
jury, the prisoner then being on his trial he must be either convicted or
acquitted. As no evidence was offered he was on that trial therefore entitled
to his acquittal, as he would have been if the evidence offered had been
insufficient; but it is very different when a full jury to try the prisoner
cannot be obtained, though some jurors have been sworn, but not sufficient to
make a full jury and the jury has to be discharged for default of jurors * but
where all were sworn and a good cause shown for discharging them, as the
illness of a juryman, etc., a new jury may be impanelled, and the prisoner will
be entitled to challenge as in the first instance showing very clearly the
difference where the prisoner has been given in charge and no cause shown for
the discharge of the jury. In the first case the prisoner was in jeopardy, in
the second he never was and in the third case he ceased to be when the jury
were legally discharged. But is it not equally clear that if the alleged trial
was not a legal trial but a mistrial, and therefore a nullity, if reversed he
can again be tried because he never was in jeopardy ? It

[Page 419]

is a fundamental principle of law that a man shall not he
twice in jeopardy for the same offence, that is, no prisoners shall be
prosecuted twice for the same offence., I think the fair test of when the trial
begins is : When was the prisoner put in jeopardy ? It is to my mind very clear
that no jeopardy can attach until a full jury is impannelled, sworn on a plea
of not guilty and the prisoner given in charge to such jury because there can
be no trial until there is a jury competent to try. Mr. Bishop, in his work on
Criminal Law states the law as recognised in the United States very clearly,
and which in my opinion is equally applicable to this Dominion. He says ([14]):—

When jeopardy begins. Then on the completing and
swearing of the panel the jeopardy of the accused begins and it begins only
when the panel is full. Until full the jeopardy is not perfect. In order words,
. without a jury set apart and sworn for the particular case the individual
defendant has not been conducted to his period of jeopardy. But when, according
to the better opinion, the jury being full is sworn, and added to the other
branch of the court and all the preliminary things of
record are ready for the trial the prisoner has reached the jeopardy from the
repetition of which our constitutional rule protects him.citing in support of
this very many American authorities.

If, then, this question arose while the preliminary
proceedings were in progress and before the trial commenced it could not
therefore be reserved. Then the next question that arises is : Was it a proper
case for a wr  it of error ? I think it most clearly was. The sections of ch.
174 applicable to this I have read. Assuming that this is not a legal trial and
no question could be reserved for the reasons stated and the prisoner is
deprived of his writ of error, how can he possibly avail himself of his right
to show the validity of his objection ? I am aware that doubts have been
expressed by

[Page 420]

learned judges in England as to a writ of error being proper
in such a case as this, but I understand their doubts have been suggested because in England the question of the
right of a party to insist that there should be only a challenge for cause
after the panel has been gone through has been considered rather a matter of
practice than of law but in this Dominion it is matter of law and in this case
appears on the face of the record; it is a right secured to the prisoner under
the statute I have referred to. The practice in England has been by statute
recognised to be the law of this Dominion and as to any error of law appearing
on the face of the record the remedy by writ of error if applicable. In Short
and Mellor's Practice of the Crown Office ([15]) as to error
it is said :—

It is a characteristic feature in English criminal procedure
that it admits of no appeal properly so called either upon matters of fact or
upon matters of law. though there are a certain number of proceedings which to
some extent appear to be, and to some extent are, exceptions to this rule

The first of these exceptions is a writ of error. It is a
remedy applicable to those cases only in which some irregularity apparent upon
the record of the proceedings takes place in the procedure.

In Regina v. Frost ([16]), Sir
J.Campbell A. G. says :

It may le allowed that, in considering this and all other
statutes, the intention of the legislature was to be looked for; when that was
discovered, courts were bound by it. Whatever form the legislature had clearly
prescribed, must be observed; and it may be allowed that it is not for the
judges, if that form has been clearly and distinctly prescribed to consider
whether it was or not advantageous to the prisoner. The doctrine of equivalents
and equipollents must be discharged. Whatever the prisoner was entitled to by
acts of parliament, that specific thing he had a right to demand; and it would
be vain to say that something, even more for his advantage, had been conferred.
But in ascertaining the meaning of the legislature, it might be most material
to see what was the object and how that obiect could best be accomplished.

I think we should be most careful not to deprive a

[Page 421]

prisoner of his writ of error unless we are satisfied. beyond
all reasonable doubt that the statute has taken it away from him.

This brings us to the last and really the substantial matter
of this case. The practice which I have said our Parliament by statute has
recognised to be acted upon is that after giving the crown in all criminal
trials four peremptory challenges it declares that this shall not be construed
to affect the right of the crown to cause any juror to stand aside until the
panel has been gone through or to challenge any number of jurors for cause. If
we look at the practice in England, as to the effect of desiring jurors to
stand aside, or that in the provinces previous to the passing of this statute,
so far as my experience extends and as I can discover, the practice has been
entirely consistent, namely, that the panel shall be gone through, or perused
as it is termed, once on which calling or perusal it was the privilege of the
crown to require jurors to stand aside until the list shall be gone through.
Having been gone through and a jury not secured the clerk proceeds to go over
the panel a second time when the right of the crown to require jurors to stand
aside ceased, and the crown was bound, if its officers sought to perfect its
challenge, to do so by showing some good and sufficient cause or to challenge
peremptorily if the peremptory challenges were not exhausted. This practice, in
my opinion, as I have said, is recognised and consecrated by the statute I have
referred to. I cannot discover on the part of Parliament any intention to alter
the law and practice and establish a different mode of procedure. It is
abundantly clear that in this case the panel had been gone through and was
exhausted and a full jury could not be obtained without those who had been
asked to stand aside by the crown being

[Page 422]

again called. Then the period had arrived at which the crown was
bound to assign cause and instead of being compelled to do so the crown was on
the second perusal of the panel again allowed to
cause jurors to "" stand aside without showing cause. In Regina v. cropper ([17]), the course
of proceeding is very clearly pointed out, as follows :

The jury panel contained the names of forty-eight persons. On
its being called over, seven were challenged by the prisoner and five by the
crown. Only eight others of the forty-eight juryman were in attendance, besides
those challenged, and those eight went into the box.

The panel had been entirely called through. The counsel for
the prisoner then proposed that the panel should be again called, which was
done, and on the first challenge on the part of the crown, the counsel for the
prisoner called upon the counsel for the crown to assign cause of challenge. Cause was assigned, which appeared to the learned
baron to be insufficient, and that juryman was sworn. The next juryman
challenged on the part of the crown was sworn on the voir dire, and examined
for cause, which cause was not allowed by the learned baron; he was then sworn.
The challenges of the next two jurymen were given up by the counsel for the
crown, and the jury were thus completed and sworn.

The jury were then charged with
the prisoner on the before-mentioned indictment, and the case having been
closed and summed up, the jury retired to consider their verdict.

The case of Mansell v. The Queen ([18]) has been
much pressed upon us, but, so far from sustaining the action of the judge in
this case, it is, in my opinion, quite the contrary. The question there was,
not the necessity for the crown to show cause on the second perusal of the
panel, but whether the panel had been gone through without calling the jurors
who were out on another trial, and who came in after the names of the jurors in
court had been called, and the court held that they were properly called
because the

[Page 423]

panel had not been exhausted although
once called over. Cockburn, C.J. says in this case, page 104:

It appears that before 4 stat. 33 Ed. 1, the crown, either by
prerogativc or by usurpation exercised the power of peremptory challenge
without restriction as to number; and if that power was exercised so that
twelve jurors did not remain, the inquest went off for that cause. To meet this
evil the act was passed. On the enactment a practice was grafted by which, on
the counsel for the crown intimating his intention to challenge one of the
jurors, he was not put to assign cause at once, but the juror was set aside
until the panel was gone through to ascertain if enough of persons not objected
to might not be found to make a jury, If the panel was large this, in effect,
was equivalent to a peremptory challenge. In one of the early state trials,
Firzharris's case ([19]) the
Chief Justice uses language as if in practice at that time this privilege was
not confined to the crown, but that either side might set aside the juror and
afterwards take their exceptions. But, be that as it may, it must he admitted
by everyone that it is now settled by overwhelming authority that where it is
proposed to object to a juror, the counsel for the crown have the right to have
the man set aside until it is seen if without him there will be jurors enough
to try the prisoner, and that it is not until the panel is gone through that
cause need be shown. That being so, the question is reduced to this : When is
the panel gone through ? Is it as soon as the names have been called over ? Or
is it not until every proper attempt has been made to secure the presence of
those on the panel whose duty it is to attend ? In the present case the panel
had been called over, properly omitting the names of twelve who were known to
be justifiably absent, the calling of whose names would have been an idle
ceremony, and enough persons did not remain to form a jury. Iremonger's name is
again called; and before anything more is done the twelve absent jurymen come
in. It is not disputed that they were duly qualified jurymen and on the list;
but it is contended that the list having been once gone through, it must be
gone through again in the same order as before But it being conceded that the
crown is not put to show cause for its challenge till the panel is gone
through, it seems to me very clear that the panel was not gone through till
those twelve names of available jurymen were called.

The learned Chief Justice then discusses the case of lremoæger
which is not applicable to this case.

The meaning of standing aside being a challenge by

[Page 424]

the crown, the consideration of the challenge should not
proceed until it could be seen whether a full jury Can be got
without there being others on the panel. in this Dominion it is not now matter
of practice or indulgence or concession, but as I have said a right re cognised
by statute, a right of which no court, in my opinion, can deprive a prisoner.
In this case I think there was a distinct abridgement of the rights of the
prisoner. If the crown can order a juror to stand aside on a second perusal of
the panel, why may they not do it a third or a fourth time, it fact
indefinitely until a jury was selected to suit the prosecuting officer, a case
similar to what was pointed out by Lord Campbell in the Mansell case as follows
([20]) :—

Our judgment chiefly depends upon the right construction of
the ancient statute 4 stat. 33 Ed. 1 entitled "" An ordinance for
Inquests, "" which was re-enacted by 6 G. 4 c. 50 s. 29. An abuse had
arisen in the administration of justice by the crown assuming an unlimited
right of challenging jurors without assigning cause, whereby inquests remained
"" untaken."" In this way the crown could in an arbitrary
manner, on every criminal trial, challenge so many of the jurors returned on
the panel by the sheriff that twelve did not remain to make a jury; and the
trial might be indefinitely postponed pro defectu juratorum, to the
great oppression of the subject, and contravention of the words of Magna Charta
([21]).
Nulli differemus rectum vel justitiam. The remedy was to give to the
party accused a right to be tried by the jurors summoned upon his arraignment,
if after the limited num ber of challenges to which he was entitled without
cause assigned,there remained twelve iurors of those returned upon the panel to
whose qualification and unindifferency no specific objection to be proved by
legal evidence could be made. To prevent the trial going off for want of jurors
by the peremptory challenges of the crown it is enacted that ""they that
sue for the King,"" ""shall assign of their challenge a cause certain
and the truth of the same challenge shall be inquired of a cord ing to the
custom of the court."" 33rd there was no intention of tak ing away all
power of peremptory challenge from the crown, while that power to the number of
thirty-five, was left to the prisoner. Indeed, unless this power were given
under certain restrictions to both sides it is quite obvious that justice could
not be satisfactorily admin-

[Page 425]

istered; for it must often happen that a juror is returned on
the panel who does not stand indifferent, and who is not fit to serve upon the
trial, although no legal evidence could be adduced to prove his unfitness. The
object of the statute is fully attained if the crown be prevented from
exercising its rower of peremptory challenge, so as to make the trial go off
while there are twelve of those returned upon the panel who cannot be proved to
be liable to a valid objection. Accord ingly the course has invariably been,
from the passing of the statute to the present time, to permit the crown to
challenge without cause till the panel had been called over and exhausted and
then to call over the names of the jurors peremptorily challenged by the crown
and to put the crown to assign cause, so that, if twelve of those upon the
panel remain as to whom no just cause of objection can be assigned, the trial
may proceed. In our books of authority, the rule is laid down that the King
need not show any cause of his challenge till the whole panel be gone through,
and it appear that there will not be a full jury without the person so
challenged.

Willes J. in Exchequer Court ([22]), citing 4 Blackstone Com. 353,

The king need not assign his cause of challenge until all the
panel is gone through, and unless there cannot be a full jury without the
person so challenged, and then, and not sooner, the king's counsel must show
the cause or otherwise the juror shall be sworn.

I think, therefore, in this
case there was an assumption on the part of the officer of an unlimited right
of challenging jurors without assigning cause. The object of the law certainly is to secure the prisoners a fair trial How
can this be accomplished if he is deprived of the privilege the law gives him
in the selection of the jury by whom he is to be tried ?

I take the liberty to adopt the
language of Lord Campbell C. J. in Reg. v. Bird ([23]) where he says : —

I should feel deep regret if a great offender were to escape
punishment, but the due administration of criminal justice requires that the
forms of judicial procedure should be observed, these forms are devised for the
detection of the guilty and for the protection of the innocent

In the present instance the
objection taken is

[Page 426]

not raised on a mere technicality but is that the jury to whom
the prisoner shall be given in charge shall be legally selected, chosen and
sworn, and that neither the crown nor the prisoner shall have any advantage or
privilege other than those conferred by law; but when privileges are conferred
by law they shall be rigidly respected.

Believing then as I do, that the prisoner has not had a legal
trial I cannot by my voice send him to the gal lows. Had I any doubt in the case
I should in favorem vitce give the prisoner the benefit of such a doubt.

STRONG J. In the
case of Brisebois v. The Queen ([24])
the meaning of section 259 of the Criminal Procedure Act ([25]), was under
consideration, and I there had occasion to consider what constituted a question
of law arising on the trial which could be reserved pursuant to the terms of
that section. I was then of opinion that any matter or question of law which
arose before the judge presiding at a criminal trial, though it might arise before
the empanelling of the jury was complete, and therefore before the prisoner was
given in charge, was a question of law susceptible of being reserved under the
section in question, and the dissenting judgment which I then delivered was
based on this view of the construction of the statute.

This opinion was founded upon the English authorities and also
upon what I considered to be the mean ing properly to be attributed to the word
"" trial l as used in this section 259. It appeared to me that this word was
not to be restricted in its meaning to that portion of the proceedings which
strictly and technically constitute the trial, namely, that part of the
proceedings which does not begin until after the jury have been (to use a
technical expression) "" selected tried and

[Page 427]

sworn, "" and which is initiated when the officer of the
court (in the language of Sir James Stephen) ([26])
in cases of treason and felony gives the prisoner in charge to the Jury,
stating the effect of the indictment or inquisition, and the prisoner's plea of
not guilty and charging them to determine whether he is guilty or not. The
opinion I formed in Brisebois' case was that a much larger and more
liberal interpretation of the words "" which arises on the trial, should be
adopted, and that what seemed to be the English practice should be followed,
viz., that the word "" trial l was not to be confined to its strict
technical signification but that as in England the
statute should be interpreted as applying to all proceedings on or incidental
to the trial, including the preliminaries of the trial as well as proceedings
subsequent to the verdict. I confess, so far as my own individual opinion goes,
I still remain of the same mind and if I was unfettered by authority, I should
hold that the question of law involved in the challenges the allowance of which
has been assigned as error in the present case, were questions which might have
been reserved under section 259.

I am not, however free to act on this opinion for the reason
that a majority of the court in Brisebois' case according to my reading
of the reported judgments then delivered, held otherwise. There the objection
was that a juror whose name was oil the
panel had been personated by a person whose name was not on the panel. This
personation was not discovered until after a verdict of guilty had been found
and recorded, when it was raised for the first time, whereupon the learned
judge who presided at that trial reserved it and stated a case under the statute
for the determination of the Court of Ardeal It was held that under these
circumstances the question

[Page 428]

of law so reserved was not one arising on the trial and
therefore was not properly a matter which could be reserved under sec. 259. I
cannot regard this decision of the court otherwise than as overruling my own
opinion expressed in Brisebois' case to the effect already stated. The
judgment in the case referred to is therefore, I
conceive, an authority binding me, irrespective of my own opinion to construe
the word "" trial l strictly. It is true that there the objection was taken
not as here before the trial commenced but after the verdict had been recorded
and therefore after the trial had in strictness been concluded and it was
therefore held to be too late to be reserved under the act But if we are to construe the word "" trial"" strictly as regards
objections taken after its conclusion, we must also do the same as regards
questions of law which arise before its commencement. Moreover the real
objection in 'Brisebois' case, the real question of law which it was
held could not have been there reserved, arose before the commencement of the
trial though it was not discovered until afterwards.

As I am thus precluded by authority from following my own
judgment as to what I consider to be the proper interpretation of sec. 259, I
have no alternative but to abide by the only other construction possible,
namely, that which has been stated by the Chief Justice in the judgment he has
just delivered and which attributes to the word ""trial "" its strictly
legal and technical meaning. I must therefore hold that the question raised by
this writ of error was one which could not have been reserved at the trial It
follows that the writ of error in the present case does not come within the prohibition
contained in sec. 266.

It remains to be considered whether the decision of the
learned judge at the trial in sustaining the objection of the counsel for the
crown to

[Page 429]

eleven of the jurors who had on the
first calling over of the panel been ordered by the crown to stand aside was
erroneous in law. I am of opinion that this ruling, having regard to section
164 of the Criminal Procedure Act, which limits the right of the crown to order
jurors to stand aside only until the panel has been once gone through, was
substantially an allow once of eleven peremptory challenges, and therefore the
crown not having the right to challenge peremptorily that number of jurors, the
objections to more than four of those jurors were unwarranted by law and
consequently the court erred in allowing them. Upon the authorities and for the
reasons already fully stated by the Chief Justice, and which I need not repeat,
I am of opinion that the crown upon an indictment for felony is by the 164th
sec. of the Procedure Act limited to the challenge of four jurors peremptorily
and without cause, a number which was indisputably exceeded in the present
case.

There being, therefore, upon the face of the record a
judgment, not merely a ruling upon a point of practice within the discretion of
the judge, but what is strictly a judgment which is manifestly erroneous as
regards seven of the eleven jurors who were ordered to stand aside the second
time, I hold that this is a proper subject for a writ of error. Upon this point
again 1 am entirely of accord with the Chief Justice, and adopting the reasons
he has given and relying on the authorities he has quoted my judgment must be
for the prisoner. I may add that upon this last point 1 regard a passage in the
judgment of Lord Tenterden, Chief Justice in the King v. Edmonds ([27]) as decisive.
Lord Tenterden there says;

It must further be observed that the disallowing of a
challenge is a ground not for a new trial, but for what is strictly and
technically a

[Page 430]

venire de novo. The party
complaining thereof applies to the court, not for the exercise of the sound and
legal discretion of the judges, but for the benefit of an imperative rule of
law, and the improper granting or the improper refusing of a challenge is alike
the foundation of a writ of error.

I am of Opinion, therefore, that there has been a mistrial and that
the appeal must be allowed and a venire de novo awarded.

FOURNIER
J. Le jugement soumis à la révision de cette cour a été prononcé par la Cour
du Banc de la Reine, à Montréal, dans la cause de la Reine contre Herménigilde
Morin, sur un bref d'erreur, pour faire déclarer nul le verdict dé meurtre,
rendu contre le prisonnier dans le terme de mars de la Cour Criminelle, à
Montmagny.

Plusieurs moyens ont été
assignés pour l'obtention de ce bref, mais il n'en a été invoqué qu'un seul
devant cette cour. Il est énoncé comme suit °.

"" Que lors de la formation du petit jury, les personnes
suivantes, savoir : Louis Sénéchal, Joseph Pouliot, François Vézina,
Augustin Vézina, François Pouliot, Eugene Hamond, Louis Colin, Salomon Brochu, Joseph Labrecque, Evariste
Leclerc, Joseph Caron, Adoiphe Leclerc, Edmond Duquet et Alfred Fiset furent
récusés sans cause, par le couronne ""ordered
to stand aside.""

"" Qu'après que la liste des petits jurés eut été appelée
une fois, vu qu'il manquait encore un juré pour former le petit jury, la
couronne fit recommencer appel des æoms, et arrivé aux noms des personnes
susmentionnés elle les récusa encore sans cause. L'accusé alors objecta à ce
procédé, demandant que ha couronne fut tenue de montrer cause
pour cette seconde récusation.

""Que l'Hon.
Président du tribunal décida que
la couronne n'était pas obligée de montrer cause, tel que cela appert par le
record devant cette cour.""

[Page 431]

Lorsque le second appel
des jurés a eu lieu l'avocat de l'accusé a fait objection au droit réclame par
la couronne d'exercer une seconde fois la demande de ""stand aside "" et ii a Cté entré un jugement ainsi que le fait voir le dossier, rapporté
devant cette cour, déclarant que le juré pouvait être mis de côté une seconde
fois sur la demande de la couronne. Ce procédé a été répété pour onze jurés de
suite qui ont été ainsi mis de
côté une seconde fois par la cour sur Ta demande de l'avocat de la couronne,
jusqu'à ce qu'on arriva au douzième. La méme objection fut faite à chaque juré
et rejetée a chaque fois par la cour.

La liste des jurés
avait été appelée complètement une première fois (gone through) lorsqu'elle
le fut une sevconde fois et que
la cour décida que la Couronne avait droit a un second stand aside. Cette
décision est-elle légale ? C'est l'importante question que soulève le
présent appel.

La Cour du Banc de la
Reine, appelée à se prononcer sur cette question, s'est abstenue de lajuger sur
le principe qu'elle n'avait pas
de juridiction et a renvoyé le bref d'erreur en se basant sur la clause 266 du
ch. 1T4 des statuts criminels. Cette clause se lit comme suit
:

No writ of error shall be allowed in any criminal case unless
it is founded on some questions of law which could not have been reserved or which the judge presiding at the trial
refused to reserve for the consideration of the court having
jurisdiction in such cases.

Maintenant quel doit
être l'effet de cette disposition sur le bref d'erreur; est-elle
une prohibition absolue de l'émission de ce bref, à moins qu'il y ait eu une
question de droit que le juge présidant au procès aurait refuse de réserver, ou
encore, à moins que comme il est
dit dans la première partie de la clause 266
que le bref ne soit fondé sur quelque
question qui n'aurait Pu être réserve. Cette première partie de la section en
question ne semble pas à première vue offrir une significa- .

[Page 432]

tion bien facile à
saisir. On a dit qu'elle ne pourrait jamáis recevoir
d'application parée qu'il n'y a pas de question de droit soulevée au procès que
le juge présidant ne puisse réserver. Cela est vrai dans un sens restreint, et
pourvu que le juge en soit rendu au procès, ou trial

C'est évidemment ce que
comporte le texte de notre statut dans les deux seules sections où ii soit fait
mention des questions réserves. Par la section 266, pour qu'il y ait lieu
au bref d'erreur, ii faut que le refus du juge de réserver une question de droit alt eu lieu at the trial La section 259 du
même acte dit que la cour ou le juge présidant au procès peut réserver des
questions de droit et s'exprime ainsi i

May in its or his discretion, reserve any question of law
which arises on the trial for the consideration of the justices of the
court for Crown cases reserved.

La section 266 me paraît reconnaître deux catégories de cas où
le bref d'erreur peut être émis; les premières, ceux où la question de droit n'a Pu être réservée; la
seconde lorsque le juge présidant au procès a refusé de réserver la question.
D'après le texte ce n'est donc que lorsque le juge est an procès trial que
son refus de réserver une question de droit peut donner lieu au bref d'erreur
autrement ii n'en a pas le pouvoir.

Cette loi étant
dénature à restreindre les droits du sujet quant au bref d'erreur doit comme
toutes les lois restrictives, être strictement interprétée. Le mot trial, dont se sert le statut doit être considéré comme employé dans son sens
légal et technique, et signifie cette partie du procès de l'accusé qui commence
après l'assermentation du jury
auquel ii a été donné en charge, alors que commence l'examen des matières de
faits in issue en contestation. Cette partie de l'instruction forme le
procès trial par opposition aux procédures comme l'arraignment, l'appel des jurés, les récusa-

[Page 433]

tions des jurés et leur
procès par des tiers, qui ne sont que des procédures préliminaires.
Ces procédures ayant lieu avant que le "" trial"" ne soit commencé, on, ne peut pas dire que les
questions de droit qui pourraient s'élever pendant ces procédures préliminaires
puissent être considérées comme soulèves au procès-trial.

Ce n'est que lorsque le
juge en est rendu an trial que son
refus de réserver une question doit être constaté et qu'il donne alors lieu à
la demande d'un bref d'erreur Cette section 266 consacre une division de
la cause criminelle, qui
d'ailleurs est reconnue par les auteurs, en deux parties bien distinctes. La
première qui consiste en des procédures préliminaires commence à l'arraignment et finit à l'assermentation du jury; la deuxième, le "" trial,""
qui commence à
l'assermentation du jury et finit à la sentence. C'est pendant cette dernière
partie seulement que le refus du juge deréserver une question de droit peut donner
lieu à, l'émission du bref d'erreur. Comme ii n'est nullement question dans la
première partie de la section 266, de l'intervention du juge, les questions de
droit qui peuvent s'éléver alors au sujet des procédés ne sont nullement
affectées par la disposition restrictive de cette section
Celles qui peuvent s'élever dans cette partie de la procédure restent soumises
aux dispositions du droit an glais quant à l'émission du bref d'erreur, et il
peut être émis ici de la même manière qu'il le serait en Angleterre, sur des
questions de droit dans lesquelles il y aurait eu erreur suffisante. Le
jugement qui fait la matière du bref d'erreur, ayant été rendu lorsqu'on en
n'était encore qu'à l'appel des jurés, ne pouvait pas être réservé parce qu'il
a été rendu avant quo le procès trial ne fût commencé.

Pour établir la
distinction que je fais entre le trial et les procédures préliminaires,
je me base sur la haute

[Page 434]

autorité de Chitty's Criminal
Law. Il décrit ainsi le commencement du procès :

The .challenges being then completed and a full jury of
unexception able jurors by some of the means we have examined, being ready, the
clerk of the arraigns on the circuit proceeds to administer to each of them the
following oath : "" You shall well and truly try, and true
deliverance make between our Sovereign Lady the Queen, and . the prisoners at
the bar, whom you shall have in charge, and a true verdict give according to
the evidence-So help you God."" And the clerk of the arraigns directs the
crier to make proclamation which is made accordingly in the following form (see
form, p. 553.)

Cette proclamation a pour but d'informer tous ceux qui
peuvent avoir quelque
information à donner sur l'enquête entre Sa Majesté et le
prisonnier sur aucune trahison félonie on autre crime, d'avoir à se présenter
et qu'il seront éntendus, ainsi que tous ceux qui sont obliges par reconnaissance ou
obligation de rendre témoignage contre le prisonnier, de se présenter pour
donner leur témoignage, sous peine de forfaire leur cautionnement.

Chitty ajoute ce qui
suit à propros de cette proclamation :

But it is not necessary that this
proclamation, which is only for the benefit of the King, should appear on the
record, at least the defendant cannot take advantage of the omission. When this
proclamation has been read, the trial commences in the manner we shall presently consider.

When the jury have been thus assembled in the jury-box and
sworn, the clerk in case of felony calls to the prisoner at the bar, and bids
him hold up his hand by saying CD. and then addresses the jury in these words :
""Look upon the prisoner you that are sworn, and hearken to his
cause."" A. B. stands convicted, indicted by the name of A. B., etc.,
(reading the indictment). Upon this indictment he has been arraigned, upon this
arraignment he pleaded not guilty, and for his trial has put himself upon God
and the country which country you are. So that your charge is to enquire
whether he be guilty of the high treason Tor felony), whereof he stands
indicted, or not guilty.''

When the indictment has thus been read
and the jury addressed, if it is a cause of any importance, the indictment is
usually opened and the evidence arranged and examined and enforced by the
counsel for the prosecution, etc., etc.

[Page 435]

On volt que Chitty fixe
clairement le moment où commence
le procès : C'est
après la lecture de la proclamation appelant toutes personnes ayant des
informations à donner et tous témoins ou autres ayant des témoignages à rendre
contre le prisonnier, à se présenter pour être entendues, Sous peine de
forfaire leurs cautionnements. When, dit-il, this proclamation has been read, the trial commences in the manner we
shall presently consider. Cette
manière est indiquée dans les citations queje viens
de lire. En faisant application de cette division de la procédure d'un procès
criminel en deux parties, la première consistant dans les procédures
préliminaires et la seconde dans le trial proprement dit la sec. 266 devient
tout à fait intelligible et l'on comprend que il y a une partie de la procédure
où il ne peut y avoir de r€ifus de réserver une question de droit, c'est dans
la partie préliminaire. La première partie de la section 266, s'applique
évidemment à la question actuelle qui n'a été soulevée au sujet du stand aside, que dans la partie préliminaire de la procédure et
avant que le procès ne fût commencé. Interprétées de cette manière les deux
parties de cette clause peuvent recevoir leur application. La première
n'affecte nullement le droit du prisonnier d'obtenir un bref d'erreur parceque
la question n'a pu être réservée;
la seconde peut aussi recevoir
son effet s'il y a eu refus de réserver au procès on trial. Les deux
parties ont alors un sens complet et doivent recevoir leur effet

Dans la cause de Brisebois
v. La Reine la majorité de cette cour a adopté la
distinction des questions réservés au procès trial d'avec celles qui
n'ont pu l'être. Le juge en chef de cette cour, Sir Wiliiam Ritchie, C.J. s'est exprimé comme suit à ce sujet ([28]) :

I am of opinion this was not a question arising at the trial, but it was an objection raised
subsequent to the trial, and which could only

[Page 436]

be determined on a writ of error and
could not be reserved and disposed of in a summary manner by affidavits. I am
therefore of opinion that as this was not a question on the trial which could
be reserved, the Court of Queen's Bench in Montreal had no jurisdiction to
adjudicate on the case and, consequently, we have none, the prisoner's remedy,
if ' any, being by writ of error.

Cette doctrine ayant
été proclamée par la majorité de la cour forme un précédent auquel nous devons
nous conformer tant qu'il sera en force. En conséquence je crois que c'est avec
raison que le procureur général a donné son fiat pour l'émanation
du bref d'erreur sur le principe que la question du stand aside n'avait Pu être réservé.

Pour qu'un bref
d'erreur puisse être émané, il y a d'abord une formalité essentielle à remplir,
c'est d'obtenir le fiat du procureur général qu'il peut accorder ou
refuser à sa discrétion. lans l'exercice de ce pouvoir ii n'est en aucune manière
sujet au contrôle de la cour.

The court cannot control the exercise of the discretion left to the attorney general on this
subject ([29]). The
court will not interfere with the discretion of the Attorney General when he
has granted the writ ([30])

La restriction imposée par la section 266 ne devrait
elle pas être plutôt considérée comme adressée au procureur général et non à la
cour N'a-t-elle pas plutôt pour seul objet de servir de direction au procureur
général dans la considération de la question de savoir s'il accordera ou
refusera son fiat. Mais ayant jugé à propos de permettre
l'émission du bref sans y avoir impose aucune condition ou restriction, ne
doit-on pas conclure qu'après un mur examen des faits de la cause, le procureur
général a trouvé dans les refus répétés du juge d'obliger la couronne à montrer
cause pour les récusations répétées, un refus certainement équivalent an refus
de réserver la question. 11 a sans doute satisfait sa conscience que ce
refus d'ordonner de montrer

[Page 437]

cause était un refus
suffisant de réserver la question, surtout lorsque ce refus a été tuât de fois
répété.

It
cannot issue (the writ of error) now without a fiat from
the Attorney General, who always determines whether it be sought merely for
delay, or upon a probable error ([31]).

Maintenant que le bref est émis et qu'il est devant la cour sur une contestation
régulièrement liée et mettant directement en issue les défauts qu'il v a en
dans l'appel des jurés et dans les récusations, et sans qu'il y ait eu de
réponse en droit aux griefs d'erreur, ni aucune objection particulière
relativement au défaut de question réservée par le juge, la cour peut-elle éviter
de décider la question soulève, lors de La formation du jury sur la prétention
de la couronne à un second stand aside ? Elle ne le peut
pas, d'après toutes les autorités du droit anglais. Lorsqu'elle a le dossier
devant elle, elle doit non-seulement décider les questions d'erreur
particulièrement invoquées, mais elle doit aussi prendre connaissance de toute
question apparaissant par le dossier qui serait sufísante pour faire mettre de coté le verdict, lors même qu'il n'en aurait pas été pris
avantage par les griefs d'erreur. La cour n'est pas déchargée de ce devoir par
la section 266, qui n'a pas eu l'effet d'annuler ces dispositions
concernant le bref d'erreur.

La cour du Banc de la
Reine a plusieurs fois agi d'après ce principe eu maintenant des brefs d'erreur
pour des moyens non-assignés par
le demandeur, et qui u'avaient été ni réservés ni refuses en première instance.

Dans La cause de Regina
v. Ling ([32]), le
bref d'erreur a été maintenu pour une erreur qui n'avait pas été as signée et
au sujet de laquelle partant nulle question n'avait été réserve. Il s'agissait
:

D'un indictement pour parjure allégué avoir été commis dans une
certaine cause où un nommé Adrien Girardin, du township de
Kingsey,

[Page 438]

dans le district d'Arthabaska, commerçant, et un nommé Thomas Ling,
du même lieu farmer, était défendeur,
l'omission des mots était demandeur à la suite de la description de
Girardin, fut déclarée fatale et La conviction annulée. Cette omission n'avait
pas été mentionnée dans lee griefs d'erreur; elle ne fut signalée que par la cour elle-même.

La cour fonda son
opinion sur l'autorité suivante :

The
court is not limited to the errors assigned, the whole record is before the
court, and the prisoner has the right to the benefit of all substantial defects
in it and the conviction will be quashed if such defect exists. Regina v. Fox ([33]).

Puisque la cour nonobstant la section.266, est obligee de
prendre connaissance de toute erreur apparaissant à la face du
dossier, suffisante pour faire mettre de côté le verdict, la question Se
réduirait donc à décider si l'erreur commise lors de l'appel du jury était de
nature à affecter les droits du prisonnier.

La seconde récusation ou stand aside, accordée
à la couronne était-elle légale ? Peut-elle à son gré
faire répéter l'appel des jurés et les faire mettre de côté non seulement une
fois mais deux et même indéfiniment, de manière enfin vu le nombre limité que le prisonnier peut récuser à le forcer d'accepter son procès
devant un jury qui n'aurait pas le caractère d'impartialité voulu par la loi.

La loi a donné à la
couronne des garanties suffisantes pour assurer la bonne administration de la
justice, en lui permettant d'abord de demander le stand aside des jures jusqu'à ce que la liste ait été entièrement appelée, gone through; elle a en outre droit à quatre récusations
péremptoires qu'elle peut exercer sans en donner de motif en outre de celles pour lesquelles elle peut montrer des causes
suffisantes. Il serait donc injuste et illégal de lui accorder un privilège
comme celui du stand aside répété qui aurait l'effet d'anéantir le droit
de récusation du prisonnier, et, de laisser pratiquement

[Page 439]

à la couronne le
pouvoir de former le jury à sa guise, ou suivant l'expression anglaise to pack the jury.

Cette question s'est
déjà présente devant nos cours. La seule cause où l'affirmative du stand aside réDété ait été maintenue est celle de la Reine v. Lacombe ([34]). La
cour était composée de quatre juges, un seul, l'hon. juge Drummond a différé
d'opinion. En référant au rapport on voit que cette décision est fondée sur le
procèdent anglais dans l'affaire de Mansell ([35]), qui a
été interprété comme ayant décidé que la couronne avait droit à un second stand
aside. Ce n'est certainement pas La portée de la décision, et
elle n'est nullement applicable au cas actuel.

Dans la cause de
Mansell le rôle des jurés n'avait pas été Cpuisé, gone through. Onze jurés avaient été assermentes et ii en manquait
un douzième. Alors on recommença l'appel de la liste, et à l'appel du nom de Ironmonger l'avocat de la couronne demanda encore une fois le stand aside, pour ce juré déjà mis de côté une fois. Dans le même moment douze jurés
qui délibéraient sur un autre procès formant partie du même panel, rentrèrent
en cour pour donner leur verdict,
et se trouvèrent disponibles. La question du droit à un second stand aside était actuellement en discussion devant la cour.
Le stand aside de Ironmonoger ne fut maintenu que
temporairement parce qu'il fut alors représenté que La liste n'avait pas été épuisée,
gone through. En effet les douze jurés qui venaient
d'arriver en cour et qui n'avaient pas été appelés le furent alors. Jusque là
la liste n'avaient pas Cté épuisée, mais elle le fut après l'appel des noms de
douze jurés qui avaient été absents

Dans le
jugement de Lord Campbell C.J., après avoir exposé tous les faits, ii s'exprime
ainsi;

But we are of opinion that the panel is not
to be considered as
gone

[Page 440]

through
so as to require the crown to assign cause of challenge
till it is exhausted, i.e., according to the usual practice of the court
and what may reasonably he done the fact is ascertained that there are no .more
of the jurors on the panel whose attendance may be procured, and that, without
requiring the crown to assign cause of challenge the trial
could not proceed. In the present case the panel had not been exhausted,
although once called over, and the twelve jurors who had served on Chapman's jury came into court when only nine jurors had been
elected and sworn for Mansell's jury and when the remaining three might be
taken from three twelve as conveniently and as much for the advantage of the
prisoner as if they had all been in court and had answered to their names when
the panel was first called over.

Plus loin, page 397, Lord
Campbell ajoute :

Accordingly
the course has invariably been from the passing of the statute to the present
time, to permit the crown to challenge without cause till
the panel has been called over and exhausted, and then to call over the names
of the jurors peremptorily challenged by the crown and to put the crown to
assign cause so if twelve of those upon the panel remain as to whom no just
cause of objection can be assigned the trial may proceed. In our books of
authority the rule is laid down that ""The King need not show cause of his
challenge till the whole panel be gone through and it appear that three will
not be a full jury without the person so challenged.""

Cockburn C.J., après avoir
fait allusion aux différentes
manières d'appeler la liste des jurés, dit :

Here
they were called in the order on the panel; but the twelve absent jurymen were
not called, because it was known where they were and that it would be useless
to call then The panel then was not gone through so far as those twelve jurors
were concerned, it was not exhausted as to them. Now it being conceded that the
Crown was not bound to assign cause of challenge till the panel was gone
through it seems to me that it cannot be said that the panel was gone through
till those twelve jurymen had been called and the Crown and the prisoner
respectively had said whether they challenge them or not.

Willes J., dit
an sujet de la seconde demande destand aside ([36])
:

The application by the crown that Iremonger should stand by the
second trial was a continuance of a previous objection, a demand for further
time to show cause rather than a fresh challenge * and in
my opinion the panel had not then been gone through, so as to make it incumbent
on the crown to show cause of challenge.

[Page 441]

Chamell B., dit : ([37]).

The
main question is whether the panel was perused when Ire-monger was called the
second time; I think it was not, and that the time to put the crown to show
cause of challenge had not then arrived

Chitty, Crim. Law, ([38]).

But
it is agreed that under this statute, the crown is not compelled to show any
cause of challenge until the panel is gone through, so that it may appear that
three will not he sufficient to try the prisoner, if the peremptory objection
is admitted to prevail.

Lors de l'arrivé des
douze jurés qui n'avaient pas été appelés le stand aside do Ironmonger n'avait pas été décidé, et au lieu de décider cette
question, le juge qui présidait permit d'appeler les douzc jurés qui venaient
d'entrer et le jury put être complété. C'est done dans ces circonstances que
s'éleva-la question de savoir si le challenge de Ironmonger n'aurait pas dû être décidée et la couronne obligée de montrer cause.
Mais le juge décida que la liste n'avait pas été Puisée, gone through vu l'arrivée de douze nouveaux jurés. Cette décision
fut confirmée par les juges de la cour du Banc de La Reine dont l'opinión est citée ci-dessus Il ne fut nullement décidé que la
couronne avait droit à un second stand
aside. On voit au contraire que l'opinion des juges est contre
cette proposition; ils ont admis le principe énoncé par le
premier juge que la liste des jurés devait être Puisée., gone through, avant de forcer la couronne à montrer cause pour ses
récusations. Ce précédent qui a servi de base à ladécision de la Reine v.
Lacombe, n'a done nullement décidé que la couronne avait
doit à plus d'un stand aside, tout au
contraire, l'opinion des juges a été qu'une fois la liste épuisée, gone through, au deuxième appel des jurés, la couronne doit donner
ses causes de récusation. C'est done à tort que la cour du Banc de la Reine
s'est appuyée sur

[Page 442]

ce procèdent pour
maintenir dans La cause de Lacombe que la couronne avait droit à un
deuxième stand aside. Ce procèdent êtant encore en force lors de la
décision de l'hon, juge dans cette cause, ii n'est pas surprenant qu'il s'y
soit conforme, car c'était une décision de sa propre cour. Mais ce procèdent
est isolé; ii n'en existe pas un seul de cc genre en Angleterre.
Cockburn C. J. dit à ce sujet :

There is no case in the books by which it appears that a juror
who lias been once set aside at the instance of the crown has been again set
aside at the instance of the crown without cause of challenge being shown.

Dans La cause de Regina v. Dougall
([39]), La
moitié ne peut seulement de la liste avait été appelée et la décision
s'appliquer au cas actuel où toute la liste avait été appelée.

Il n'existe pas non
plus dans Ontario de cas où ii ait été décidé que la liste pouvait être appelée
deux fois avant que la Couronne
put être obligée à donner ses causes de récusation. Dans Regina v. Benjamin
([40]), on
attribue à M. Richards qui représentait la Couronne le langage suivant à ce
sujet :

Then in going over the panel a second time
the crown must assign a cause certain, which is then inquired of by the court.

Il semble avoir exprimé
l'opinion dominante sur cette
question, dans la province d'Ontario, car on ne trouve nulle part la
contradiction de cette doctrine.

“Bishop on Criminal Procedure” ([41]), résume
bien la doctrine comme suit :

The course of things is, therefore, in
England and in those States of the Union in which the English practice
prevails, for the court, when the list of jurors is being called over and the
prisoner is being required to accept or challenge each juror, to direct such
jurors to stand aside as are objected to on behalf of the
prosecution. The panel is thus
gone through with.  But if a full jury is not thus obtained, then the

[Page 443]

panel is called over a second time,
omitting those whose cases have been finally disposed of, yet including both
those who did not answer and those who were set aside at the instance of the
prosecution, and on this second call the Government can challenge only for
cause.

Ici sont cités plusieurs précédents anglais, et entr'autres Regina v. Mansell.

Toutes les autorités
font clairement voir que la Couronne doit au deuxième appel des jurés, après
avoir exercé le stand aside une fois, montrer cause pour ses récusations.
C'est ce que le juge a positivement refuse de faire en cette cause onze fois de
suite. La liste des jurés avait alors toute été appelée une première fois tel que le constate le record. L'absence de ceux qui
n'avaient pas répondu à l'appel fut régulièrement notée et il n'y a aucune
preuve qu'aucun de ces jurés fut présent en cour lors du second appel. Il n'y
avait donc absolument aucune raison de faire le second appel Si ce n'est pour
donner à La Couronne le privilège du second stand aside auquel elle n'avait aucun droit

Cette erreur commise
dans la constitution du jury peut avoir eu les plus graves conséquences pour le
prisonnier. Elle est en violation de La loi qui exige la plus stricte
impartialité dans la formation du
jury, et est une cause suffisante
d'erreur pour faire annuler le procès S'il en était autrement, je dirais avec
Cockburn C. J., dans la cause de Mansell:

It would be monstrous to common sense to affirm that where it
is admitted that three has been an improper selection of the jury the prisoner
shall have no remedy; and if it is not a ground of error three is no remedy, as
a bill of exception will not lie in a case of felony.

En conséquence je suis d'avis que le bref d'erreur doit être maintenu.

TASCHEREAU
J.—I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed on the ground
taken by the Court of Queen's Bench, that the question raised by the prisoner
on the order given by the learned judge, at the trial, to eleven

[Page 444]

jurors to stand aside a second time at the instance of the
crown could have been reserved, and that con sequently, under section 266 of
the Procedure Act as the judge did not refuse to reserve it the writ of error
does not lie. The proposition that the question is one that could have been
reserved has been so elaborately treated by my brother Patterson that I might
content myself with concurring in his remarks. In fact, were it not for the
opinions expressed here to-day I would have thought the point free from any
doubt. And, I venture to say if the learned judge at the trial in this case had
reserved the question it would never have been thought of,
either at the bar or on the bench, to question his right to do so. The eminent
counsel himself who argued the case before us for the plaintiff in error did
not feel justified in taking the ground that the question was one which could
not have been reserved. And Mr.. Justice Tessier, in the
Court of Queen's Bench, who dissented from the judgment of the court on other
points far from holding that the question could not have been reserved, on the
contrary, assumes that it could have been.

To the cases which will be cited by my brother Patterson on
this proposition, I add the following : Levinger v. The Queen, in
the Privy Council ([42]);
Reg. v. Manning ([43]);
Beg. v. Burgess ([44]);
also, Reg. v. Tew ([45])
where the question reserved was whether the witnesses
before their examination before the grand jury had been properly sworn, a
question which, Lord Campbell said, as presented in the case, was unfounded,
frivolous and discreditable, but upon which, however, the court assumed
jurisdiction.

Now here was a case reserved on a proceeding before even a
bill had been found by the grand jury.

[Page 445]

It is an extreme and perhaps a questionable one. I cite it
however to show how far the courts in England. have gone in the construction of
the court of crown cases reserved act. See also Reg. v. Key ([46]); and Reg.
v. Shutlleworth ([47])
* in which questions were reserved on the mode of arraignment where a previous
conviction is charged.

In New Brunswick the case
of The Queen v. Morríson ([48]);
and in Quebec, amongst others, the cases R.
v. Lacombe ([49])
R. v. Fraser ([50]) and R. v.
Chamailard ([51]), may also be referred to.

Then, in this court itself, there are two cases in point. In Abrahams
v. The Queen ([52]) the prisoner had moved to quash the indictment on the
ground that it had been submitted to the grand jury without proper authority,
it being one falling under the vexatious indictments clause now sec. 140 of the
Procedure Act. It appeared that the indictment purported to have been
authorised by the attorney-general, but that this had been done, not by the
attorney-general himself but by the counsel who represented him at that term of
the court. After conviction the presiding judge reserved the question so raised
on the motion to quash. The Court of Queen's Bench, in Montreal, held that the
objection was not well founded. But on appeal to this court that judgment was
reversed, and the indictment was quashed.

Now that was clearly an objection not
only arising but also taken before a jury was made up, nay, even before the
prisoner pleaded to the indictment as it must necessarily have been under
section 143 of the Procedure Act. Yet it was never questioned either at

[Page 446]

the bar or on the bench either
in the Court of Queen’s Bench, or in this court, but that the case was on which
was properly reserved. Are we here to-day to hold that we had no right to quash
the conviction i that case as we did? A question precisely similar in England,
I may add, in R. v. Fuidge ([53]) was reserved and the indictment also quashed by the full court; and there also it was nowhere doubted that the
question was one which was properly reserved.

The other case in this court I
have alluded to i Theal v. The Queen ([54]). One
of the points reserved by the judge who had presided at the trial in that
case was upon a motion to quash the indictment which had been moved by the
prisoner, upon arraign ment before pleading. The case went through the full Court
of New Brunswick and then was appealed here and not a doubt either in New
Brunswick o; here was expressed as to the jurisdiction of the cour of crown cases reserved upon the point raised by the
motion to quash.

It has been suggested that by
the giving to the word "" trial"" in section 259 of the Procedure Act
the wide interpretation that it has to the pre present day unquestionably
received in England and in Canada, prisoners in criminal cases by section 266
o; this same Act will be deprived in many cases of the beneficial right to a
writ of error. That is so, undoubtedly, but in my opinion such is the clear
intention of the statute. It was thought expediet not to allow the two remedies
to a prisoner the writ of error and the reservation for the court of crown cases
Neither one nor the other it must be observed is grantable as a matter of
right. The attorney general, it is true would not refuse his fiat for a writ of
error where a serious ground of error is assigned, though he

[Page 447]

should be careful not to grant it where it is expressly taken
away by the statute. But it is equally true that the judge presiding at the
trial not only would not refuse to reserve but even of himself and ex
propriomotu would reserve, any question of law upon which he might have serious
doubts. And a reference to the cases in the court of crown cases reserved both
in England and in Canada, since its establishment fully shows that the judges
presiding at trials of criminal cases have as the full court itself, given the
widest interpretation to the statute, and liberally exercised in favor of
accused parties the powers it conferred upon them whenever serious doubts arose
on any question of law. And then, in the case now before us how could it be
said that a question whether the prisoner has had his trial according to law or
by a jury lawfully constituted, is not a question arising at the trial?

In a late case, 1889, Reg. v. Brown ([55]), Lord
Coleridge reserved a case not only after the trial, but even after the term of
the court had ended and after he had left the assize town and this where the
prisoner had pleaded guilty, and the full court held that they had
jurisdiction. Referring to a previous case, Reg. v. Clark ([56]) where
it had been held that no case can be reserved when a prisoner pleads guilty,
the Chief Justice, for the court, said :—

If that judgment intends that because a man pleads guilty—the
judge who tried the case cannot state a case asking for the opinion of this
court as to the validity of the conviction, we must respectfully differ from it
In this case the indictment was read to the prisoner and if, upon it being
read, he had taken the objection, it would clearly
have been a point arising at the trial; and the mere fact that he did not take
it but that it arose in the mind of the judge afterwards does not tender it any
less a point which arose at the trial Whether it was taken by the prisoner or
not, it existed, and the point was there. We think, therefore, that we have
jurisdiction to consider this case.

[Page 448]

Now we have in that case the latest instance, and I may say
perhaps one of the most illustrative, of the liberality with which in England
the statute applying to the
court of crown cases reserved has been inter preted. And when we are asked here
today, by the construction sought to be given to curtail the jurisdiction of
that court, and to put upon this highly remedial statute a narrower
construction than it has received for over forty years, I think we should pause
before coming to that conclusion. We should
be loath to abridge rights and remedies which have proved so effectual in the
administration of the criminal law and so well calculated to ensure to accused
parties the protection the law of the land entitles them to on their trial

A reference has been made
to Brisebois v. The Queen ([57]) as a decision by this court from which
it could be inferred that we had refused to adopt the large construction given
to the word ""trial"" in sec. 259 of the Pro cedure Act in prior cases.
Now I am sure that neither his lordship nor my brother Gwynne, who with myself
composed the majority of the court in that case on the question, whether the
question there submitted had legally been reserved or not, intended to question
Abra hams v. The Queen ([58]) and Theal
v. The Queen ([59])
which I have referred to or in any manner throw the least doubt upon the
jurisdiction of this court in those cases.

That case of Brisebois has no application whatever to the
present one. There the learned judge presiding at the trial after the verdict
on a motion in arrest of judgment had illegally, as we thought, tried, upon
affidavits a question of fact, which not only did not appear on the record but which was in direct
contradiction of the record. The error assigned there, if any there was or
could he legally proved, was error in fact.

[Page 449]

Now, we held that this was irregular, that no motion in arrest
of judgment lies upon a fact not appearing on the record, and that the learned
judge had no power after verdict to receive affidavits and try an issue of fact
to contradict the record as he had done ([60])
and that consequently he could not, assuming these facts as proved, reserve a
question of law upon them. Bowsse v. Cannington ([61]). I need only
refer to the remarks of my brother Gwynne who gave the judgment of the court
upon this point, at page 454 of the report, to show that this was all that was
determined in that case.

I have also great doubts if an order to a juror to stand
aside, which merely means that the juror being challenged by the crown the
consideration of the challenge shall be postponed till it be ascertained
whether or not a full jury can be made without him ([62]) raises a
question of law upon which the writ of error lies. I refer on this point to Gregory
v. Reg. ([63]),
Mansell v. Reg. in the Court of Exchequer Chamber ([64]) Whe Ian v.
Reg. ([65])
and the cases there cited also to Chief Justice Harrison's judgment in R. v.
Smith ([66]). Section 124
of the Criminal Law Procedure Act it has been suggested, would have the effect
now to make in Canada such a question one of law. But, as it would seem to me
the only new enactment in that section is the allowance of four peremptory
challenges to the crown; the subsequent words, "" but this shall not be
construed to affect the right of the crown to cause any juror to stand aside
until the panel has been gone through,"" import no changes in the law or
practice as to the order to "" stand aside."" I read the clause as

[Page 450]

if it said : The crown shall have four peremptory challenges
but this shall not interfere with the right of the crown to cause any juror to
stand aside which right shall continue to exist as it has existed heretofore. I
am confirmed in this view by section 170 of the same act which enacts that :

Nothing in this act shall alter, abridge or affect any power
or authority which any court or judge has, when this act takes effect, or any
practice or form in regard to trials by jury, jury process, juries or jurors,
except in cases where such power or authority is expressly altered, or is
inconsistent with the provisions of this act.

The order given by the judge at the trial which the plaintiff
in error impugns, it must be remembered, is not an allowance of a peremptory
challenge at the instance of the crown to which a demurrer raising a question
had been pleaded by the prisoner but merely an order on a challenge for cause
by the crown, which postponed the consideration of the challenge till it was
ascertained whether a full jury could not be had without the juror so
challenged, and to which the prisoner had objected in the only way he could do,
by asking that the crown be ordered to show cause forthwith, and I find it
difficult to say that this raised a question of law that could be the ground of
a writ of error.

However, it is unnecessary for me to determine this point, as
upon the ground I first mentioned I am of opinion that the judgment appealed
from, which quashed this writ, was right, and that the appeal by the plaintiff
in error should be dismissed.

Having come to this determination it seems to me that I should
not enter into the consideration of the merit of the ground of error assigned
by the plaintiff in error. As we are equally divided in this court the result
is that the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench which held that the writ of
error does not lie, stands. It follows, it

[Page 451]

seems to me, that anything 1 would say here on the merits
would be obiter and extra judicial. If the Writ of error does not lie,
as results from the judgment of this court, I do not see how I would be
justified in giving a judgment on the errors assigned, and assume jurisdiction
after our judgment determines that we have no jurisdiction. The course pursued
in the court below where the learned judges refrained from going into the
merits is the proper one, in my opinion ([67]).
However, as a majority of my brother judges have expressed their opinions that
the error assigned as to the order to certain jurors to stand aside a second
time at the instance of the crown is a good ground of error, I deem it right to
make an observation as to the course pursued by the learned counsel who acted
for the attorney general, and by the learned judge who presided at the trial in
this case. In 1869 in a case of Reg. v. Lacombe ([68]) the full
Court of Queen's Bench, in Montreal, upon a case reserved, held that on the
second calling over of a jury list under circumstances precisely similar to the
present one the crown had the right to have a juror stand aside a second time
without showing cause. Now, it is obvious that with this ruling of the highest
court of the province before him the learned counsel for the crown in this case
was perfectly justified to take the course he did at the trial and that the
learned judge who presided could not have been expected, acting there as he was
in the capacity of a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench, to assume the
responsibility of reversing a jurisprudence settled by that court over twenly
years before, and which had remained unchallenged ever since. I can.see nothing
on this record to create the least doubt but that this prisoner got a fair
trial. The right of challenging is given to reject, not

[Page 452]

to select and as seven of his peremptory challenges were not taken he must be assumed to have
been tried. by a jury composed of twelve men indifferent, properly qualified,
and to none of whom he had any objection.

GWYNEE J.—The objection taken in this case, if it should
prevail, must do so upon the ground that there was such a substantial defect in
the formation of the jury as constituted a mistrial, such a defect, therefore
as would have entitled the crown to have avoided the verdict if it had been one
of acquittal. This consideration makes it a matter of the gravest importance in
the interest of the accused parties that whenever a question of mistrial is raised
care should be taken that mere irregularities not working any prejudice to the
accused upon his trial shall not be magnified into nullities avoiding a trial.
It is not every irregularity upon the trial of a person upon a criminal charge
that will constitute a mistrial. It would be most disastrous as well to the due
administration of the law as to the interest of the accused parties themselves
if it should do so. The language of several of the learned judges in Mellor's
Jase ([69])
is very applicable to the present case. Crompton J, referring to the point in
that case, says :

It would be very mischievous if every irregularity of this
nature would necessarily vacate a verdict; if it would necessarily have that
effect the same principle would apply in the case of an acquittal even though
the irregularity were caused by the prosecution. The extreme
mischief should make us cautious in seeing that the strict rules of law
are not extended in such a manner that at every assizes and sessions we should
be in danger of hearing of verdicts being set aside by accidental or contrived
irregularities like those in question.

Crowder J. says :

Verdicts found at the assizes and quarter sessions after the
most 

[Page 453]

patient and careful investigation where
the trials have been with the utmost impartiality, and the results have been
most satisfactory to the ends of justice, might be set aside and the
prisoners, if convicted, might have another chance of
escape, or if acquitted might have their lives and liberties again imperiled by
another trial, for if such a mistake is fatal to the trial it is equally so
whether the verdict pass for or against the prisoner, and whatever the nature
of the crime may be with which he is charged.

Willes J. says :

If this was a mistake, the Prisoner being convicted, it would
equally have been a mistrial in case of
acquittal; but to order a venire de novo in the latter case would be scandalous and
oppressive.

And Byles J. says :

A mere possibility of prejudiece cannot vitiate the trial. A mistake of this nature is no mistrial. If a mistake of
this nature vitiates a verdict against a prisoner, it equally vitiates a
verdict for him. The crown may at any time and at any distance of time take similar objections, and the validity of all
acquittals is put in jeopardy.

Now, what is objected to in the present case is simply this :
Upon the panel of 40 jurors being once called three did not answer to their
names when called and twelve having been peremptorily challenged by the prisoner,
and fourteen required to stand aside by the crown when eleven jurors only were
obtained and sworn the clerk then, instead of calling again the three who had
not answered to their names, proceeded to go through the panel again in the
same order as before only omitting those who had been peremptorily challenged,
when the crown, upon the persons they had required to stand aside being again
called in their order as before, again prayed that the period for assign ing
cause might be further postponed until the panel should be once again thus gone
through, and the learned judge decided in favor of the crown, against the
contention of the prisoner's counsel that the crown should be compelled to
assign cause of challenge upon each of those who had been required to stand
aside being called again; in this manner, accordingly, the

[Page 454]

panel, excluding those who had been
peremptorily challenged by the prisoner, was once again gone through, until at
length, when it appeared that the three jurors who had been absent when first
called were still absent when called a second time in the order in which they
were upon the panel the twelfth juror was obtained by the crown no longer
requiring him to stand aside. To this juror so obtained the prisoner, although
he still had several challenges or rights of challenge remaining, offered no
objection and it is not alleged that in point of fact he had any objection to
him, and thus a complete jury was obtained. Now, if in such a case the crown
upon a verdict of acquittal being rendered should demand a venire de novo, upon the grounds of there having been such a defect
in the formation of the jury as constituted a mistrial, the language of Willes
J. in Mellow's case ([70])
may not inaptly be applied : ""To order a venire de
novo in such a case would be scandalous and oppressive;"" and if
the crown could not obtain a venire de novo in
the present case if a verdict of acquittal had been rendered the prisoner
cannot upon a verdict of guilty. So likewise I may adopt the language of Crowder
J. in the same case as eminently appropriate to the present, where he says :

Before I can arrive at the conclusion that a verdict found by
such a jury so empanelled is a nullity, I must be satisfied that there exists
some stringent and inflexible rule of law which goes the length of avoiding
every criminal trial when such a mistake however unattended with the slightest
mischief, has occurred, but I can find no such rule of law.

If a procedure such as that which is objected to in the
present case constituted a mistrial, the apprehensions entertained by By les J., as expressed by him in the same case may be said to be
fulfilled and henceforth, in this portion at least of the British Empire—

New trials in criminal cases will come in like a flood A mere pos


[Page 455]

sibility of prejudice cannot vititiate the trial. If a
procedure of the nature in question here vitiates a verdict against a prisoner
it equally vitiates a verdict for him. The crown may at any time and at any
distance of time take a similar objection, and the validity of all acquittals
is put in jeopardy.

It is in the interest of those accused of crime there-fore,
that we should hold that the procedure which is objected to in the present case
did not constitute a mistrial

The language of Bram well B. in Mansell's case ([71]), and which
was not dissented from by any of the learned judges in that case, has also an
important bearing upon the objection taken in the present case.

He there says :

According to my judgment the matter relied on to found the objection ought not to have appeared upon the record, and if it
is ex aminable it is not error.

Willes J. was of the same opinion, although he abstained from
pronouncing judgment upon it, because, as he said:

Assuming that a court of error ought to pronounce an opinion,
and that it is a matter properly upon the record, I am of opinion
that the judgment below ought to be affirmed.

Again, Bram well B. says:

It is now an application to the discretion of the judge
whether or not the showing of cause of challenge on the part of the prisoner
should be adjourned, and that is so reasonable that, I think, it ought to be
admitted. But the delay in showing cause on the part of the crown, which was
wholly discretionary at first has in accordance with the practice become a
right, and the judge would do wrong if he did not admit it as matter of right
to the crown. In my view, consistently with that, although the panel had been
gone through once, the judge might the second time, on reasonable ground, grant
the application of the crown to adjourn the showing cause of challenge, or
rather continue, at the request of the crown, to postpone the obligation of the
crown to show cause of its challenge. Still, I think that the application that
a juryman should be ordered to stand by is an application to the discretion of
the judge at the trial. Therefore, I am compelled

[Page 456]

to say that the story of it ought not to appear on the record,
nor can the discretion of the judge be reversed in a court of error.

And again he says :

So long as there are men in court on the panel who were called
before and had not answered, the necessity for the crown showing cause has not
arisen The rule must at least be this that until each man who could answer has
answered and there are still not twelve men in the box the crown need not show
cause.

That the crown was entitled to have called a second. time the
three men who had not answered when the panel was first called cannot, I think,
admit of any doubt; the objection, therefore, is reduced to this, that the
judge permitted the panel to be gone through again in the same manner as he had
been before, omitting those peremptorily challenged, in order to have the three
who had not answered called again in this manner before putting the crown to
show its cause of challenge. This mode of proceeding, if at all objectionable,
can only be objected to as a mere irregularity in procedure which did not
deprive the prisoner of any legal right, or do him any prejudice. It did not
result in putting upon the jury an unqualified person or one against whom the
prisoner had, or is suggested to have had, any objection whatever, and did not,
in my opinion, constitute a mistrial in whatever form the objection should be
raised. It is however sufficient for the determination of the present case to
say that the point raised involved a question of law, which, upon the English
authorities and practice, I entertain no doubt whatever could have been
reserved as a point of law arising on the trial for the consideration of the court
for crown cases reserved under sections 259, 260 and 261 of ch. 174
of the Revised Statutes of Canada. With great deference
to my brother Strong, the case of Brisbois v. The Queen ([72]) has, in my
opinion, no applica

[Page 457]

tion whatever in the present case. The points in judgment
there were that matter which arose after verdict and was brought to the notice
of the judge by affidavits and in such a manner that he could have rendered no
judgment upon it, was not matter raising a question of law arising on the
trial; and, moreover, that the objection taken was one which the statute
expressly declared could not be taken in any shape. In the Queen v. Burgess
([73]),
before plea pleaded, and therefore before ever a juror was sworn or called to
try the case, the prisoner's counsel moved to quash the indictment upon the
contention that though it professed to charge the prisoner with the offence of
compounding a felony it did not disclose any offence. The Recorder of London in
whose court the case was, overruled the objection, whereupon the prisoner
pleaded, was tried and had a verdict of guilty rendered against him and
thereupon the learned recorder reserved for the consideration of the court of
crown cases reserved the question :

Whether the indictment was bad on the face of it as not
disclosing any offence at law and ought to have been quashed?

The court of crown cases reserved entertained the case, and
adjudicated upon it. The question was deliberately argued upon the merits and
it never occurred either to counsel or to the court that the question was not
one which within the meaning of the act which gave the court jurisdiction,
arose on the trial, and that the court therefore had no jurisdiction to
entertain the case. In Regina v. Brown ([74]), Lord
Coleridge C. J., reserved a case for the consideration of the court for crown
cases reserved under the following circumstances: The prisoner had pleaded
guilty at assizes to an indictment charging him with having attempted to com-

[Page 458]

mit unnatural offences with domestic
fowls and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment. After the judge left .the
assize town his attention was called to an unreported case which was said to
have decided that a duck was not an animal within the meaning of 24 & 25
Vic ch. 100 s. 51, and he thereupon stated a case requesting the opinion of the
court for crown cases reserved whether or not the conviction was good ? When
pronouncing the judgment of the court, referring to Reg. v. Clark ([75]), Lord
Coleridge said:

If it is intended by that judgment that because a man pleads
guilty any difficulty with respect to the statement of the case against him is
immaterial,—that he is absolutely concluded for ever after from taking any
point upon it, and that the judge who tries him cannot state a case for the
opinion of this court, we respectfully differ from that view, and inasmuch as
the prisoner in the present case was indicted and the indictment was read to
him and he might then have taken the objection we think the objection was in
effect taken. The point was there existing; it might have been taken, and it
was a point which in our view did arise on the trial.

The court accordingly entertained the case and adjudicated
upon it. Without over-ruling these cases it is impossible in my opinion, to
hold that no question can be reserved for the consideration of the court for
crown cases reserved as one arising on the trial within the meaning of the
statute in that behalf unless it be in respect of some matter arising after the
jury is selected and sworn. Such a construction would be little short of making
null the statute. In the present case no case was reserved, and as the judgment
of the court appealed from proceeded upon the ground that, and substantially is
an adjudication that,in point of fact, as was also admitted in the argument,
the judge who tried the case never was asked or did refuse to reserve a case
upon the point for the consideration of the court for crown cases reserved
section 266 of ch. 174

[Page 459]

enacts that no writ of error shall be allowed in such a case
and so in effect that the objection cannot be now raised in error.

The appeal therefore should, in my opinion, be dismissed and
the ""judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, at Montreal, affirmed.

PATTERSON J. The writ of error has been quashed
by the judgment of the court below on the ground that it is founded on a
question of law arising at the trial which could have been reserved for the
consideration of the justices of the court for crown cases reserved under the
259th section of the Criminal Procedure Act ([76]),
but which the judge presiding at the trial did not reserve, and not having been
asked to reserve it, cannot be said to have refused to reserve. The decision
proceeds upon the 266th section which unlike the 259th is not taken from the
English law, and which declares that in those circumstances no writ of error
shall be allowed.

The alleged error is in the selection of the jury. When the
panel which contained the names of forty jurors had been once perused twelve
men had been challenged by the prisoner, fourteen had been ordered on the part
of the crown to stand by eleven had been sworn on the ""jury, and three
were absent. One jury man was still wanted and he had to be obtained from among
the fourteen men who were standing aside, unless all of the fourteen should
happen to be challenged either by the crown for cause, or, to the number of
four, peremptorily, as permitted by section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Act,
or by the prisoner who was still entitled to eight peremptory challenges. On
again going through the panel, one of the men was challenged by the prisoner,
and the crown was permit-

[Page 460]

ted, against the objection of the prisoner, to cause eleven of
them to stand by a second time. We obtain these facts from the return to the
writ of error, where it is further stated that one man of the fourteen was
sworn on the jury, completing the twelve jurymen, and one, Augustin
Vézina, does not appear to have been called the second time.

I see no reason to doubt that the permission to cause the
jurors to stand by the second lime was unauthorized. The right of the crown to
postpone the assignment of cause for challenging jurors until the panel had
been gone through, which has been discussed and explained in several cases the
explanations given by judges of eminence not always entirely agreeing, is
recognised by section 164 of our Criminal Procedure Act and is preserved
notwithstanding the new right of four peremptory challenges which is created by
the statute represented in that section, and is of course beyond question. But
when the panel has been gone through and the power to cause a juror to stand
aside in place of showing cause for challenging him is asserted a second time
what is done is not easily distinguishable in its effect from a peremptory
challenge, and is not warranted by the authority of any English decision or
(beyond the number of four) by section 164. The first four of the eleven might,
perhaps, be held in this view to have been properly excluded from the jury as
being peremptorily challenged, but the other seven should not have been set
aside except for cause.

The only English authority cited to the contrary is a dictum
of Bramwell B.in the important case of Mansell v. The Queen ([77]) where he
expresses the opinion that the judge might, after the panel had been perused, i
in his discretioVn for sufficient cause further postpone the time of assigning
cause, either for the crown or the prisoner, but

[Page 461]

not as a matter of right on a mere request without sufficient cause."" Mansell's case did not require a
decision of the point. The contest there arose on the facts which are set out
in the return to the writ of error ([78])
that a juror who had been called a second time after the panel had been gone
through, with the exception of twelve jurymen who were out of court considering
another case, was again required on the part of the crown to stand by, and the
twelve men just then returning into court, what was asked and allowed was that
the crown should not be put to assign cause for the challenge until after those
twelve men had been called. Bramwell B. further explains his opinion, saying:

I think therefore that even if the twelve whose names had not
been called over had not come into court when they did, it might have been right
to set aside Iremonger for a longer time, as long as there was reasonable
ground for thinking that any one might be brought into court who was liable to
serve and had not yet been objected to. The true rule is to postpone the time
for assigning cause till all reasonable endeavors to nuke all answer who ought
to answer have been exhausted. Then if twelve jurors have not been obtained the
crown must show cause but not till then.

There is no suggestion that in this case the attend anee of
the three defaulting jurymen could by any reasonable effort have been obtained
and under the rule laid down by Bramwell B. applied to the facts that we have
before us the crown could not in my judgment, object again to any one of the
fourteen men who were set aside on the first perusal of the panel except by way
of challenge for cause, though there was of course the limited peremptory
challenge allowed by section 164. The prisoner was deprived of a legal right in
respect of the constitution of the tribunal by which he was to be tried, and I
agree with the opinions that have been expressed that the matter is proper to 

[Page 462]

appear on the record. It would therefore be examinable in
error unless that proceeding is excluded by the 266th section of the act

At the same time I have no idea that under the cir constancies
the prisoner suffered any actual prejudice or that his trial was not fair and
impartial, having regard to the fact that he could have challenged peremptorily
every one of the seven jurors who were, in my opinion, improperly ordered to
stand by.

I think the court below was correct in holding that the case
came within the 266th section and in, therefore, quashing the writ of error.'

One essential to the allowance of the writ is that the
question of law could not have been reserved under section 259 which authorises
the reservation of any question of law which arises on the trial. It is
contended that the objection to the right of challenge having been taken before
the prisoner was given in charge to the jury the question arose before the
trial and not on the trial. This construction which confines the term ""i
trial l to the trial of the issues by the jury, in which sense the word may
be, no doubt, and often is properly used, seems too narrow to give full effect
to the intention of the section. In my opinion ""the trial,"" within
the meaning of the section, embraces all the proceedings before the judge who
is called in section 266 the judge presiding at the trial, whether those
proceedings are as in the present case, preliminary to the investigation by the
jury; or, as in the instance of a prisoner pleading guilty, result in a
conviction without the intervention of a jury* or relate to the evidence or the
directions or ruling of the judge; or to the reception or recording of the
verdict; or arise after the conviction, as for example, with regard to the
appropriateness of the sentence or to the punishment assigned by law to the
offence; and whether any such

questions are actually mooted while the trial is in progress
or have not suggested themselves until the trial is over, the prisoner
convicted, and sentence passed, upon him.

These views are, as I gather from reported cases, those
generally acted upon in England under the statute 11 & 12 Vic ch. 78 sec. 1
which is followed by our section 259.

I am not aware of any direct English decision upon the
immediate point as to when the trial commences. within the meaning of the act
but that is because it was never really in dispute.

My brother Taschereau has cited a number of cases bearing on
the point which I do not think it necessary to refer to again.

In Reg. v. Faderman ([79]) the point
was raised in argument shortly after the passing of the English act ([80]).

Parke B. said: ""
Properly there is no trial till issue is
joined;"" and Cresswell J. asked a question which received an affirmative answer in later cases :"" Is a prisoner tried
who pleads guilty ?'' The decision did not touch the question, being
that the Court of Crown Cases Reserved had not jurisdiction to review the
decision which was on demurrer because there had been no conviction. It may be
noticed, however, that whatever opinion nay have been implied by the
observation of Parke B., and whether or not the impression he
had at the moment of the signification of the word "" trial l would have
given the proper force to the expression as used in the statute, his dictum
does not reach the present case because the joinder of issue takes place before
the jury is called In the 8th edition of Trials per Pais, which bears the date
of 1176 there is this passage at p. 595, which deals with the joining of issue
:

[Page 464]

When the defendant bath pleaded to the indictment "" not
guilty,"" the clerk on behalf of the king or attorney general, by way of
replication says “culprit” i.e. culprist, which is an averment of his guilt, and a taking of issue thereupon, as much as
paratus est ue rificare quod
culpabilis est; the like as in
civil actions et hoc paratus verificare, prist in French signifying
the same with paratus in Latin; then the prisoner being demanded how he
will be tried, answers: ""By God and the country,"" which is the same
with a rejoinder and joining issue in a civil action concluding et de hoc ponit se super patriam. So
that upon all arraignments there is a formality of pleading observed, in effect
the same as in civil actions.

A year earlier than Faderman's case
Rolfe B. had in Reg. v. Martin ([81])
laid down a principle which has prevailed in most, if not in all, subsequent
cases. He said :——

I think that the word ""trial"" in the 2nd section of
11 & 12 Vic. c. 78 ought to have a very liberal construction, and I think
it applies to any proceeding in the court below.

The question whether the matter of law for the time in debate
arose at the trial has been discussed in several cases, but the objection has
usually been that the question was not raised until the trial was over. That
was so in Reg. v. Mellor ([82]),
in 1858, where the complaint related to the constitution of the jury,
but the fact that one juryman had been sworn in place of another was not
discovered till after the trial. The jurisdiction of the court for Crown Cases
Reserved was discussed on other grounds with considerable divergence of opinion
among the fourteen judges who composed the court. On the point as to the
question having arisen at the trial there was not much difference. No one
suggested that the empanelling of the jury was before the trial. Wiliiams J.
thought that the point as it came before the court, must be regarded as a point
occurring after verdict and therefore not a question of law which had arisen at
the trial within

[Page 465]

the meaning of the first section of the statute. That opinion,
which is discredited by later cases and notably by one decided as late
as last year which I shall notice presently, does not appear to have been
entertained by any other of the judges, while decided opinions to the contrary
were expressed. Lord Campbell C. J. thus dealt with the question:—

Although the question was not discussed, the facts upon which
it arises had occurred during the trial, and the judge while still acting under
the commission, respited the execution of the sentence and reserved the
question for the opinion of this court. It therefore seems to me to be a
question of law which arose on the trial. The salutary operation of the statute
would be greatly impaired if it were confined to questions of law which had
been openly discussed during the trial. Since the statute passed, judges have
usefully reserved under it questions as to the admissibility of evidence which
had not been discussed during the trial; and if the question might have been
discussed before the sentence was pronounced, I think the judge, acting under
the commission, has authority to reserve it, and to respite the execution of
the sentence.

Coleridge J. said :

We are bound to give this Act of Parliament a liberal
construction; and I think that when the subject matter of dispute or question
is connected with, or took place at the trial, whether it is considered at that
time or at a later period, it must be said in point of law to have

Wightman J., by whom the case had been reserved, and who was
speaking rather of the merits of the objection than of the question of
jurisdiction, remarked:

It may be that if the mistake had been discovered before the
verdict I might have discharged the juror with respect to whom the objection
had arisen, and called another juror, and then have heard the witnesses over
again, or I might have given the prisoner the liberty of challenging the juror,
with the consent of the counsel for the prosecution. The mistake however was
not discovered until after the verdict. It appears to me, therefore, that this
was a case of mistrial, and that if the privilege of challenge be of any value
at all it might be utterly defeated if this objection is not allowed to
prevail.

And Martin B. said :

[Page 466]

I have always understood that this Act of Parliament was
passed for the purpose of amending one of the greatest scandals of the law,
that whilst, in civil cases, the most trivial objection entitled the parties as
of right to a new trial, a prisoner whose life, as in this case, depends . on
the result, was prevented from getting his case reviewed, as to any error of
fact, without he adopted a most circuitous and expensive course. I agree that
we ought to give the most liberal construction. to this Act of Parliament, for
the purpose of giving to a prisoner an opportunity of asserting
every right which he legally possesses.

In Reg. v. Martin ([83]) decided in
1872, we have a decision upon a case stated on the application of counsel for
the prisoner after verdict and sentence.

In Reg. v. Brown ([84]), in 1889,
before Lord Coleridge C.J., the prisoner pleaded guilty and was sentenced.
After the Lord Chief Justice had left the assize town he was informed of a
decision which created in his mind a doubt as to the offence coming
within the statute under which the prisoner was charged, and he therefore
stated the case which was considered by the court. The case of Reg. v. Clark
([85])
was referred to with disapproval as a decision that a case cannot be reserved
after a plea of guilty. That had been so held in Reg. v. Clark, on
the ground that the question did not arise at the trial, not, however, from any
suggestion that the arraignment and the plea did not take place at the trial
but because the court considered that the prisoner having pleaded guilty
without taking any objection to the legal sufficiency of the charge, it could
not be said that the question whether the act charged was an offence within a
certain statute, on which question the judge asked the opinion of the court,
was a question arising on the trial. I shall read the concluding remarks of
Cockburn C. J from the Jurist where the language is given more fully than in
the regular report:

[Page 467]

But inasmuch as the power
to state case only applies where a question arises on the trial we have
no jurisdiction. The prisoner having pleaded guilty, no question arose on the
trial. A man who pleads guilty must be taken to know the law.

Thus the decision in Reg. Clark, whether sound or
unsound, is foreign to the present discussion.

The question reserved and disposed of in Beg. v.
Yeadon ([86])
was respecting the verdict.

Among the cases in which the question reserved related to the
sentence it will be sufficient to note Reg.v.
Summers ([87]),
in which case the sentence was held to be correct * Reg. v.
Willis ([88])
in 1872 where the sentence was amended by reducing the term of imprisonment
from seven years to five; Beg. v. Denne([89]), in 1877, in
which the sentence was left undisturbed * and Reg. v. Horn
([90])
in 1883 where the court amended the sentence.

In Ontario the courts have acted on the principle which I have
quoted from the language of Lord Cran worth when Baron Rolfe.

In Beg. v. Patteson ([91]) the question
reserved was respecting the right of the crown to cause jurors to stand aside
at the trial of an indictment for libel and the conviction was annulled
on the ground that the right accorded to the crown at the trial was not well
founded.

In Beg. v. Smith ([92]) there was an
objection to the constitution of the jury. The judge reserved the question at
the request of the prisoner after the close of the assize. It was held
to be properly reserved.

In Beg. v. Kerr ([93]) a question
was reserved and decided, touching the right to have a special jury.

[Page 468]

I am not sufficiently familiar
with the jurisprudence of the other provinces to venture to say what its course
has been in this matter, but if the jurisprudence of Quebec is correctly stated
by Mr. Justice Ramsay in Reg. v. Feote ([94]) as I assume
it to be, it is to give the
fullest possible scope to the provisions of section 259.

No question was reserved in
this case, and it must, I think be
held as was held in the court below, that the mere fact that the judge did not
reserve a case, is not tantamount to his refusing to reserve one. The refusal
must be in answer to a request. The legislature would doubtless have used
language of more direct force, or have employed some such term as
""fail,"" or ""omit,"" or "" neglect,"" if it was
intended that a writ of error should always be allowable whenever no case was
reserved.

These are the grounds on which
I am of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be affirmed. I
believe my views are substantially the same as those expressed by my brother
Strong on one branch of the case of Brisbois v. The Queen ([95]) which was argued shortly before I became a member of the
court, and held also in that case by my brother Fournier.

Those views were not concurred
in by the other members of the court who considered that the circum stance that
the objection to the constitution of the jury which was the subject of the case
reserved, was not suggested until after the conviction took it out of the statute
as a question of law arising on the trial. That opinion does not directly meet
the present case, in which the point taken is that the objection arose before
the trial and not on the trial. But the decision in Brisbois' case did
not rest on the one ground that the question had not arisen on the trial. It
proceeded also upon another ground, which was, by itself, quite sufficient

[Page 469]

to sustain the judgment of the court, namely, that the jurisdiction
was excluded by section 246 of the act. The point was thus concisely put by my
brother Taschereau :

This section, in express terms, enacts that judgment shall not
be stayed or reversed because any person has served upon the jury who was not
returned as a juror by the sheriff. Now here, the only irregularity complained
of is that Moise Lamoureux has served upon the jury, though not returned as a
juror by the sheriff.

It is plain, to my mind,that my opinion in this case is not in
conflict with the judgment of the court in Brisbois' case. Other grounds which
distinguish that case from the present have now been noticed by my
brothers Taschereau and Gwynne.

Reverting to Mellor's case, it may be worth noting that of the
fourteen judges seven held that the statute authorised the reservation of the
case and that there had been a mistrial. The other seven were not un animous on the question whether upon the facts of that case,
which differed materially from those now before us, there had been a
mistrial but they all agreed that the court had not jurisdiction to entertain
the case. I have already referred to the position taken by Williams J, The
other six based their opinion on a different line of argument, the strong point
of which was that the statute while it authorised the court to reverse confirm
or amend the judgment. gave no power to order a new trial or a venire de
novo. The argument is elaborated in the judgments of Pollock C. B. Erle J.
and Channel B.; Crompton J. expressed his concurrence and Crowder and Willis
JJ., who had doubts on the subject, inclined to the same view. The answer given
to this argument by Coleridge J. seems to have been that the court could
declare the trial a nullity and that without any formal award of a new trial
the prisoner must necessarily be tried again. Other judges considered

[Page 470]

that the power given by the statute to "" make such other
order as justice may require authorised the order for a new trial. Our
legislation leaves no room for the question. The act of 1869 ([96]), provided in
section 80, while repealing some provincial enactments which had authorised
new trials, and declaring that no writ of error should be allowed in any
criminal case unless founded on some question of law which could not have been
reserved or which the judge presiding at the trial refused to reserve for the
consideration of the court having jurisdiction in such cases, that nothing in
that section should be construed to pre vent the subsequent trial of the
offender for the same offence in any case where the conviction should be
declared bad for any cause which made the former trial a nullity so that there
was no lawful trial in the case. This provision took a somewhat more distinct
form in section 268 of the Criminal Procedure Act ([97]), which
declared that :

A new trial shall not be granted in any criminal case unless
the conviction is declared bad for a cause which makes the
former trial a nullity so that there was no lawful trial in the case.

This enactment retains the same form in the act of
50511 Vic. ch. 50 which amends section 268.

It may be safely assumed that if there had been legislation of
this character in England in 1858, the opinions of the Chief Baron and the
judges who took his view of the venire de novo question
would have coincided with that of the seven judges who held that the
statute covered the case. Indeed that opinion was very soon recognised as the
undisputed rule of construction to be applied to the statute as we find from Reg.
v. Yeadon ([98])
in which case a venire de novo was

[Page 471]

ordered in 1861, by a court composed of five judges, all of
whom had taken part in Mellor's case Pollock C.B. delivering the judgment of
the court, and the other judges, including Channel B. and Williams J.
concurring.

The language of our section 259 being the same which,
as found in the English Act, had received this definite construction, it would
be proper to hold if necessary to resort to that principle, that our parliament
had adopted the language in view of the construction it had received.

I am of opinion that we should dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed without
costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW
BRUNSWICK.

Criminal law—Assault on constable in
discharge of duty—Serving summons—Trial of indictment—Witness—Competency of
wife of defendant—R. S. C., ch. 162,
sec. 34—R. S. C., ch. 174, sec.
216.

An assault on a constable attempting to serve
a summons issued by a magistrate on information charging violation of the
Canada Temperance Act is an assault on a peace officer in the due execution of
his duty and indictable under R. S. C., ch. 162, sec. 34.

On the trial of an indictment for such
assault the wife of the defendant is not a competent witness on his behalf.

Appeal from a decision of the Court of Crown
Cases Reserved for the Province of New Brunswick, affirming the conviction of
the appellant on an indictment for assaulting a constable in discharge of his
duty.

The constable was entrusted with the service
of a summons against the appellant for violation of the Canada Temperance Act.
Not finding him at his place of business he went to the appellant's house and
met him coming out. It was after dark, and the constable asked appellant to
return to the house for a light to enable him to pick out the summons from
among others, which appellant refused to do, and walked away from the house.
The constable followed, and after proceeding some distance appellant threatened
to split his head open with a stick which he carried. After making this threat
he knocked the constable down, and his wife, who was with him, kicked the
constable as he lay on the ground. A person who had accompanied the constable
came to his assistance, and

[Page 394]

having procured a
light the summons was served. Appellant was indicted for the assault, and
convicted. The following questions were reserved for the consideration of the
Court of Crown Cases Reserved:

1. Was the service of a duplicate summons a
proper service under the Act?

2. Were the appellant and his wife competent
witnesses for the defence on the trial of the indictment?

3. Was the constable acting in the discharge
of his duty when the assault was committed?

The first question was abandoned at the
argument.

The Court of Crown Cases Reserved affirmed the conviction, Palmer J.
dissenting, and from their decision the present appeal was brought to the
Supreme Court of Canada.

J. A. Vanwart for
the appellant.

R. J. Ritchie,
Solicitor-General of New Brunswick, for the respondent.

The judgment of the court was delivered by

STRONG J.—I am of opinion that the defendant was properly
convicted and that this appeal must fail.

The first point was
virtually abandoned on the argument, and very properly so, for there cannot be
any doubt that the service of a summons is properly effected by delivering a
duplicate or copy to the defendant.

That the constable
Jones was in the execution of his duty as a constable or peace officer when he
was assaulted by the defendant whom he was endeavouring at the time to serve
with the summons must, I think, necessarily result from the provision of the
statute, which says that the service may be by a constable or peace officer,
inasmuch as by the 14th section of the statute, it was made the imperative duty
of the constable to serve a summons delivered to him by the magistrate. Then
Jones was endeavouring

[Page 395]

to serve the summons
when he was assaulted by the defendant, and therefore he was assaulted when in
the course of the execution of his duty. That this duty being one imposed by
statute, and not a common law duty of a peace officer, can make no difference
as regards the applicability of the statutory provision creating the special
offence for which the defendant was indicted, inasmuch as the duty to serve the
summons was imposed upon the prosecutor ex officio in his character as a
constable or peace officer.

The only remaining
question is whether the evidence of Jones and his wife, tendered at the trial
on behalf of the defendant, was properly rejected, and I am of opinion that
upon this point also the ruling of the learned Chief Justice was entirely
right. Such evidence under the statute is only admissible where the defendant
is charged with simple assault and battery, which must be taken to mean the old
common law misdemeanor answering to that description. The defendant was not
indicted for this offence, but for the statutory offence of assaulting a peace
officer in the execution of his duty. Upon this point the case of Reg.
v. Richardson[1]
is direct authority against the appeal, and I see no answer to it.

In my opinion, there
does not exist any reason for doubting that the ruling of the Chief Justice at
the trial, and the judgment of the Supreme Court in banc, were correct.

The appeal must be
dismissed.

Appeal dismissed and conviction affirmed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
CROWN CASES RESERVED FOR THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Criminal law—Indictment—Name of third person—Alias dictus—Proof of names—Variance.

Where two or more names are laid in an indictment under an alias
dictus it is not necessary to prove them all.

J. was indicted for the murder of A. J. otherwise called K. K.
On the trial it was proved that the deceased was known by the name of K. K. but
there was no evidence that she ever went by the other name.

Held, affirming the judgment of the court below, that
this variance between the indictment and the evidence did not invalidate the
conviction of J. for manslaughter.

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Crown Cases Reserved
for the Province of Quebec affirming the conviction of the appellant for
manslaughter.

The appellant, an Indian, was indicted under the name of Angus
Jacobs, otherwise called Skahatati, for the homicide of one Agnes Jacobs
otherwise called Kalwakeri Karonhienhawitha. At the trial the deceased was
identified as an Indian woman known by the Indian name laid in the indictment,
but there was no evidence that she was ever called by the name of Agnes Jacobs.
The appellant was convicted of manslaughter, and his counsel having urged that
he was entitled to an acquittal by reason of the variance between the evidence
and the indictment, the trial judge reserved the following case for the

[Page 434]

consideration of the Court of Crown
Cases Reserved:—

“Aux séances de la cour du Bane de la Reine, terme du mois de
septembre dernier, pour affaires criminelles, Angus Jacobs, autrement appelé
Skahatati a subi son procès sur accusation de meurtre pour avoir tué Agnés
Jacobs, autrement appelée Kaowakeri Karonhienhawitha.

""Joseph Jones, coroner, pour le district de Montréal a été
le premier témoin produit, et a prouvè a l'en-quéte qu'il avait -tenu sur le
corps de la victime qui y est designée dans le verdict ou rapport du jury sous
le nom de Agnés Jacob, autrement appelée Kaowakeri Karonhienhawiiha. Le second
et le principal témoin Karonhenawi a déposé qu'elle avait connu
Kaowakeri Karonhienhawitba, sa sæur et la défunte femme de l'ac-cusé, et
qu'elle était présente lors de l'assaut qui a été la cause de sa mort.

“Les autres témoins n'ont pas donné le nom de la victime. Ils
l'ont seulement désignée comme étant en son vivant. la femme de l'accusé.

“L'accusé et sa femme étaient des Indiens demeurant a
Caughnawaga. Le témoin Agathe Karonhienawi et plusieurs autres témoins
appartenaient aussi à des tribus indiennes et ne parlaient que le langage de
leur tribu. Leur témoignage a été traduit aux jurés par un interprête.

“Après que la couronne eut clos son enquête l'accusé procéda à
la sienne et fit entendre plusieurs témoins.

“Avant d'adresser la parole au jury en faveur de son client,
l'avocat de l'accusé attira l'attention de la cour sur ce que l'acte
d'accusation portait que la défunte s'appelait Agnes Jacob, autrement appelée
Kaowakeri Karonhienhawitha, et que la preuve faisait voir qu'elle s'appelait
Marguerite Monique; au soutien de cette prétention il a rédér a un prétendu
certificat de baptéme, qui n'a pas été prouvé dans la cause.

[Page 435]

""Le jury a trouvé la prisonnier coupable de Man-slaughter
par un verdict qu'il a rapporté le 20 septembre dernier (1888).

“Comme il n'a été fait aucune preuve que la victime des coups
infligés par l'accusé s'appelait Marguerite Monique, l'objection faite par le
conseil de l'accusé n'était pas fondée. D'un autre côté il n'a pas été prouvé
lors du procés, si ce n'est par la production du rapport du jury sur l'enquéte
faite devant le coroner, que la femme de l'accusé s'appelait Agnès Jacob, ni
qu'elle fut connue sous ce nom et comme la variante entre la description donnée
dans l'acte d'accusation de la personne qui a été tuéé et la preuve qui a été
faite du nom de cette personne, m'a parue de quelqu'importance, j'ai cru devoir
réserver pour la considération de la cour des cas réservés de la Couronne, la
question suivante: 

“Le prisonnier Angus Jacob, ayant été accueé d'avoir tué Agnés
Jacob, autrernent appelée Kaowakeri Karonhienhawitha, la preuve qui a été
faite, tel que ci-dessus rapporté était-elle suffisante quant à la description
de la victime de l'accusé, pour justifier le verdict de Man-slaughler rapporté
par le jury.

""Si la cour est d'opinion que la preuve sur ce point est
suffisante le verdict devra etre maintenu.

""Si au contraire la Cour est d'opinion qu'il y a une
variante fatale entre le nom sous lequel la personne qui a été tuée est désigné
dans l'acte d'indictement et la preuve qui en a été faite, le verdict devra être
annulé.

“Montréal, 8 novembre, 1888,

[Page 436]

The Court of Crown Cases Reserved held the evidence sufficient
and affirmed the conviction. The prisoner then appealed to the Supreme Court of
Canada.

Cornellier Q.C. for appellant and Trenholme for
the respondent.

STRONG J.—The
prisoner, Angus Jacobs otherwise called Skahatati—an Iroquois Indian of the
Caugnawaga tribe—was indicted for the murder of his wife, who was described in
the indictment as Agnes Jacobs otherwise called Kaowakeri Karonhienhawitha. The
prisoner having been found guilty of manslaughter the learned Chief Justice of
the Court of Queen's Bench before whom the trial took place reserved this case
for the opinion of the Court in banc pursuant to the Statute ([1]).

The Court of Queen's Bench (Mr. Justice Doherty dissenting)
held that the prisoner was properly convicted.

It was not proved that the deceased was known by the name of
Marguerite Monique; the objection on that score was therefore properly
overruled — and indeed the point reserved by the case does not include any
question on that head. The allegation of the name of the deceased in the indictment
under an alias was clearly good pleading inasmuch as the names of third persons
as well as those of prisoners may be thus laid. In Mr. Justice Stephen's work
on Criminal Procedure ([2])
the rule of pleading is thus stated ""The indictment"" must state the
Christian name or names and the ""surname of the Defendant and the person
against"" whom the offence was committed. If they have gone "" by or
acknowledged more names than one they may "" be described as J. S.
otherwise called J. T.

[Page 437]

The deceased being thus properly described in the indictment
as "" Agnes Jacobs alias Kaowakeri Karonhienhawitha the proof to support
the indictment must of course be secundum allegatum.

Then it is proved by the sister of the deceased that the
latter was known by the Indian name in which under an alias she was described
in the indictment, but there is no proof that she was ever known as or called
Agnes Jacobs. The sole question is, therefore, whether this proof supports the
indictment. On the one hand it is said that when a party is described under an
alias it must in order to support the indictment, be
proved that he is known by both names, being called sometimes by the one and
sometimes by the other. On the other hand it is contended for the crown that
when the name of a person mentioned in an indictment is laid in this way it is
sufficient to shew that he was known by one of the names stated though there
may be no proof whatever of his having been called by the other.

I am of opinion that the latter is the correct conclusion The
literal terms of the allegation in the indictment o otherwise called "" are
covered by such proof Which in the case of a prisoner described under an alias
has always been held sufficient. I can see no reason why any distinction should
be made in this respect between the instance of a prisoner and that of a third
person described in this alternative manner In the one as well as the other it
is a literal proof of an averment that his name was A otherwise B, to prove
that he was called by the name B and by no other name. I find no English case
upon the point for the reason probably that the practice was too plain ever to
have given rise to doubt. In Dr. Wharton's work on Criminal Evidence ([3]), there is the
following passage

[Page 438]

When the name either of the defendant or a third party is laid
with an alias dictus proof of either name will be enough,

I also find, in the treatise on Criminal Procedure ([4]) by the same
learned writer the following passage containing a reference to the same point
speaking however of the defendant's name.

The surname may be such as the defendant has usually gone by
or acknowledged: and if there be a doubt which one of the two names is the real
surname the second may be added in the indictment after an alias dictus thus
"" Richard Wilson
otherwise called Richard Layer."" Proof of either will
be enough

I am of opinion that the decision of the Court of Crown Cases
Reserved holding the prisoner properly convicted was entirely right and that
this appeal from it should be dismissed with costs

FOURNIER and TASCHEREAU JJ. concurred.

GWYNNE J.—The appellant, an Indian, was indicted under the
name of Angus Jacobs otherwise called Skahatati for the homicide of one Agnes
Jacobs otherwise called Kaowakeri Karonhienhawilha, and
pleaded not guilty. At the trial evidence was given identifying the deceased as
an Indian woman by the Indian name given to her in the indictment, but no
evidence was offered to .how that she was known by the name of Agnes Jacobs.
There does not appear to have been any evidence that she had acquired by
marriage or otherwise the name of Jacobs or that she
was known by that name, or in fact by any other than her Indian name as above
stated. It was objected at the trial upon the part of the now appellant that he
could not be convicted of the offence charged in the indictment for want of
evidence to shew that the deceased was known by the name of Agnes Jacobs. The
objection was overruled and the prisoner was found guilty, by the jury,

[Page 439]

of manslaughter. In view of the above objection the learned
judge who tried, the case, reserved, for the consideration of the Court of
Crown Cases Reserved in the Province of Quebec where the trial took place, the
question whether proof only that the deceased was known by the Indian name
given her in the indictment, was sufficient to justify the conviction.

The Court of Crown Cases Reserved for the Province of Quebec
decided that it was and from that judgment this appeal is taken.

I am of the opinion that proof of the deceased's Indian name
as given was sufficient. In fact, as far as appears, this was her only true
name, or that by which she was known. The description as stated in the
indictment was just the same as if the Indian name had been stated first,
followed by ""otherwise called Agnes Jacobs,"" in which case, on the
Indian name being proved the identification would surely be sufficient. No case
has been cited in support of the contention that where two or more names are
laid under an alias dictus all must be proved. Such a contention is at
variance with the use of the form alias dictus the object of which is to
enable proof of one or other of the names to be sufficient. The contention that
the appellant, if again indicted for the homicide of this same person described
by a different name, would be unable to plead his conviction in the present
case, has no foundation in point of fact, for in the event of such a
contingency, remote if possible, occurring, there would be no difficulty
whatever in pleading that the person in such an indictment, charged to have
been killed, was an Indian woman, known by the name of Kaowakeri Karonhienhawîtha
of the homicide of whom the accused was convicted on the indictment in
the present case This case appears to be quite distinguishable from the case of

[Page 440]

Reg. v. Frost ([5])
in which proof of some only of the christian names as laid in the indictment of
a person necessary to be identified was held to be insufficient, it having been
proved that the person had other christian names than those proved. Here the
whole of the deceased's Indian name has been proved, and so far as appears she
had no other name, so that there can not be said to be any uncertainty as to
the person for whose homicide the appellant has been convicted.

The appeal must be dismissed.

PATTERSON J,—The
prisoner was indicted for the murder of ""Agnes Jacobs, otherwise called
Kaowakeri karonhienhawitha,"" and was convicted of man-slaughter and
sentenced, the Chief Justice, Sir A. A. Dorion, reserving for the opinion of
the Court of Queen's Bench the question whether sufficient evidence was given
of the description of the person alleged to have been murdered to justify the
verdict of manslaughter.

The Court of Queen's Bench held the evidence sufficient, Mr.
Justice Doherty dissenting, and the prisoner has appealed to this court.

The facts stated by the learned Chief Justice are that Angus
Jacobs was tried for the murder of ""Agnes Jacobs otherwise called
Kaowakeri Karonhienhawitha:"" That the coroner proved the inquest on the
body of the victim who is described in the verdict or return of the jury under
the name of Agnes Jacob otherwise called Kaowakei Karonhienhawîtha:
That the second and the principal witness, Karonhienawi deposed that she knew
Kaowakeri Karonhienhawîtha, her sister and the deceased
wife of the prisoner, and that she was present at the assault which caused her
death: That the other witnesses did not give the 

[Page 441]

name of the deceased, only describing her as being, when
alive, the wife of the accused: That the accused and his wife were Indians,
living at Caughnawaga: That the witness, Agathe Karonhienawi
and several other witnesses belonged also to Indian tribes and spoke only the
language of their tribe, their evidence being given to the jury by means of an
interpreter: That after the close of the evidence for the Crown, the accused
called several witnesses on his own behalf: That before addressing the jury for
his client, the prisoner's counsel called the attention of the court to the
fact that the indictment purported that the deceased was called Agnes Jacob
otherwise called Kaowakeri Karonhienhawîtha, and that the
evidence was that she was called Marguerite Monique, in
support of which proposition he referred to a pretended certificate of baptism
which was not proved in the cause: That the jury found the prisoner guilty of
manslaughter by a verdict returned on the 20th of September, 1888: That as
there was no proof that the victim of the blows inflicted by the accused was
called Marguerite Monique, there was no foundation for the
objection of his counsel: That on the other hand it was not proved during the
proceedings, unless it was by the return of the jury at the coroner's inquest,
that the prisoner's wife was called Agnes Jacob, nor that she was known by that
name; and that as the variance between the description given in the indictment
of the person killed and the proof of the name of that person seemed to him,
the Chief Justice, of some importance, he thought it right to reserve for the
consideration of the Court of Crown Cases Reserved the question which I have
mentioned.

If the court should be of opinion that the proof on the point
was sufficient the verdict was to stand.

On the contrary, if the court should think there was

[Page 442]

a fatal variance between the name by which, the person killed
was described in the indictment and the proof which had been given, the verdict
was to be annulled.

The term ""variance"" is hardly appropriate. There is
no variance. The proof in no way differs from the description in the indictment.
As far as it goes, it agrees with that description. The question is, does it go
far enough?

The evidence is direct that the woman killed by the prisoner
was Kaowakeri Karonhienhawitha. It is also directly proved that she was the
wife of the convict, whence it follows that her name was Jacobs. Thus the whole
description is covered with the exception of the christian name Agnes. lt does
not appear that Agnes was not her name. If that had been shown there would have
been more reason to talk of a variance. Counsel who took the objection would
seem, as I gather from the learned Chief Justice's note, to
have been alive to the difference between proving a different name from that
given in the indictment and failing to prove what the name was, for he based his
objection on the name of Marguerite Monique. The objection
in that form was not improperly urged as a variance, but it failed for want of
proof that Marguerite Monique was the name of the
deceased.

I have given as full an examination as has been in my power to
the question whether the verdict would have been justified if the evidence had
gone no further than to prove that the woman killed by the prisoner was called
Kaowakeri Karonhienhawitha, and I have not been able to find authority for
holding that it would not be justified. The question is one of identity, and it
has been properly so treated by Mr. Cornellier in his able and ingenious
argument on behalf of the prisoner.

[Page 443]

The rule, Which
is well settled as illustrated by décisions many
of which were cited to us, and which is usually enforced
with strictness, requires the name, whether of the accused or of a third party,
to be proved as laid in the indictment, and the mitigation of the harshness
incident, to the operation of the rule, by the extension of the power of
amendment, rather affirms than discredits the rule. But the necessity of
proving more than one name when alternative names are laid with an alias
dictus, is a different thing. I was a good deal impressed by the argument
that the substantive description here was Agnes Jacobs, the Indian name being
secondary only, and that, whether the latter was proved or not, the identity
was not established without proof of the former; but I cannot find authority to
support that view with sufficient certainty to warrant an interference with the
judgment in appeal.

The deceased is not described in the indictment as the wife of
the prisoner. Had she been so described, the proof of identity afforded by this
evidence would have been complete, without proving that her name was Agnes. One
description would have been established sufficient to identify the person
described with the person killed, and no conflict of proof would have arisen
from the mere absence of evidence touching the alternative description.

It may be plausibly argued that that illustration is not quite
parallel to the description in hand, but I am unable satisfactorily to
distinguish them.

But the case is stronger than one where there is no evidence
to prove the alternative description. We have, as I have remarked, evidence
from the witnesses that the name of the deceased was Jacobs. It was proved
before the jury that she was the wife of the prisoner, who therefore knew her
real name and who called witnesses, and could by those or some other

[Page 444]

witness have shown, if the fact was so, that the person called
Kaowakeri karonhienhawîtha was not Agnes. Tee proof of the proceedings before
the coroner is to me a new feature in the ordinary evidence at a trial for
murder. Whatever was the object of the proof, the effect was that there was
before the court and jury a record touching the crime in question, though not
an adjudication in any sense binding on the prisoner. In it the deceased was
described by both names. That description may be conceded to have been evidence
of the faintest kind and of no weight against contradictory evidence adduced at
the trial; but the evidence, in place of contradicting, bore out, as far as it
went, the allegations of the return; the return itself was put m evidence,
without objection, as something relating to the same offence for which the
indictment was preferred; and no attempt was made on the part of the prisoner
to question, by evidence, the identity.

On the whole I am not prepared to say that a specific finding
that the deceased was the person called Agnes Jacobs would have been
unsupported by evidence.

In my opinion we should dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME
COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Procedure—Indictment
for rape—Conviction for assault with intent—Attempt—R. S. C. c. 174 s. 183—Punishment.

An assault with intent to
commit a felony is an attempt to commit such felony withén the meaning of sec.
183 of R. S. C. c. 174[1].

On an indictment for rape a
conviction for an assault with intent to commit rape is valid.

On such conviction the
prisoner was held properly sentenced to imprisonment under R. S. C. c. 162 s.
38[2].

APPEAL from a decision of the
Supreme Court British Columbia, affirming a conviction against the appellant
for an assault with intent to commit rape.

This is an appeal from the
judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia on a writ of error, a single

[Page 385]

question of law being involved,
namely, whether on an indictment charging that the prisoner ""violently and
feloniously did make an assault, and her, the said R., then violently and,
against her will, feloniously did ravish and carnally know against the form,
etc.,"" there could be a conviction of "" assault with intent to commit
rape."" On such conviction the appellant was sentenced to two years imprisonment.

The Supreme Court of British
Columbia affirmed the conviction by a divided court, the Chief Justice and Mr.
Justice Crease giving judgment for, and Gray and Walkem JJ. against it. The
prisoner then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.

Christopher Robinson Q.C. for the appellant referred to R. S. C. c. 162
ss. 34, 36, 38 ; c. 174 ss. 183, 191; c. 181 s. 24 Subs 2 ; and cited the
following authorities, Reg v. Thomas[3]
; Reg. v. Collins[4]
; Reg. v. Dungey[5]
; Reg. v. Smith[6].

Dr. McMichael Q.C. for the
respondent cited R. S. C. c. 162 ss. 8 to 13, and s, 38., Reg. v. Marsh[7]
; Reg. v. Watkins[8]
; Reg. v. Huxley[9]
; Bishop's Cr. Proc.[10].

The judgment of the court was
delivered by Mr. Justice Strong as follows—

STRONG J.—This is an appeal from
the decision of the Supreme Court of British Columbia upon a writ of error
brought by the present appellant Edwin John who, having been indicted and tried
for a rape on the person of one Mary Ann Radford, had been acquitted of the
felony but found guilty of the misdemeanor of having assaulted the prosecutrix
with intent to commit the offence charged. The verdict of the jury as

[Page 386]

rendered was in the following
terms : "" The prisoner is not guilty of the felony whereof he stands
indicted but is guilty of assault with intent to commit rape."" The
prisoner's counsel upon this verdict being returned contended that the jury
could not find such a verdict upon an indictment for the felony, that although
they might have convicted the prisoner of an attempt to commit the felony under
sec. 183 of R. S. C., ch. 174, yet a conviction of an assault with ""
intent "" to commit rape was not a conviction for an "" attempt ""
as warranted by that enactment. The Chief Justice of British Columbia, before
whom the prisoner was tried, refused to reserve the point under the statute and
sentenced the prisoner to two years' imprisonment. The prisoner then brought
his writ of error. The court on the argument of the writ of error being
composed of four judges was equally divided, the Chief Justice and Crease J.
being of opinion to affirm the conviction and Gray and Walkem JJ. being of
opinion that it ought to be quashed. In order to allow an appeal to this court
Mr. Justice Gray withdrew his judgment.

I am of opinion that the decision
appealed against was right and ought to be affirmed. It is, of course, beyond
question that at common law a proceeding such as this, a conviction for a
misdemeanor upon an indictment for felony, would be wholly unsustainable. Some
statute must, therefore, be invoked as sanctioning such a departure from the
ordinary course of the common law. The statute upon which the conviction is
rested is that already referred to "" The Criminal Procedure Act,"" R.
S. C., ch. 174 by the 183rd sec. of which it is enacted :—

If on the trial of any
person charged with any felony or misdemeanor it appears to the jury upon the
evidence that the defendant did not complete the offence charged, but that he
was guilty only of an attempt to commit the same, such person shall not by
reason thereof be entitled to be acquitted, but the jury shall be at liberty to
return as their verdict that the defendant is not guilty of the felony or
misdemeanor charged, but is guilty of an attempt to com-

[Page 387]

mit the same ; and thereupon
such person shall be liable to be punished in the same manner as if he had been
convicted upon an indictment for attempting to commit the particular felony or
misdemeanor charged in the indictment ; and no person tried as lastly mentioned
shall be liable to be afterwards prosecuted for committing or attempting to
commit the felony or misdemeanor for which he was so tried.

This, as it appears to me, is the
only enactment to which this conviction can be referred. Section 191 of the
same act (ch. 174)authorises the conviction of any person, indicted for a
felony which includes an assault against the person, of the assault alone
although the assault may not be charged in terms, the accused being acquitted
of the felony. This, however, means only a common assault and not an assault
such as that the jury have in terms found the prisoner guilty of here, viz.,
"" an assault with intent to commit rape."" The question is therefore
really reduced to this : Is an "" assault with intent to commit rape ""
an attempt to commit the felony charged within the meaning of section 183 ? I
am of opinion that primâ facie, and unless there is some other enactment
shewing a contrary intention and therefore calling for a narrower construction
of section 183, that it clearly is so. This opinion is founded on the
considerations that an indictment for the common law misdemeanor of an attempt
to commit a felony always alleged the particular overt act of which the attempt
consisted and, further, that inasmuch as an attempt to commit a crime is, as
Mr. Justice Stephens defines it[11] ""
an act done with intent to commit that crime and forming part of a series of
acts which would constitute its actual commission if it were not interrupted
"" (a definition which has the support of ample judicial authority as the
learned author shews in the illustrations appended to his text,) so the
converse holds good that an assault with intent to commit rape is an attempt to
commit that offence. I have not the slightest doubt, therefore, that if the

[Page 388]

present conviction depends on the
construction to be placed on section 183 alone that we ought to hold it good.

Then the other statutory
provisions material to be considered are the following. Section 24, sub-section
2 of Chap. 181 R. S. C. enacts that

Every one who is convicted on
indictment of any misdemeanor for which no punishment is specially provided
shall be liable to five years imprisonment.

And section 38 of chapter 162
enacts that

Every one who assaults any
woman or girl with intent to commit rape is guilty of a misdemeanor and liable
to Imprisonment for any term not exceeding seven years and not less than two
years.

This last provision, no doubt,
declares that an assault with intent to commit rape shall be a misdemeanor, but
this was already the law, for an assault with such intent was, as before shewn,
an attempt to commit the felony which was by itself always a common law
misdemeanor, in addition to which the mere assault, independently of the
aggravation, was also a common law misdemeanor. The only purpose and effect, therefore,
of this section 38 was, as it seems to me, to affix a new and precise
punishment to this particular species of the misdemeanor of attempting to
commit a felony, viz. imprisonment with a maximum limit of seven years and a
minimum limit of two years. Therefore nothing contained in this section 38 took
this particular species of offence out of the category of attempts to commit
felonies in which it was obviously before included at common law, so as to make
it a new statutory misdemeanor in which there could not be a conviction upon an
indictment for the felony ; on the contrary the whole object of the section
manifestly was to define the punishment for an offence which always constituted
a misdemeanor at common law, and for which the 183rd section of the Procedure
Act had provided there might be a conviction on an indictment for the felony.

[Page 389]

Then if this is so the 24th
section, sub-section 2, of the Punishments Act, chap. 181, can have no bearing
on the question of the validity of the conviction. As already shown it provides
for the punishment, by a lesser degree of imprisonment than is affixed to the
offence of an assault with intent to commit rape, of misdemeanors for which no
punishment is specially provided.

But a different punishment is specially
provided for the offence of an assault with intent to commit rape, and
according to section 183, if the case comes within that section, the punishment
so specially affixed is that which is to be awarded when a party is convicted
on an indictment for the distinct and substantive offence of attempting to
commit the felony. The question, therefore, really comes back to this: Is an
assault with intent an attempt within the meaning of section 183, of which a
party can be convicted on an indictment for rape ? And having regard to the
older authorities and precedents, to the definitions given by Mr. Justice
Stephens, and to what seems to me to be an incontrovertible proposition
requiring no demonstration that an assault with intent to commit rape is ex
necessitate an attempt to commit that offence, I must hold that sec. 38 of
ch. 162 and section 183 of the Procedure Act both apply and that the conviction
must be, therefore, affirmed.

Appeal dismissed with
costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA
SCOTIA.

Criminal law—Felony—Jury attending
church—Preacher's remarks—Influence on jury—Expert testimony—Admissibility.

In the course of a trial for murder by
shooting the jury attended church in charge of a constable and the clergyman
directly addressed them, referring to the case of a man hung for murder in P.
E. I., and urging them, if they had the slightest doubt of the guilt of the
prisoner they were trying, to temper justice with equity. The prisoner was
convicted.

Held,
affirming the judgment of the Court of Crown Cases reserved in Nova Scotia,
that although the remarks of the
clergyman were highly improper it could not be said that the jury were so
influenced by them as to affect their verdict.

A witness was called at the trial to give
evidence as a medical expert and in answer to the crown prosecutor he said,
""there are indicia in medical science from which it can be said at
what distance small shot were fired at the body. I have studied this—not
personal experience, but from books."" He was not cross-examined as to the
grounds of this statement and no medical witnesses were called by the prisoner
to confute it. The witness then stated the distance from the murdered man at
which the shot must have been fired in the case before the court, and on what
he based his opinion as to it giving the result of his examination of the body.

Held, Strong
J. and Fournier J. dissenting, that by his preliminary statement the witness
had established his capacity to speak as a medical expert, and it not having
been shown by cross-examination, or other testimony, that there were no such indicia
as stated, his evidence as to the distance at which the shot was fired was
properly received.

Appeal from a decision of the Court of Crown
Cases Reserved for the Province of Nova Scotia affirming the conviction of the
prisoners (appellants) for murder.

[Page 402]

The defendants, William Preeper and Jane
Doyle, were jointly indicted for the murder of one Peter Doyle, and two questions
were reserved under c. 174, s. 259 R. S. C. for the consideration of the
justices for crown cases reserved in the Province of Nova Scotia.

1 As to certain observations made by a
clergyman in his sermon in the presence and hearing of the jury.

The learned judge says—""It was my
instruction to the jury, and the officers in charge of them, that they should
not separate while out of court nor permit any person whatever to converse with
them on the subject of the trial. These instructions were repeated several
times during the course of the trial, and particularly on the adjournment] of
the court on the evening of Saturday the 7th day of April aforesaid.""

On the morning of Sunday, the 8th day of
April aforesaid, the whole twelve jurors attended service at a church known as
the Grafton Street Methodist Church in the City of Halifax, being accompanied
by, and in charge of, the deputy sheriff. What occurred while such jury was
present in such church is set out in the affidavit of Mr. F. H. Oxley, which is
as follows:—

The jury who tried the above cause attended
the said service, and the Reverend William Brown was the officiating clergyman
and preached a sermon on the said occasion.

The subject of the said sermon was the
parable of the ""Prodigal Son,"" and the principal argument of the
preacher was to point out the justice and certainty of punishment for wrong
doing.

The preacher also stated that all persons
were free agents and had the opportunity of choosing their course in life, and
if they did wrong the merited punishment would follow as a result of their own
act.

As an instance, illustrating his argument, he
referred

[Page 403]

to the case of
Millman, a prisoner then under sentence of death for murder in the Province of
Prince Edward Island.

He also stated that he observed in his
audience the men of the jury, who for several days had been separated from the
community considering the fate of the prisoners accused of the murder of Doyle,
and that although he realized it was not for him to instruct them in the matter
yet he felt it was his duty to remind them that unless they were clearly
satisfied of the guilt of the prisoners their judgment should be tempered with
equity.

The question whether the verdict can stand
after such an address made to the jury, tending as it does to interfere with
the administration of justice and from which inferences might be drawn by the
jury hostile to the prisoners, is one of the questions reserved by the trial
judge.

2. One Norman McKay, a doctor of medicine,
was produced as a witness on behalf of the crown and gave evidence establishing
his competency to speak as a medical expert but not as an expert in any other
particular. In his capacity of medical expert he gave evidence of the character
of the injuries, the organs involved, the cause of death, etc. The death of
deceased was caused by a charge of shot from a shot gun, which gun was found so
lying in relation to the body as to render it material to be known at the trial
what distance from the body of deceased the muzzle of the gun was at the moment
the fatal shot was discharged. In the course of Dr. McKay's direct examination
he was asked the following question by the counsel prosecuting for the crown:—

""From your knowledge of medical science
in this respect, and from your examination in this case, at how great or less a
distance would the muzzle of the

[Page 404]

gun be from a human
body at the time of the discharge?""

This question was at once objected to by
counsel for the prisoners but allowed by the judge. The answer given by the witness
was as follows:—

""Judging from what I saw, from the
nature of the wound, and its appearance, I would say that the muzzle of the gun
was not nearer than twenty inches, and not further away than three feet, when
it was discharged.""

The question of Dr. McKay's competency to be
asked and to answer the above question was also reserved.

A copy of the notes of the whole of the
testimony of said Dr. McKay given on said trial was appended to the reserved
case.

By these notes it appears that after stating
that he was a medical man of the Nova Scotia Medical Board, and a graduate of
the University of Halifax and Royal College of Surgeons, England, and had
conducted an autopsy on the body of Peter Doyle, after describing minutely the
examination he made and the wound and shot he found, and the probing of the
wound and the upward course pursued by the shot in the body, the witness
proceeds to state that—

""There are indicia in medical
science from which it can be said at what distance small shot were fired at the
body. I have studied this—not personal experience—but from medical works. I
examined the wound of deceased for the purpose of discerning this fact. Mr.
Weeks asks witness: ""From your knowledge of medical science in this
respect, and from your examination in this case, at how great or how less a
distance would the muzzle of the gun be from a human body at the time of the
discharge?""

Mr. Henry objects to this question and it was

[Page 405]

allowed subject to
the objection. The witness answered:—

""Judging from what I saw, from nature of
wound and appearance, I would say that the muzzle of the gun was not nearer
than twenty inches, and not further away than three feet, when it was
discharged. The carrying capacity of the gun, and the nature of the charge, and
the condition of the gun as regards cleanliness and the shape of the hole would
modify the distance as given by me. There are cases on record where the gun at
a much greater distance than I have described produced such a wound as I have
described. Death would be instantaneous from such a wound as I have described.
In my opinion it would be impossible for a man after receiving such a wound to
walk six feet, turn and sit down. If a man had been shot standing upright, and
I found him at a distance of six feet sitting down after such a wound as I have
described, I would expect to find blood all down his legs and pants and into
his shoes, and probably on the ground, if it were possible for a man to do
that, for with such a wound the heart would cease to beat instantly, after such
a wound.

Cross-examined: I never witnessed a case from
wound to the heart: I speak entirely from books and experience of other men: I
mean that a party shot in this way could not make a step in the sense of
walking: one reason I have for saying the gun was not nearer than twenty inches
was that I saw no traces of burning: when a man is clothed with shirt and under
shirt would not expect any burning at all: in giving my opinion as to distance
of muzzle I do so on assumption there was no clothing on: independently of
burning altogether I can say that it could not have been nearer than twenty
inches: I never saw in any work on the subject a statement of the number of

[Page 406]

inches which might
intervene between muzzle of gun and wound: in reference to burning I based my
opinion as to distance, not so much as to the absence of burning as from the
size of the wound and the jagged nature of the edge.

The Court of Crown Cases Reserved affirmed
the conviction, McDonald C.J. and Mr. Justice McDonald dissenting. The
prisoners then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.

Henry Q.C. and
Harrington Q.C. for the appellants. We will first deal with the question
of expert evidence reserved in the case. It is stated in the case and admitted
that this evidence is most material. There are two primary objections to the
evidence. First, that the subject upon which Doctor McKay was examined was not
in itself a subject of expert testimony, but was a matter of ordinary
knowledge.

2. If it were the witness has not given such
evidence as would show that he was skilled in the science to which it relates.

As to the first objection the following
authorities were referred to: Wharton on Crim. Ev.[1]; Carter v. Boehm[2]; Milwaukee
& St. Paul Ry. Co. v. Kellogg[3];
Campbell v. Rickards[4].

As to the first question reserved the learned
counsel cited Commonwealth v. Roby[5];
United States v. Gibert[6];
The King v. Wooler[7].

Longley, Atty.
Gren. of Nova Scotia, for the respondent referred on the question of expert
evidence to Rogers on Law and Medical Men[8];
Lawson on expert Evidence[9];
Roscoe on Crim. Ev.[10];
Taylor on Ev.[11];

[Page 407]

Archbold's Cr. Pl.[12]; McNaghten's Case[13];
Rex. v. Wright[14];
Collier v. Simpson[15];
Rowley v. London & North Western Ry Co.[16]; 1
Taylor's Med. Jur.[17]

On the first question reserved the learned
Attorney General cited The Queen v. Kennedy[18].

Henry Q. C. in
reply cited New England Glass Co. v. Lovell[19]; Kennedy
v. The People[20];
Taylor on Med. Jur.[21];
Rogers on Law and Medical Men[22];
Wharton & Stillé's Med. Jur.[23].

Sir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.—After stating the
points reserved and the substance of the judges' notes at the trial, his
lordship proceeded as follows:—

As to the first
point, that the observations of the clergyman caused a mis-trial, there can be
no doubt, I should think in the minds of all right thinking persons, that in
referring, in the presence of the jury, to the trial and the jury, the
clergyman entirely mistook his duty and laid himself open to the very grave
charge of interfering with the administration of justice. But though his
interference was most improper and unjustifiable, and worthy of the severest
censure, I am constrained to agree with the court below that the observations
made were not necessarily adverse to the prisoner or calculated to bias the
minds of the jury against the prisoner, nor do I think the result of the trial
was influenced by what the jury heard. The irregularity, therefore, is not, in
my opinion, sufficient to invalidate the trial and verdict.

As to the second
question reserved, if the objection to the question was to the competency of
the witness to answer it it was a preliminary question for the

[Page 408]

judge with reference
to which the prisoner's counsel might have cross-examined the witness or
offered evidence to establish the witness's incompetency.

In this case the
witness does not appear to have been cross-examined and no evidence was offered
on the prisoner's behalf to show a want of capacity.

The case states that
Dr. McKay was produced as a witness on behalf of the crown, and gave evidence
establishing his competency to speak as a medical expert but not as an expert
in any other particular, and he was not, it appears to me, asked to speak in
any other capacity than as a medical man.

In the absence,
then, of any cross-examination as to the witness's capacity or qualification,
or any evidence before the question was answered to establish, as a preliminary
question to be decided by the judge, that the question was not one of medical
or surgical skill, and therefore Dr. McKay was not an expert, agreeing as I do
with the learned judge who tried this case that the presiding judge must form
his opinion of the witness's capacity to speak as an expert from the testimony
before him, I think on the primâ facie evidence before the judge he was justified
in allowing and could not properly have refused to allow the question to be
answered because it was distinctly put to the witness as a question of medical
science or skill. This the question and answer beyond all doubt established,
for the question is:

From your knowledge of medical science in
this respect and from your examination in this case, at how great or how less a
distance would the muzzle of the gun be from a human body at the time of the
discharge?

This was the
question objected to and the answer to it was:

Judging from what I saw, from the nature of
the wound and its appearance, I would say that the muzzle of the gun was not
nearer than twenty inches, and not further away than three feet when it was
discharged.

[Page 409]

If the question was
open to objection at the time it was put, it seems to me such objection was
removed by the course pursued at the trial and it is not now open to the
prisoner.

The prisoner's
counsel did not confine his cross-examination to the competency of the witness,
but appears to have interrogated as to the reasons the witness had for saying
the muzzle of the gun was not nearer than 20 inches, one of which was that he
saw no traces of burning and he says:

Independently of burning altogether I can say
it could not have been any nearer than twenty inches.

And again:

In reference to burning I based my opinion as
to distance not so much as to the absence of burning as from the size of the
wound and the jagged nature of the edges.

Here the witness was
clearly speaking as a medical expert, and thus the counsel brought out the very
evidence he had, at a previous stage of the case, himself objected to. Had he
intended to rely on the objection previously taken in my opinion he should, on
cross-examination, have refrained from bringing out the very same testimony to
which, on the direct examination, he had objected, thus making it his own.

Under all these
circumstances I think the appeal should be dismissed.

STRONG J.—In this case I am compelled to differ from the
Chief Justice and, I believe, from the majority of the court. I am of opinion
that the judgments of the Chief Justice and of Mr. Justice McDonald in the
court below were correct and that the question objected to was improperly
allowed.

There can be no
doubt as to the rule established in practice and by incontrovertible authority,
that no evidence of matters of opinion is admissible except where the subject
is one involving questions

[Page 410]

of a particular
science in which persons of ordinary experience are unable to draw conclusions
from the facts. The jury must, as a general rule, draw all inferences
themselves and witnesses must speak only as to facts.

The only ground on
which the ruling of the learned judge at the trial, as to the admissibility of
this evidence, could be sustained is that the matter is one involving
experience and skill in medical science. I cannot agree in the opinion that it
is. Following the line of argument of the Chief Justice of Nova Scotia I think
the evidence depends on other considerations than those of medical science,
namely, the description of the gun, the size of the bore, the charge of powder
and other facts, none of which came within the range of that peculiar
observation and study which qualifies a medical expert to pronounce an opinion.
It appears to me very obvious that a person familiar with the use of fire-arms,
for instance a gun-maker or an instructor of musketry accustomed to test and
use such weapons, would be more competent to pronounce an opinion on a point of
this kind than a medical man, and that, in the absence of evidence from such a
source, the jury should have been left to draw their own conclusions from the
facts.

The admissibility of
the witness as an expert, competent to state an opinion on the point in question,
was, of course, entirely a question for the judge, and it was for him to say,
in the first instance, whether Dr. McKay's testimony on this head came within
the required condition. But this ruling of the learned judge, though on a
question of fact, is open to review on appeal.

The witness himself
says that he had no personal experience in the use of fire-arms, which I think
is conclusive against the admissibility of his evidence,

[Page 411]

for I cannot agree
that the witness is to be considered as establishing his own competency by
merely stating that here were indicia known to him from his professional
studies, from which he was enabled to form a judgment as to the distance from
the deceased at which the gun which inflicted the fatal wound was fired.

As regards authority
it is remarkable that no English case in point is to be found. This, it seems
to me, is in the prisoner's favor since, if such evidence was admissible, the
reports would have contained records of, at least, some instances in which it had
been admitted.

American authority
is in the prisoner's favor for although there is no case in which the facts are
precisely similar the cases of Kennedy v. The People[24]; Cooper
v. The State[25];
Cook v. The Stale[26]
are all decisions which lay down principles at variance with those enunciated
by the court below and establish that the evidence ought not to have been
admitted.

As to the other
question I entirely agree with the observations of the Chief Justice with
reference to the impropriety of the clergyman's address, and also in the
opinion that it did not affect the regularity of the proceedings.

My conclusion is
that the appeal should be allowed and the conviction quashed.

FOURNIER J.—I think the evidence of Dr. McKay, produced as an
expert, should not have been allowed. His knowledge of the matters as to which
he testified was very slight. He was brought as an expert to speak, from his
own experience and knowledge, as to what distance the gun must have been from
the body when fired. This is what he says himself:—

There are indicia in medical science
from which it can be said at

[Page 412]

what distance small shot were fired at the
body. I have studied this—not personal experience—but from books.

This being a matter
of opinion, and not a fact at all, unless he was really an expert should not
have been allowed. The character of the evidence must have had great weight
with the jury.

I agree with the
opinion expressed by Chief Justice McDonald in the court below, and I think the
conviction bad on this ground.

There is another
objection as to which I agree with the observations made by all the judges in
both courts. It was certainly a great indiscretion on the part of the clergyman
to make the remarks he did in the presence of the jury, but the remarks were of
such a general character that I do not think the jury could have been
influenced by them. I agree with the observations censuring such conduct.

TASCHEREAU J.—I am of opinion that this appeal should be
dismissed.

As to the first
objection raised by the appellant, that is to say, the one relating to what the
Rev. Mr. Brown said in the course of his sermon, in the presence of the jury,
there is nothing in it. The reverend gentleman, far from saying anything
hostile to the prisoner, actually appealed to the mercy of the jury in his
favor. But even if he had expressed himself in terms that might have been
construed against the prisoner that would not nullify the verdict. The case of The
Attorney General v. Wright[27],
is altogether against the appellant on this point.

The second point is
whether the answer of Dr. McKay to the following question was rightly admitted
in evidence:—

From your knowledge of medical science in
this respect, and from your examination in this case, at how great or how less
a distance wonld the muzzle of the gun be from a human body at the time of the
discharge?

[Page 413]

The answer was as
follows:—

Judging from what I saw, from the nature of
the wound and its appearance, I would say that the muzzle of the gun was not
nearer than twenty inches, and not further away than three feet, when it was
discharged.

The contention is,
that this was a question which could only have been put and answered by an
expert, and that the witness was not shown to have been an expert on that
subject.

The witness further said:—

There are indicia in medical science
from which it can be said at what distance small shot were fired at the body. I
have studied this—not personal experience—but from books.

In cross-examination
he says:—

I based my opinion as to the distance, not so
much as to the absence of burning as from the size of the wound and jagged
nature of the edge.

I am of opinion that
this evidence was admissible for the reasons given by my brother Gwynne, whose
elaborate notes I have read. I could add nothing to his reasoning on the
subject.

GWYNNE J.—The appeal in this case must, in my opinion, be
dismissed. As to the point reserved in relation to the observations made by the
minister in his sermon to his congregation knowing the jury who were charged
with the case of the accused to be present, it is obvious that the case of the
appellant could not have been prejudiced by such observations for, however
unseemly it was for the minister to assume to address any observations to the
jury under the circumstances, the particular observations were in the interest
of the accused and substituting the word ""mercy"" for
""equity"" were such as might have been addressed to the jury by the
judge who tried the case.

The other point
reserved relates to the propriety of the surgeon who made the post mortem
examination of the deceased being permitted to express his opinion as to
certain facts which he observed on the post mortem examination.

[Page 414]

After he had given
evidence of the injuries which he found upon the body of the deceased—of the
nature of the wound (a gun shot wound) which was the cause of death—of its
external appearance and its internal effects—and having stated that he had
examined the wound particularly with a view of discerning the distance which
the gun might have been from the deceased at the time of the infliction of the
wound he was asked—

From your knowledge of medical science in
this respect, and from your examination in this case, at how great or how less
a distance would the muzzle of the gun have been from the body at the time of
the discharge?

To this question
although objected to (the objection having been overruled) the witness replied
as' follows,

Judging from what I saw—from the nature of
the wound and its appearance I would say that the muzzle of the gun was not
nearer than twenty inches and not further away than three feet when it was
discharged. The carrying capacity of the gun and the nature of the charge, and
the condition of the gun as regards cleanliness and the shape of the hole would
modify the distance as given by me. There are cases on record where the gun was
a much greater distance than I have described and produced such a wound as I
have described. In my opinion it would be impossible for a man after receiving
such a wound to walk six feet, turn, and sit down. If a man had been shot
standing upright and I found him at a distance of six feet sitting down after
such a wound as I have described, I would expect to find blood all down his
legs and pants and into his shoes and probably on the ground, (if it were
possible for a man to do that) for with such a wound the heart would cease to
beat instantly after such a wound.

Assuming the
admission in evidence of this opinion to have been an irregularity, the verdict
of the jury does not for that reason become necessarily vitiated. It is not
every irregularity that will vitiate a verdict, but only such an one from which
it clearly appears, or can at least be reasonably affirmed that the case of the
accused has been or may have been unjustly prejudiced thereby.

Now, it is difficult
to conceive how such prejudice could hare arisen in the present case, by reason
of this

[Page 415]

opinion of the
surgeon who had made the post mortem examination, for he stated fully the facts
observed by himself, upon which his opinion was founded as to the particular
fact inferred from those which he had' observed; if those facts did not justify
the opinion the attention of the jury could not have failed to have been drawn
thereto both by counsel for the prisoner and by the judge, and that this was
done by the prisoner's counsel appears from the cross-examination of the
witness. If the opinion was well founded I cannot see how it can be said that
any injustice was done to the prisoner by its admission, and if upon
cross-examination or otherwise it could have been shown to have been founded on
insufficient facts it is not likely to have had any effect upon the jury. The
contention, however, is not that the opinion was not well-founded, but that the
question which the jury had to decide, namely, as to the guilt or innocence of
the prisoner, should have been left to them without the aid of the opinion of
the witness upon the fact as to which he gave the opinion, and that the mere
admission of the opinion as evidence constituted such an irregularity as in
point of law avoids the verdict. No case directly in point has been cited in
support of this proposition and, in my opinion, it is not one for which the
ends of justice demand that a precedent should be made. But the admission of
the opinion in evidence did not, in my judgment, constitute any irregularity;
the opinion was one the admission of which was justified by precedent as coming
within a recognized exception to the general rule. It is not necessary to
discuss here how far the authority of Carter v. Boehm[28], Durrell
v. Bederley[29],
and Campbell v. Richards[30],
has been shaken by modern decisions, for the opinion given by the witness in
the present case was not upon a question which was

[Page 416]

the very one which
the jury had to decide, as were the
questions upon which the
opinions of the insurance broker were offered in evidence in the above cases.

The questions in
these easels were—whether, in the opinion of the witnesses offered, certain
matters not disclosed to underwriters were material to have been and should
have been disclosed and whether, if they had been disclosed, the policies would
have been entered into. This was the very point which the juries in those cases
had to decide. Here the case is very different; the question which the jury had
to pass upon was the guilt or innocence of the prisoner in respect to the
felony with which he was charged. This was not the question upon which the
opinion of the surgeon in the present case was called and given. His opinion
was formed upon facts observed by himself on the autopsy which he had made on
the body of the deceased, and was given as to another fact deducible from the
facts which had come under his direct observation and which, although it may
have been as material to enable the jury to arrive at a just conclusion upon
the question they had to decide as any other fact in evidence in the case was
material to that purpose, still his opinion so given can by no means be said to
have been one upon the very point the jury had to decide so as to make it
inadmissible upon that ground.

The contention,
however, is that, and it is no doubt in general terms true that, facts only
should be stated to the jury and the inferences to be drawn from those facts
should be left to them, and that therefore the witness's evidence should have
been confined to the facts which came under his observation, leaving the jury
to draw from his narrative of those facts their inference as to the other fact
if it was material: but the object of all judicial enquiry is to elicit truth,
and when a medical man gives evidence upon the trial of

[Page 417]

an indictment for
homicide as to matters observed by him upon a post mortem examination of
the deceased his evidence from the nature of the case must for the most part be
given in the form of his opinion; and when an inference as to the existence of
a fact not seen is to be drawn from the facts which were observed by himself on
the post mortem, his opinion as to the inference is not at all in the
nature of a decision on a fact to the exclusion of the jury, but is evidence of
a new fact not to admit which, if the fact inferred be relevant to the point in
issue and which the jury have to decide, would be to reject what was essential
to the investigation of truth; the fact which was sought to be established by
the opinion of the surgeon who made the post mortem was as to the
distance which the gun from which was discharged the charge of shot which
caused the death of the deceased may have been from his body when discharged;
that may have been an important fact which, in connection with other facts
appearing in evidence, may have materially aided in enabling the jury to arrive
at a sound and just conclusion upon the question they had to decide, namely,
the guilt or innocence of the prisoner.

Now the external
appearance of the wound, its shape and the jagged nature of the edge as well as
the internal effects found, were matters which gave to the skilful anatomist
and professional observer exceptional opportunity and peculiar knowledge enabling
him to arrive at a correct judgment as to the fact to establish which the
question was put to him, which no one but an actual and competent observer of
the wound, its character and its effects, could possibly have had, and which no
narrative of the appearance of the wound could convey to a jury who had no
opportunity of seeing the wound itself even if they had the skill to observe
its internal effects. The opinion, therefore, of

[Page 418]

the surgeon who did
observe the wound and who, as he says, examined it for the express purpose of
forming an opinion upon the fact as to which the question was put to him was
evidence which was admissible as to the fact inferred, and which was proper to be
submitted to the jury; indeed the case of Kennedy v. The People[31] upon which the learned
counsel for the appellant chiefly relied is an authority in support of this
view, for there it was held by the Court of Appeals for the State of New York
that the opinion of the surgeon who made the post mortem as to the
amount of force necessary to produce the wound which he found upon the deceased
was properly received in evidence. Now in the present case the question
objected to was one pointing precisely to the degree of force necessary to make
with a charge of shot the wound which the witness found upon the deceased, the
force in such case being to be estimated by the distance which the gun from
which the charge of shot came may have been from the body in order to make the
wound such as he found it to be. Mr. Wharton, in his work on criminal evidence,
gives very many instances of the admission of the opinions of witnesses as
evidence under circumstances similar to the present as, for example, among
others that certain hair upon a club was in the opinion of the witness human
hair and resembled the hair of the deceased—that a certain substance was hard
pan—that a certain person appeared to be in fear—that on being held to answer
he looked as if he felt badly—that the appearance of a blood-stain indicated
that the spirt came from below; and he lays it down as a general rule, in the
justice and propriety of which I entirely concur, and in support of which he
cites several authorities of the courts of the United States, namely, that it
is not necessary for a witness to

[Page 419]

be an expert to
enable him to give an opinion as to matter depending upon special knowledge
when he states the facts upon which he bases his opinions. In Alcock v. The
Royal Exchange Ins. Co.[32],
the Court of Queen's Bench, consisting of Lord Denman C. J., Coleridge,
Wightman and Erle JJ., held that in an action for a total loss of an insured
vessel, the captain having abandoned her, and the defence being that there had
been no total loss, a witness might be asked whether from what he had observed
of the captain's habits in ""A"" before the voyage he could form any
judgment as to his general habits of sobriety or intoxication.

So in an action for
words spoken or written a witness may be asked whether there had taken place
any thing which gave a peculiar character to the expressions used; and if there
had he may then be asked what in his opinion was the meaning intended by the expressions.
It is quite a common practice that a surgeon who has made a post mortem
examination of a deceased person on a case of homicide, should be asked whether
a wound which he found to be the cause of death had been in his opinion caused
by a blunt or a sharp instrument, whether a particular instrument produced and
shown to the jury could or could not, in his opinion have inflicted the fatal
wound[33].

Now, any intelligent
person provided he had examined the wound could form a sound judgment upon
questions of this nature, but the opinion of an intelligent surgeon who had
made the post mortem examination and who had applied his skill and
judgment in ascertaining the precise extent of the injury internally as well as
externally is no doubt the most competent person to give light upon the points
to a jury who had

[Page 420]

no opportunity, and
had not, perhaps, skill sufficient to enable them intelligently to examine the
wound if it could have been, shown to them and to observe the extent of its
effects.

So in the present
case there can be no doubt that a skilful surgeon who had carefully observed
not only the external appearance of the wound but the intensity of its internal
effects had exceptional advantages and knowledge which the jury could not have
had for estimating at what distance the gun when discharged may have been from
the deceased in order to have inflicted a wound of the nature, extent and
intensity which he found the wound to be which caused the death of the
deceased, and as the jury were entitled to have laid before them the best
evidence which can be procured upon all matters relevant to the determination
of the issue they had to decide, the evidence was, in my opinion, quite proper
to have been received, and to have been submitted to them for such weight as
they might think it to be entitled to after a cross-examination of the witness
and after hearing such other evidence, if any, as had been adduced calling in
question the soundness of the opinion of the witness as resting upon the facts
upon which he said he had based it, and hearing the comments of counsel.

Appeal dismissed with costs.

PRESENT.—Sir W. J. Ritchie
C. J., and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
QUEENSS BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE.)

Crown case reserved—Ch.
174 secs. 246 and 259 R. S.C— Construction of—Juror-—Personation of—Irregularity—Cured by
verdict.

B. having been found guilty of feloniously having administered
poison with intent to murder moved to arrest the judgment on the ground that
one of the jurors who tried the case had not been returned as such.

The general panel of jurors contained the names of Joseph Lamoureux and Moise Lamoureux. The special panel
for the term of the court, at which the prisoner was tried, contained the name
of Joseph Lamoureux. The sheriff served Joseph Lamoureux's summons on Moïse Lamoureux, and returned Joseph
Lamoureux as the party summoned. Moïse Lamoureux appeared
in court and answered to the name of Joseph and was sworn as a juror without
challenge when B. was tried. On a reserved case it was

Held, per Ritchie C. J., and Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.,
that the point should not have been reserved by the judge at the trial, it not
being a question arising at the trial within the meaning of sec. 259 ch. 174 R.
S. C.

Held also, per Taschereau and Gwynne JJ. affirming the
judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, that assuming the point could be reserved
sec. 246 ch. 174 R. S. C. clearly covered the irregularity complained of.
Strong and Fournier JJ. dissenting.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for
Lower Canada on a case reserved by Mr. Justice Henri Taschereau at the Criminal
Assizes of the district of Terrebonne, January, 1888.

The case reserved was as follows:

The indictment in this cause found by the Grand Jury alleged
that the accused on the 29th of August,

[Page 422]

1887, in the Parish of St. Benoit, District of Terrebonne, had feloniously administered to
Francois Xavier St. Denis, one ounce of a certain
poison called "" Paris Green,"" with the intent then and there to
commit murder, on the person of the said Francois Xavier St.
Denis.

The trial of the accused took place on the 14th, 16th &
17th of January instant, and terminated in a verdict of guilty rendered by the
petty jury sworn for the trial.

After the rendering of the verdict, the advocate for the
accused made the following motion in arrest of judgment:

""Motion of the said Osias Brisebois, for arrest of
judgment in this cause and that the verdict rendered against him on the 17th
day of January instant be set aside and annulled and that the said Osias
Brisebois be, if not liberated and discharged, at least afforded a new trial,
to be held immediately, or at the approaching criminal assizes for this
district, for among other reasons the following:

"" Because it appears by the record and the minutes of
this court that during the trial in this cause Joseph Lamoureux a resident of
the Parish of St. Monique, in the said district, duly
qualified and found on the list of petty jurors duly revised for the district
of Terrebonne, deposited in the office of the sheriff of this district, and،
further, found and mentioned on the panel of petty jurors, bound to serve and
to act as such during the trial of the said Osias Brisebois, did not answer
himself in person to the calling of his name, but that another person, of the
name of Moïse Lamoureux, also a resident of the said
Parish of St. Monique, in said district, answered falsely
and illegally to the calling of the said name of Joseph Lamoureux and did serve
and Was sworn as a petty juror under the name of Joseph Lamoureux
in the trial of the said Osias Brisebois,

[Page 423]

instead and in place of the said Joseph Lamoureux.""

On this motion the advocate of the prisoner and the deputy of
the Attorney General produced respectively affidavits and documents by means of
which the following facts are established:

The general list of persons qualified as jurors contains at
the same time the names of Joseph Lamoureux and of Moїse Lamoureux both
described as farmers of the Parish of St. Monique, concession of La
Côte des Saints.

The special panel of petty jurors bound to serve during the
term contained the name of Joseph Lamoureux, farmer, St. Monique.

Although the properties of the said two persons are situated
in the said concession of La Côte des Saints, it appears
that Moїse Lamoureux only had his residence on the road in front of the
said concession, while Joseph Lamoureux had built on the road in front of the
neighbouring concession of La Côte St. Jean.

The sheriff went himself to make the service on the petty
jurors and going to the domicile of Moïse Lamoureux and
without ascertaining his Christian name asked him if he was the only Lamoureux
living in this concession. On the reply being in the affirmative by the said Moïse Lamoureux who believed, and who still appears to believe,
that Joseph Lamoureux belongs to the concession of La Côte St.
Jean, the sheriff gave to the said Moïse Lamoureux
personally the summons intended for Joseph Lamoureux. Moїse
Lamoureux obeyed this summons, answered during all the criminal term,
and in particular at the trial of the accused cused, to the name of Joseph
Lamoureux, was sworn as a juror in the said trial of the accused in the accused
of any challenge, and thus formed part of the

[Page 424]

jury which rendered against the accused a verdict of guilty.

It is further in evidence that the accused at the time of the
trial, and before, knew Moїse Lamourx, although he
did not know his Christian name.

The evidence and these documents produced do not show that the
prisoner had any cause of challenge against Moїse Lamoureux
who served under the name of Joseph Lamoureux.

The special panel for the term did not contain the name of Moїse Lamoureux.

On this motion and in view of these facts I did not pronounce
sentence against the accused,who was remanded to prison, and I thought it my
duty to reserve the question for the consideration of the judges of the Court
of Crown Cases Reserved; although an important precedent exists in the matter,
reported in the 3 vol. of the Q.L.R.,P.212, Reg. v. Fiore,and
although the 246th sec. of ch.174 of the Revised Statutes of Canada appears
applicable to the case, I have found the question sufficiently special to merit
the consideration of the honorable tribunal to which I have referred it

The Court of Queen's Bench Mr. Justice Tessier dissenting
refused to interfere with the verdict and the prisoner then appealed to the
Supreme Court of Canada.

Leduc (Belcourt with him) for
appellant.

respondent.

The points and cases relied on by the counsel are fully
reviewed in the judgments hereinafter given.

Sir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.
This was a case reserved under the Revised Statutes ch. 174 sec. 259 which
enacts that every court before which any person is convicted on indictment for
any treason, felony or misdemeanor, and every judge within the meaning of

[Page 425]

""The Speedy Trials Act,"" trying any person under such act, may, in its or his discretion,
reserve any questing of law which arises on the trial, for the consideration of
the justices of the court for crown cases reserved, and thereupon may respite
execution, &c.""

I am of opinion this was not a question arising at the trial,
but it was an objection raised subsequent to the trial, and which could only be
determined on a writ of error and could not be reserved and disposed of in a
summary manner on affidavits. I am therefore of opinion that as this was not a
question arising on the trial which could be reserved, the Court of Queen's
Bench in Montreal had no jurisdiction to adjudicate on the case and
consequently we have none, the prisoner's remedy, if any, being by writ of
error. Mr. Justice Gwynne has permitted me to peruse what he has written and
will read on this point, and as he has discussed the point so fully and I
entirely agree with what he has written and with the conclusion at which he has
arrived I have nothing further to add. I do not wish it, however to be
understood that there should be a writ of error granted in this case, or to
express any opinion as to what should or would be the result, if a writ of
error was granted.

It has been also contended that this case comes within and is
covered by sec. 246 of ch. 174 of the R. S. C. which enacts inter alia: ""
Judgment, after verdict upon "" an indictment for any felony or misdemeanor
shall "" not be stayed or reversed * * for any misnomer or ""
mis-description of the officer returning such process "" ( jury process),
or of any of the jurors,—nor because "" any person has served upon the jury
who was not "" returned as a juror by the sheriff or other officer.'' If I
am right in the view I take upon the first point the determination of this
question is not necessary for the disposal of this case, therefore without expressing
a

[Page 426]

positive opinion I may say I
incline very strongly to the view that if this case does not come within the
very words of the act it is within the spirit and scope of the enactment and
within the intent, policy and object if the legislature or, as Lord Coke
expressed it, to suppress the mischief and advance the remedy.

STRONG J.—I am of opinion that we ought to allow this appeal,
quash the conviction and order a new trial.

The prisoner was indicted for a
statutory felony—administering poison with intent to commit murder— and was
convicted. At the conclusion of the trial and before sentence, it was
discovered that Moїse
Lamoureux, one of the jurymen by whom he
had been tried, had not been returned on the panel, but had either by mistake
or design, which it does not appear, answered to the name of Joseph Lamoureux,
a juryman who had been duly returned on the panel, and thus by personating the
latter had been sworn in his place. The learned judge before whom the trial
took place. reserved the case for the opinion of the Court of Queen's Bench on
its appeal side pursuant to section 259 of the Criminal Procedure Act. The case
having been argued before the Court of Queen's Bench, that court affirmed the
conviction; one of the learned judges however, Mr. Justice Tessier, having
differed from his colleagues, the prisoner was enabled to appeal to this court,
which be has done,

I am of opinion that Mellor's
case (1), which has been relied on as a conclusive authority against this
appeal, has no application here. In the first place the learned judges who
there held there had been no mistrial, did so on the ground that William
Thorniley, who by mistake appeared and was sworn in answer to the name of
Joseph Henry Thorne, 

[Page 427]

the person actually called, was himself a juror, whose name
was contained in the panel duly returned by the sheriff. The prisoner in that
case was not able to make the objection that he was
tried by a jury, one of whom had no authority to try him. The case there was
merely one where one juror was mistaken for another, and it is upon this
circumstance that the judgments of those judges who held there had been no
mistrial were principally rested, as will be seen from the clear statement of
the argument from that point of view presented in the judgment of Mr. Justice
Byles. The same argument is not available here, in answer to the prisoner's
objection that he has been illegally tried, for it is manifest that only eleven
out of the twelve jurors who had the prisoner in charge had authority to try
him.

Next, I cannot agree with the learned chief justice of the
Queen's Bench in the opinion that this is an objection covered by the 246
section of the Criminal Procedure Act, (R. S. C. cap. 174). That section is a
transcript, so far as the clause is concerned which enacts that a verdict shall
not be "" stayed or reversed because any person has served upon the jury
who was not returned as a juror by the sheriff or other officer,"" of the
English Statute 7 Geo. 4c. 64 s. 21. This enactment was not referred to in
Mellor's case for the very obvious reason that it did not apply since both the
juror called and the juror who presented himself and was sworn in his stead had
been legally "" returned as jurors by the sheriff,"" and therefore, the
case did not come within the terms of the statute. Here, however, the person
sworn on the jury was not duly returned and therefore it has been said that the
statute applies. There is, however, in the present case something more than the
irregularity which the statute Was designed to cure, the mere serving on the jury of a person not

[Page 428]

duly returned by the sheriff to serve. Not only was the juror
who illegally served here not duly returned, but he personated one who was duly
returned, and in that way a wrong has been practised on the prisoner, a wrong
which, if done knowingly, was undoubtedly a high contempt of court and an
indictable offence, and if done innocently and by mistake may nevertheless have
greatly prejudiced the prisoner on his trial. If section 246 covers a case like
this, so it would also cover a case where the personation of the juror was the
result of a deliberately planned fraud, a conspiracy between the juror actually
summoned and a stranger personating him, with the very purpose and design of
introducing upon the jury a person whose object it might be corruptly to
convict the prisoner. It is impossible to suppose that the statute could apply
to validate the trial in such a case, and if it would not it must also be
inapplicable in the present case.

The whole tenor of the reasoning of the judges who thought
there was no mis-trial in Mellor's case favors this view.

Further Mellor's case can be no authority against the prisoner
on the question of mis-trial. Of the fourteen learned judges who composed the
court in that case, two, Chief Baron Pollock and Mr. Justice Wiliiams, gave no
opinion on this point, but rested their judgments exclusively on the ground
that the court had no jurisdiction to entertain the question reserved. The remaining twelve judges were equally divided on this
point—six, including Lord Campbell C.J., Cock burn C.J., Coleridge and Wightman
JJ., and Watson and Martin BB., holding distinctly that there had been a
mis-trial, whilst the remaining six judges were of a contrary opinion. It is
evident, therefore, that on this point of the nullity
or validity of the trial Mellor's case can be of no decisive authority, and we are

[Page 429]

thrown back on the preceding authorities and on the reasons,
apart from authority, for and against the view contended
for on behalf of the prisoner, reasons which are stated with great force and
lucidity in the opposing judgments delivered in Mellor's case. As regards the
effect which this case of Mellor ought to have upon our decision on this
appeal, I cannot, however, refrain from saying that although their judgments
were neutralized by the voices of an equal number of judges on the opposite
side, yet the weight of high authority and of great names is decidedly with the
six judges who pronounced for the prisoner, and I more especially refer to the
two most distinguished judges whose names head the list, who successively
filled the office of Lord Chief Justice of England, and whose pre-eminence as
great common law judges cannot be questioned,—Lord Campbell and Sir Alexander
Cock-burn.

The only authority in which the facts resemble those in the
present case, where a juryman whose name was on the panel and who had been duly
summoned in his proper name was personated by a stranger whose name was not on
the panel and who had received no summons to serve is the civil case of Hill
v. Yates ([1]),
where the Court of Queen's Bench did certainly refuse a rule nisi for
a new trial on this ground. I consider that case, however, to be virtually
disposed of in the judgment of Lord Campbell in Mellor's case where its
unsoundness is most conclusively demonstrated. The reasons thus given by Lord
Campbell are in the main the same as those which I have already stated as being
an answer to the argument raised on behalf of the crown that the prisoner's
objection in the present case Was met by the 246th section of the Criminal
Procedure Act, viz., that if the irregularity were to be considered

[Page 430]

as a ground of challenge only, and as not invalidating the
trial, the consequence would be, that there would be no remedy, where the
wrongful substitution of a stranger for a juror took place with the deliberate
and malicious intent of prejudicing the prisoner on his trial. These reasons
seem to me un-answerable in a case like the present, where the juror regularly
called has been personated by one who was not himself on the panel whatever
weight they ought to have in a case like Mellor's where the person sub stituted
was himself a juror, duly summoned and on the panel, and thus legally selected
and having authority for the trial of the prisoner subject only to the latter's
right of challenge. I am of opinion, therefore, that we ought not to consider
ourselves bound by Hill v. Yates, more especially as that case
was not a decision of a Court of Error or Appeal but of a court of first
instance only, and moreover a decision pronounced in a civil cause and on a
motion for a new trial.

As regards the comparative weight of the reasoning. apart from
authority, upon which the respective views of the learned judges in Mellor's
case are supported it seems to me that the reasons of Lord Campbell and the
judges who agreed with him far outweigh the arguments put forward by those who
held opposite opinions.

In Mellor's case the arguments against the prisoner on the
point of mis-trial appear to have been principally of two kinds, first those
which depended on the important circumstance, which distinguishes that case
from the present, that the person who was there substituted for the juror
called was himself a juror, whose name was regularly upon the panel, a
consideration which makes all the reasons so based entirely inapplicable here,
and secondly arguments deduced

[Page 431]

from considerations of public policy, and the inconvenience of
a judicial decision which might open the door to a class of frivolous,
technical objections tending in some instances to a failure of justice in the
administration of the criminal law. That public inconvenience may possibly be
occasioned by holding the objection now raised by the prisoner a ground for
invalidating the conviction, may to a certain extent be true but that does not
constitute a sufficient reason why a prisoner should be deprived of a fair
trial, as he certainly might be if the contrary rule should now be enunciated
by authority. The fallacy in the argument thus derived from public policy and
convenience is that those who advance it contemplate that this species of fraud
on the law, by the personation of jurors in criminal cases will only be
perpetrated in the interest of prisoners, whereas it is apparent that it may
also be resorted to by those who may seek to injure and prejudice prisoners in
their trials, and so long as the last alternative is possible an argument
derived from the mere probability that such an abuse of justice will be more
frequently practised on behalf of accused persons than against them ought not
to prevail. In other words, there is no higher policy known to the common law
of England than that which seeks to assure to every person brought under
criminal accusation an absolutely fair and impartial trial. The courts have it
in their own power to protect themselves, at least in a great degree, against
any misapplication of a rule of procedure, involved in a decision of this
appeal in favor of the prisoner by enforcing greater caution and diligence on
their own officers, by seeing that proper accommodation is provided for jurymen
summoned on the panel so that they may be kept apart from the crowd of mere
spectators who throng the courts, and by enforcing exemplary punishment when a
case of wilful personation is

[Page 432]

discovered; by these means the anticipated evil which, after
all, is probably chimerical, will seldom be likely to cause a failure of
justice. But even though the danger were a hundredfold greater it ought not, in
my judgment, to weigh for a moment against the sacred right of a prisoner to
have a fair trial, a right which it is impossible he can in the future enjoy if
the judicial sanction of a court of appeal is now given to proceedings by which
the prisoner was not only deprived of his right of
challenge but possibly tried and convicted by a juror who may have introduced
himself upon the jury for the express purpose of prejudicing the trial against
him. Lord Campbell, in his judgment in Mellor's case, answers this argument
from public inconvenience thus conclusively:

There may certainly be a dread that frivolous objections to
procedure in criminal cases may be encouraged by our decision; but it is no
frivolous objection that the prisoner on a trial for murder was, without any
fault of his own, deprived of his right to challenge one of the jurymen who
tried him, and I hope the Judges may safely rely upon their own efforts, and,
if necessary, upon the aid of the legislature, to repress mere technicalities,
which seek to screen guilt instead of protecting innocence.

Sir Alexander Cock burn in his judgment is equally pronounced
against this argument derived ab inconvenienti. We have therefore these
great chief justices, both of whom were most experienced criminal lawyers and
who had both served in the office of Attorney General before their promotion to
the bench, repudiating in the most clear and emphatic manner this argument by
which it was sought to infringe on a prisoner's right to a fair trial. I have
never read or heard that either of the chief justices was liable to be
influenced by sentimental considerations in favor of prisoners; the traditions
of the profession are, as I have always heard, rather to the contrary; we may
therefore safely assume, that in a case like the present they would have
considered the nullity of the trial beyond all doubt or question. In short
Mellor's case, so far

[Page 433]

from being authority against the prisoner on this point as to
the validity of the trial, is in truth a strong one in his favor, inasmuch as
the opinions of the six judges (including the two chief justices) who there
pronounced for the prisoner are, a fortiori, applicable here, whilst the opinions of the six judges, who were there against
the prisoner applied to an. irregularity of a totally different kind
from that which occurred on the trial now under consideration. I am, therefore,
of opinion .that there was such a miscarriage in the trial of the appellant.
that at common law the whole proceeding was a nullity Further,
I hold that the trial having thus been illegal and void at common law, the
246th sec. of the Criminal Procedure Act does not for the reasons before stated
cure such irregularity and that it has therefore no, application whatever to
the case.

Next it is argued for the crown that the 259th:sec. of the
Criminal Procedure Act providing for the-reservation of questions of law
arising on the trial of indictments does not apply, and Mellor's case is again
invoked as an authority for this proposition also. Here,
again, I Have to determine against the crown, The great argument against the
jurisdiction in Mellor's case was that there was no power conferred on the
court to issue a venire de novo, so that if the conviction should have
been quashed the prisoner must have gone free. The court there, like the court
for crown cases reserved under the present statute, was a purely statutory
court, and had no authority save such as was conferred upon it by the express
words, or by necessary implication from the express words, of an act of
Parliament. Had the facts been as here showing indubitably that there had been
a mistrial, and had the statute conferred the powers now given by sec. 268 of
the Criminal Procedure Act, and which applied to the Court of Queen's Bench as
well as it applies to this

[Page 434]

court, authorizing the granting of a new trial, (a
substitution for the common law remedy of a venire de novo)
where "" the conviction is declared bad for a cause "" which makes
the former trial a nullity so that there "" was no lawful trial in the
cause;"" had, I say, the English statute conferred such a power as this the
principal ground of the argument against the jurisdiction in Mellor's case
would have entirely failed. As the act of parliament now enables the courts
here to do justice by remanding the prisoner for a new trial, I can see no
objection to holding that the Court of Queen's Bench had jurisdiction to
entertain this objection to the validity of the conviction as "" a question
arising on the ""trial,"" as I feel assured the English court would
also have done in Mellor's case had the opinion of Lord Campbell and those who
agreed with him, that there had been a mis-trial, prevalled and had the statute
in terms conferred the ""power to order a venire de
novo or the power which this court and the Court of Queen's Bench
now possess of ordering anew trial.

I am of opinion that the trial of the appellant should (in the
words of the statute be declared to have been a ""nullity,"" that the
conviction should be quashed and a new trial ordered.

FOURNIER J.―Aux assises du district
de Terrebonne tenues en janvier dernier
Osias Brisbois a subi son procés pour avoir félonieusement
administré un certain poison à F. X. Denis dans l'intention de commettre un meutre, et un verdict do coupable a
été prononcé contre lui. Après ce verdict, le prisonnier a fait, par le
ministère de son avocat une motion en arrêt de jugement pour faire annuler le
verdict ordonner sa mise en liberté ou pour un nouveau procès.

L'unique raison donnée à l'appui de cette motion
est que le nom do Moïse Lamoureux, qui a fait partie du petit jury qui l'a tronvé
coupable, ne se trouve pas

[Page 435]

sur la liste des jurés assignés pour le terme
pendant lequel le prisonnier a subi son procés. Le nom de Joseph. Lamoureux,
son frére, s'y trouve; mais celui-ci n'ayant pas été assigné, a, comme de raison, fait
défaut chaque fois que son nom a été appelé comme juré. A chacun de ces appels,
Moïse Lamoureux, qui avait reçu, par erreur, l'assignation destinée à Joseph,
s'est présenté à la place de celui-ci et a illégalement prêté serment comme
juré, siégé comme tel, pris part au verdict—sous le nom do son frére—sans avoir prêté ser* ment
sous son nom. ni révélé son identité en aucune
manière. Cette étrange irrégularité n'a été découverte qu'après le verdict,
mais avant que aucune sentence n'eût encore été prononcée. C'est en se fondant
sur ce fait que le prisonnier demande l'arrêt du jugement et l'annulation du
verdict.

L'honorable juge H. T. Taschereau, qui présidait qui procès de laccusé, après lexposé des faits contenüs dans la motion et après leur verification par affidavits, en a fait rapport .à la cour du Banc de la Reine, rêservant à cette
dernière cour la décision de la question ainsi soulevée.

La majorité de la cour du
Banc de la Reine a rejeté cette motion pour le motif qu'elle considérait
l'ireégularité invoquée comme insuffisante pour faire annuler le verdict. En conséquenee de ce renvoi, appel à cetee cour.

La question à decider est donc de savoir si le
fait de Moïse Lamoureux, dont le nom n'était pas sur la liste des jures, appelé
et répondant au nom de Joseph La* moureux, dont le nom se trouvait sur cette
liste, prêtant serment et siégeant sous le nom de Joseph Lamoureux, sans avoir
lui-même prêté serment sous son propre nom, constitue une irrégularité
suffisante pour faire declarer le procés nul (mis-trial).

Cette question n'est pas nouvelle. Elle a été
soulevee bien des fois en Angleterre. L'honorable juge

[Page 436]

Ramsay dans ses notes sur la cause de Feore
(1), en a cité plusieurs cas d'où il a conclu:

I take it, therefore, that before the passing of the statute
21 of Jac. I the serving as juror of any person not a
juror, or one juror for another or by a name not his, or by a false addition,
or of any-disqualified person, would make the trial null,
and that is only modified in the Jac. I, and by. the section of our
Criminal .Procedure Act, 32 and 33 Vic, oh. 29, sec. 79. 

Cette dernière section est -maintenant remplacée par la;246me
section du chapitre .174,
Statuts revisés du Canada, déclarant que nul jugement après verdict ne* sera arrêté;
ni infirmé pour diverses raisons et- entre autres la suivante:

Ni à
-raison de ce qu'une personne aura servi le
jury, bien qu'e elle n'e au nombre des jurés sur le rapport du shérif.

Comme on le volt, le
texte qui concerne la, question soulevée ici se le
jugement ne sera pas arrêté parce qu'una personne dont
le nom n'était. pas sur la liste des
jures aura servi comma tel Ce serait bien faire application de cette disposition, si
Moïse Lamoreux, dont
le nom n'était pas sur la liste, eût été soit par méprise ou par
une erreur quelconque, appelé par son véritabee nom à faire
partie du jury. Une telle irrégularité aurait été
sans doute couverte par. la section 246. Mais les choses sont loin de s'être passées de
cette manière. Joseph Lamoureux dont le nom se trouvait régulièrement sur la
liste étant appelé, c'est Moïse qui se présente à sa place et le
personnifie. Il prête serment sous Un nom, qui n'est pas le sien et, s'ouvre
ainsi l'entrée du jury par in faux serment.
Il répète cette imposture à chaque fols que Joseph Lamoureux est appelé et il a
le soin de si bien cacher son identité qu'elle n'est découverte qu'après le
verdict. Est-ce une de ces irregularités couverte par la clause 246? Evidemment
non; la loi presume que le
jure dont le 

[Page 437]

nom n'est pas sur la liste a dû être appele son
nom. Elle ne peut certàinomënt pas s interpréter de
maniere à couvrir le cas de celui quia faussement pris
le nom d'un autre et jure faussement qu'il est
un tel, tandis qu'il est une autre personne. "" C'est-grâce à deux
offenses criminelles bien graves:
au faux serment et à la
personnification, que Moïse Lamoureux a réussi à pénétrer dans le jury. Pëut-on
dire que la loi' entendait traiter comme simple irrégularitele
fait dont Moïse Lamourëux s'est rendu coupable? Par
cetee supercherie, il a empêché lë prisonnier de se
prévaloir de son droit de récusation. Il pouvait n'avoir aucun motif ' de 'recuser
Joseph, mais il pouvait en avoir dôntre celui qui cachait son
nom sou ceiui de Josëph et s'introduisait d'une manière aûssi extraordinaire
dàns le jury. Qiel pouvait être ses motifs d'en
agir ainsi? Nous les ignorons; mais létrangeté et l'illégalité de sa
condutte ne font présumer rien de bon en sa faveur. On no devrait pas en être réduit
à des suppositions pOur s'assurer si le prisonnier a eu un
procès réguliér et impartial.

On a invoqué contre la
position prise par le prisonnier l'autorité de la
decision 'dans la bause' de Mellor (1), dans liquelle une question analogue s'est sonlevée
Cette decision a été citée et discutée dans la cour du Banc de la Reine de Québec,
dans la cause de Regina v Feore (1), mais la majorité
de la courn'a pas considéré qu'elle devatt avoir toute l'importance d'un précédeiit, parce que
sur la question à decider par la cour du Banc de la Reine, les juges anglais
s'éthient trouvés divisés également, six d'un côté et six de l'autre. Deux des
jugss qui furent d'avis de maintenir le verdict s'abs tinrent de decider la
question do savoir si l'objection eut été souleve d'une autre manière, elle eut
été fatale ou non. Jo no crois pas, pour los raisons données par

[Page 438]

l'honorable juge Ramsay, que l'on doive non plus doneer à la
decision dans la cause de Mellor l'autorité d'un précédent applicable à
celle-ci. Les questions en débat, il est vrai, ont été traitées avec beaucoup
de science et de, développement, mais pour répondre aux arguments employés par
les juges de la majorité, ii n'y a qu'à se servir des arguments encore plus
solides donnés par la minorité.

A l'objection faite, que la cour na pas
juridiction pour adjuger sur une question réservée, qui n'a été soulevée
qu'après le verdict, je répondrai par largument de
l'honorable juge Ramsay sur la même question dans la cause
de Regina v. Feore. Dans
la présente cause, l'objection a été faite
et réservée aprés le verdict, ii est vrai, mais avant qu'aucune sentence
n'eừt été prononcée.
L'honorable juge s'exprima ainsi:

With regard to the first of these points it
does not arise in this case, for the question was raised before the end of the
trial that is before sentence. But in any case it would be a very narrow mode
of interpreting an enactment such as that permitting the reservation of Crown
cases, to say that a question did not arise at the trial because it was not
insisted upon then. The question took its rise at the trial, although only
noticed after. Again, if under the statute the judge had not power to reserve
the question, he certainly could not have enlered the difficulty on the record,
and the accused would have been without remedy, whether he suffered injustice
or not, thus effectually avoiding all the inconveniences so much dreaded by
lord Ellenborough. The jurisprudence in this province is to give the fullest
possible scope to the enactment permitting the reservation of questions of law,
and I think our jurisprudence is more consistent than that in England on the
point.

Pour tous ces motifs, je
suis d'opinion que l'appel devrait être accordé.

TASCHEREAU J.—The
appellant having been found guilty of feloniously having administered poison
with intent to murder, moved to arrest the judgment on the ground that one of
the jurors who tried the case had not been returned as such. As this
irregularity did not appear on the face of the record it could

[Page 439]

clearly, not constitute a ground for a motion in arrest of judgment. A case having, however, been
reserved by the judge presiding at the trial, and determined, by the full court
of Queen's Bench, we have, I presume to consider it as properly before us on the
facts as stated in the court below, assuming, here, of course that the case
could be reserved.

These facts are as follows. The general panel of jurors
contained the two names of Joseph Lamoureux and of Moise Lamoureux. The special
panel for the term of the court at which the prisoner was tried contained only
the name of Joseph Lamoureux. The sheriff, however, served Joseph Lamoureux's summons on Moise Lamoureux, but returned Joseph Lamoureux as
the party summoned. Moise Lamoureux appeared in court, as
a juror, during the whole term answering to the name of Joseph Lamoureux and on
this Brisebois', trial, went in the box without challenge
having likewise answered to the name of Joseph Lamoureux.

I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed on the ground,
taken by the Court of Queen's Bench at Montreal viz.: ""that section 246
ch. 174 of the Rev Stat. clearly
covers the irregularity complained of by the appellant here."" This section
in express terms enacts that judgment shall not be stayed or reversed because
any person has served upon the jury who was not returned as a juror by the
sheriff. Now here the only irregularity complained of is that Moise Lamoureux
has served upon the jury, though not returned as a juror by the sheriff.

This is precisely what the statute says will not be a ground
for staying or reversing the judgment. The reason that in Mellor's case
(1), the corresponding Imperial enactment, 7 Geo. IV, c. 64, sec. 21 was not
cited

[Page 440]

is that the enactment had in that case, no application. There no question arose
of a patty serving as
a juror who had not been returned by the sheriff as such. Reg. v. Feore (1) has also
been relied upon by the appellant but that case
does not bind us, did it apply to-the present one. The case of Dovey v.Hobson:(1) is in point and would conclude this case
even without the above clause of our statute.

As to the question whether the point raised-was one which
could be reserved by the judge at- the trial, I am of opinion with the Chief
Justice and- Mr.J Justice Gwynne that it was not one which could be reserved.
Jam of opinion that-this appeal should -be-dismissed.

GWYNNE J.—In Mellor's case (1); the Court of Criminal Appeais in crown cases
resërved, upon the opinion of eight judges against six, affirmed the Conviction. Seven of the eight were of opinion that the
point submitted which was similar to that submitted in the present case did not come
within the jurisdiction of the court for hearing crown cases reserved; and that
it could only be raised if at all, upon a Writ of error as error in fact not érror in law Five Of the seven held that if so raised, the irregularity
which was complained of, constituted no mis-trial, in which opinion the eighth
also concurred but he gave no opinion
as to the jurisdiction of the court further
than that he doubted its having any jurisdiction to award a venire de novo; and the other two-gave no opinion
upon the question of mis-trial or no mis-trial,
because the point was not properly before them, not opening up on writ of error Of
the other six who were of opinion that the court had jurisdiction, and that the irrtegularity complained of did
constitute-mis-trial, two namely Cockburn"".- C. J. and Watson B expressed
themselves as having arrived

[Page 441]

at this opinion with great doubt and a third
Martin B. Tested his judgment upon the principle which he laid down, namely,
that in these cases of questions of law, reserved under the statute for the
opinion of the court of crown cases reserved, the statement of the judge as to
the facts upon which the question of law submitted by him depends must be
received by the court as absolute verity. If the questions which can be
reserved -under the statute are limited to questions upon matter appearing on
the record, as in arrest of judgment, and questions of law arising during the
progress of the trial which the judge presiding at the trial might have
judicially determined himself if he had been so minded; the principle that the
judge's statement of the facts upon which he wished to submit a question of law
to the opinion of the court should be received by the court as absolute verity
seems to be perfectly sound; but if the statement of facts made by the judge is
in all cases submitted under the statute to be received as absolute verity, that' to my mind affords a
conclusive argument against the question which was submitted in Mellor's case
and that which is submitted in the present Case being* within the contemplation
of the statute; for, in the absence of any provision in the statute
authorizing Or enabling a judge to collect material after verdict, upon which
to make a statement of facts for the purpose of submitting thereon a question
of law, the decision of which, may affèct the' verdict, I
cannot recognize the principle upon which such a statement
should be received as absolute verity; or why either the prisoner or the crown
should be deprived of their right to dispute the truth of the facts as settled
by the judge, or if true of displacing them by other facts proposed to be put
in course' of judical énquiry as they would have the right to do in the
case of a writ of error n fact; which appears to be the only proceeding by which the

[Page 442]

truth of the facts relied upon as being
sufficient to vacate the verdict or of other facts pleaded or relied upon as
displacing the effect of the former, assuming them to be true, can je
judicially established. The decision in Mellor's case has never been question a
that I have been able to find except in the case of The (Dussiz v. Feore
(1) in which case with great deference I say it the learned judges who set
aside the verdict do not seem to me to have correctly appreciated the grounds
upon which the judgments Of the learned judges who
affirmed the conviction in Mellor's case proceeded.

The case is cited as law in the edition of Roscoe’s
Criminal Evidence by Horace Smith of 1884 (1) and in a note to Chitty's
Statutes, 4th edition by Lely (2). The reasoning of those learned judges upon
both points is to my mind most conclusive. Pollock O.B. says.

Apart from the statute which created this tribunal 11.12. Vic.
ch. 78, the objection, if any, could not have been taken
except on à writ of error, and. the error, if error it be,
is error in fact and not error in law. In my judgment the statute was clearly
not intended to supersede the Court of Error and to confer upon this court all
its functions

And again:

The authority and jurisdiction of the court is, in my opinion,
limited to matters of law occurring upon the trial, of which the judge can take
judical notice, and in providing for giving effect to the decision of this
court and the certificate founded thereon there are express directions given as
to what shall be done in each case. It appears to me that the statute
contemplated the final determination of the matter and never contemplated any
new trial or any Venire de
novo

After reading the terms of the statute which I may here
observe are substantially identical with ours, the learned Chief Baron
proceeded:

It appears to me that the statute never contemplated any new
trial and I think that will be clear when we come to consider what are the
provisions made in the act. for they are very express and direct as to what
shall be done, upon the certificate going down to

[Page 443]

the court in which the point arose.

Referring then to the words of the statute that the court
is—to make such, other order as justice may require, he referred to Regina v. Faderman (1); in which it was held
that those words only enable the court to order a party to be let out on bail
or to do any other thing of the like kind which justice may seem to demand, and
he adds:

If this part of the act which enables us to make any other
order such as justice may require,"" is to be taken to apply to a case like
the present I should be glad to know why, if we can award a venire de novo, we cannot grant a new trial in
any case where improper evidence has been received, but which in reality was
not calculated to have any influence upon the verdict. If we are to award a venire
de novo, because the prisoner may have lost
some benefit, of which there is no suggestion before us, then I would ask, in a
case where, in the opinion of this court, improper evidence has been received
and where an entry upon the record would be that the evidence having been so
received the accused party was improperly convicted, what does justice require
in such a case? Why, manifestly that the prisoner, guilty of some atrocious
crime, should not thereby escape justice, and yet, I apprehend it will be
conceded on all sides (and I do not imagine from the communications which have
taken place among us that one single member of this court is of a different
opinion) that however much we might all think that justice would require a new
trial we should be incompetent to grant it. The act of Parliament provides
expressly what shall be done where the conviction is vitiated; We cannot order
a new trial in such a case: we can not order a venire de
novo to issue, we can only vacate the convection. And now I come to
the second point, that of providing for giving effect to the decision of the
court and the certificate founded upon it I shall read the very words of the
act.

The learned Chief Baron read from the statute which it may be
observed, is substantially identical with our own sec. 262 of ch. 174 which is
as follows:—

And the said certificate shall be sufficient warrant to such
sheriff or gaoler and all other persons for the execution of the judgment as so
certified to have been affirmed or amended and execution shall thereupon be
carried out on such judgment, or if the judgment has been reversed avoided or
arrested the person convicted shall be discharged from further imprisonment,
and the court before which

[Page 444]

he was convicted shall at its next
session vacate the* recognizance of bail if any.

The Chief Baron then proceeds—

This difficulty may arise; if we send back a certificate that
this conviction is bad I am not lure that the ma would not
be entitled to a habeas corpus to to know: why he is detained
and why the sheriff does not instantly discharge
him: and it
might be a most serious question whether he ought not, from
the plain. 'manifest and clear words of the act, instantly*to be discharged * *
there is provision for everything which is really contemplated by the àct. The sheriff is called In the event of
the Midnïght ''Being affirmed and
amended 'then execùtion But there is not a syllable in the
'act that points to any power in the sheriff, or anybody else to detáin 'the prîsoriér or in any court
to try him in the event of a*venire de novo issuing.
On these grounds in my judgment this court is not
competent to award a venire de novo, and, I think, that the remark, in a case I have already
cited that the prisoner ought with éqùal strêngth to ""the prosecution.

And he concludes his most exhaustive judgment thus:

In my judgment the prisoner ought to be left to his writ of
error, and as that is my opinion in point of law, giving to the statute my most
anxious and deliberate consideration, I abstain from giving any opinion whether
a writ of error ought, or ought not, to be granted, or what ought "" to be the result of a writ of error if it were
granted. assuming the facts to be-true. These matters are not in my judgment
properly now before the court and I think it best to abstain from giving any opinion
upon them. In my judgment this court has no authority to interfere, and I am
clearly of opinion without the slightest doubt or hesitation that this court
has not any power to award a venire de novo and
in that way grant a new trial. I think the awarding of a venire de novo belongs exclusively to a court of error. This
court by otherwise construing the words which have
been referred to do make such order as justice may require ""would not be expounding the act which alone
it has the province to do; but would, in fect, be legislating and taking
to itself an authority which the
legislature never intended to confer upon it.

The judgment of Erle J
is pronounced with equal force, that the objection taken constituted neither ground of error
""upon a writ of error nor' Lad' the court under the
statute constituting it a court for the consideration

[Page 445]

of crown cases reserved, jurisdiction to entertain it. He says:

It is alleged that the prisoner may have intended to challenge
Thorniley and have lost the opportunity because Thorne was called, and that
this possible loss of challenge is error vitiating
the trial. No authority,

He proceeds '.

has been adduced to show that such a mistake has ever been
held to be a ground of error.

He then reviews all the civil cases wherein a similar mistake
had occurred and thus states the conclusion to be
deduced from them.

According to these authorities a misnomer appearing
on-the-record is always ground of error if not amended, but it is no ground of
new trial if the person who was sworn was a person that was sum moned and no
injustice was done. The cases further show that if. a-person not summoned was
sworn in the name of one who was sum moned, it might or might not be ground of new trial; according to the
discretion of the court, 

or 

if a person not en the panel answers to the name of a person
on, the panel, such personation may or may not be ground of new, trial according
,to the discretion of the -court. 

As however all these cases were civil cases he adds: 

As they relate to verdicts at Nisi Prius they differ
materially from a verdict under a commission of Oyer and Terminer; with
respect to such a verdict one case only has been found, namely,
the case of a.juryman (1), where Joseph' Currie answered , to. the name. of Robert
Currie on the panel and the conviction was affirmed by twelve judges
unanimously, the summons having been served on Joseph Currie and the bailiff
intending he should serve.: This unanimous .opinion (he says).of the whole body
of judges is a decision against the principle relied on for the prisoner, viz:
That the variance between the name of the person called and the name of the
person sworn may have misled him in his-challenge-

And again:

The .possible hardship of having lost a challenge from
ignorance is no ground for vitiating a verdict as was said in Rex v.Sutton
(1); where an alien was sworn on the jury without the knowledge of the
defendant.'

And again:

[Page 446]

Thus far I have considered the question as if the court was in the present state of the record legally qualified
to decide whether a venire de novo should be
granted, but that writ is not lawful without , an entry on the record shewing a
valid ground for issuing it See Come? v. Shew (1). If in this
case it issued without legal ground ' appearing on the record the new trial
would be erroneous, and the verdict thereon no ground for judgment. It is
therefore necessary to see what entry could be made. 

And upon this point he says:

The entry must be according to the supposed fact and ought to
be traverseable so that the truth should be legally ascertained. That entry is
essential for a judgment in error, and I cannot assent to the notion that every
judicial officer who tries an indictment may receive a rumor and if he believes
it, make an entry accordingly, to vitiate a record otherwise correct and so
bind other parties and courts by an assumption which may be disputed; thus in
point of substanee there is no ground of error and in point of form no ground
of error appears on this record.

Then as to the statute under which the court of criminal
appeal for hearing reserved cases sat, he says:

The provisions of 11—12 Vic., oh. 78 are in terms confined to
judgments after conviction there is no authority given to alter the verdict in
any way—noneto treat a verdict as a nullity and to grant a new trial. The
anthority is express to vary the judgment in any Way, and even to enter, an
adjudication that the prisoner ought not to have been convicted, but the
verdict is to be left to stand notwithstanding such entry. It is true there is
a general power to make such order as justice may require; but this general
power follows after specific powers relating to judgments only, and the general
words, are to be restricted by the proceeding words and construed to be jusdem
generis*

Wiliiams J, was also of opinion that the point reserved did
not come within the statute 11— 12 Vic, ch 78. The questions contemplated by
the statute as authorized to be reserved were in his opinion,

questions of law which the judge before whom the case is tried
may reserve in his discretion, but he cannot reserve a point which he could not
have decided finally. If, he says, the- alleged mis-trial could have been cured
by a verdict, it would have been helped by the verdict which has been given; I
only mention this, he says to show that the point as it stands before us .must
be regarded as occurring

[Page 447]

after verdict. If that be so it seems to me to follow that it
is not a question of law which has arisen at the trial within the meaning of the
statute. Now, he continues, in the present case, if the point had been one
which could have formed ground for arresting judgment the presiding judge might
have decided it, for I do not mean to say that such a point may not be regarded
as arising at the trial within the meaning of the statute; but a point like the
present could not be raised in ' arrest of judgment. It could only in the
ordinary course of law be made the subject of a writ of error in fact and I am
of opinion that it was not intended by the statute to substitute this court for
a court of error, as to errors in fact. I do not see any
thing in the statute that enables the presiding judge to
collect the materials for such a tribunal It is said the point was brought to
the attention of the judge while he was still acting under the commission in
the assize town: but I am at a loss to know what power his commission gave him
to act in the matter. I think he might just as well have acted after as during
the assizes. There is no doubt that if his object were only to recommend the
prisoner to the crown for a pardon, on the ground that he had not been fairly
tried, the judge might collect information for the purpose at any time, and
from any source on which he though it right to rely. But when the object is to
ascertain whether a venire
de novo ought to be awarded on the ground that there
was error in fact, constituting a mistrial I can see no function the presiding
judge whether at or after the assize has to perform in the matter or which it
was meant by the statute to transfer from him to this court in any event

The learned judge was
further of opinion that it was
unnecessary for him to consider the question whether, if the point was before
the court expanded on the record on a writ of error, there ought to be a venire
de novo, as to this he says— 

It would be unbecoming in me, aware, as I am, of the
conflicting opinions of my brother judges, to treat this question other than as
a very doubtful one. I will only observe that if the facts stated for our consideration
had been assigned as error in the ordinary course the question might have
assumed a very different aspect if the crown had pleaded in answer to them (as
perhaps it might, ) that the juryman, William Thorniley, was personally well
known to the prisoner, and was seen by him to go to the book to be sworn and
that he never had any intention or wish to challenge that man

Crompton J. was of opinion that there was no ground which in
point of law, justified the court to interfere with the conviction He says: 

[Page 448]

The present
seems to me one of those cases where an irregularity has
occurred. in the çourse
of the proceedings which does
not necessarily vacate the verdict, but where
the court in which therecord is, in a civil action; or the
crown in the exercise of its prerogative, may interfere if
any .unfairness or real prejudice has occurred but,; where such interference is
only matter of discretion. And, again the argument
for the prisoner.,is:that he may
have, been prejudiced by
supposing from the fact of
the name of the other persou having been called, that the juryman he had
the opportunity of challenging was the person whose was really called, and so that he may a. have, lost the opportunity of
challenging the one whom he would have .wished. to(Challenge,;
I think the case is the same in principle'; as
that of the juryman in the note to Hill v. Yates.(1).
„ If, .he says-further dice to the-prisoner seems to me precisely the same I
am not .aware of any authority or case in which the-fact-that a prisoner
has-been . ignorant of some matter which might, have caused, him.;.-to
challenge a person ]who came ,the book to a verdict, in point of law, and
apprehend that it would not do so even if it
appeared that: the prisoner had been purposely misled, though it would be,
matter ibr, the, consideration of the court in .a. civil case in,. exercising their discretion in granting
a new trial, or for the advisers . the crown in
the exercise of the prergative.o mercy, It would be he
adds, most misehevqus if .every irregularity of this nature, however happening
and even if contrived by or, assented to by the, prisonerochis friends .would,
necessarily vacate a verdict if it would necessarily have that effect the same
principle would apply to the case of an acquittal, even though the irregularity
were caused by the prosecution I am not aware that no case has carried the doctrine so fa aswould be necessary to support
the objection inquestion arid.jin no. criminal cases has any similar objection
prevailed that I .am aware of. 

As to awarding a venire de novo
he says,

The books are full of authority to show that no de novo denovo can issue except on matter appearing on the
record sufficient to justify such award, and if it be improperly awarded it is
error.

And, again,

I will. not undertake to say how far any such objections the
present could properly be put upon the record if. a writ of error were brought,
and the judgment and proceeding had to be formally. entered on the record.

And, again,

In Hales's Pleas of the Crown (2) it appears
that if a juryman be returned as sworn it; cannot be-assigned for error that he
was not

[Page 449]

sworn.

And again:

But here we should
be proceeding on the alleged fresh discovery of facts after judgment without
anything on the record to justify us.

And again:

In the case of a writ of error and error in fact being
assigned, the crown in the case of a conviction, or the prisoner in the case of
an acquittal would have the right of traversing the matter so alleged and so
questioning its truth. I feel great difficulty in seeing how we can act without
there being some such opportunity afforded to the parties or, at all events,
without the matter being on the record. 

Crowder J. was of opinion that the case did not come within
the statute but assuming it to do so that there had been no mis-trial and that
before he could arrive at the conclusion that the verdict was a nullity for the
objection taken he must be satisfied that there exists some stringent and
inflexible rule of law which goes the length of avoiding every criminal trial
when such a mistake (however unattended with the slightest mischief) has
occurred and if there were any such rule of law which would render such a
mistake per se fatal, he should contemplate
with the utmost alarm the awful consequences which might ensue from it to the
administration of criminal justice throughout the country. Prisoners if
convicted might have another chance of escape or if acquitted might have their
lives and liberty again imperilled, for that if such a mistake be fatal it is
equally so whether the accused be acquitted or convicted and whatever might be
the nature of the crime with which he should be charged. "" But,"" he says,"" I can find no such rule of
law."" Then, referring to the case of a juryman, he says:

It was contended that there was a mis-trial but held by all
the judges that there was not but only a misnomer which did not invalidate the
trial

But he adds:

As regards the main ground on which it was contended before us
that there had been a mis-trial the case of ft juryman is directly in point It
is said that Mellor's right to challenge was presumably

[Page 450]

prejudiced because he may have desired to challenge the name
of William Thorniley but not that of Joseph Henry Thorne and may' have known
neither of them personally, and so in the case of a jury man the prisoner might
have had cause of challenge against Robert Currie and thus the prisoner might
have had his right of challenge curtailed if he knew neither of the men personally—the
trial, however, was held valid by all the judges.

Willes J, as to
the construction of the statute con curred in the judgment
of the Lord. Chief Baron Pollock, and in th.review of the
cases relied upon by the prisoner he concurred with the judgment of Erie J. and
he adds:

If a foreigner had been on the jury unknown to the prisoner
the conviction would have been unobjectionable even though the prisoner were
proved to have disliked foreigners, and to be sure to have challenged one if he
knew to him to be so: citing Rtx v. Sutton (1). Again, if the
juryman had been described on the panel by a wrong Christian name and had been
called merely in court and sworn upon the jury the conviction would have been
valid. Yet such a mistake might, equally with that in question, have misled the
prisoner and prevented him from challenging.

And again:

If this was a mistrial, the prisoner having been convicted, it
would equally have been a mis-trial in case of acquittal; but to order a venire
de novo in the latter case would be scandalous
and oppressive. It is not suggested that the prisoner has not had a fair trial
nor that he has sustained any prejudice. Far from its appearing that he was
deprived of his challenge it is even consistent with the facts that he may have
known who was about to be sworn and advisedly abstained from objecting to him.

Channell B. was of opinion that there was no mistrial and he
concurred in the opinion of Erie J. and in the reasons upon which that opinion
was formed—and he adds that he was unable to distinguish the case from the case
of a juryman upheld and supported as he con sidered it was by Hill v. Yates
(1). He says:—

The case of a injury man was the case of a capital felony. Bill
v. Yates was a civil action but it is clear from the report that the court
in the last case had in its mind criminal as well as civil cases and that the
objection was considered with reference to both classes of cases. I conclude
that in the case of Hill v. Yates, in
the year 1810,

[Page 451]

the then 12 judges fully
recognized and sanctioned the opinion of
the 12 judges their predecessors in the case of a juryman come to 27 years before.
With great deference to the Lord Chief Justice, I cannot bring myself to doubt
that the subject was in these cases fully considered, or that they are to be
treated otherwise than cogent authorities upon the question now before us.
Assuming that there has been an irregularity or a mistrial, it seems to me the
objection would only be ground of error.

As to the jurisdiction of the court under the statute to
entertain the question, he says:—

By the statute referred to, the court is empowered with
respect to questions of law reserved to hear and finally determine the same and
therefore to reverse, affirm or amend any judgment, or to avoid such judgment
and order an entry to be made that the party ought not to have been convicted,
or to arrest the judgment or order judgment to be given at some other session
of Oyer and Terminer if no judgment shall have been previously given, or to make
such other order as justice may require; it seems to me that the statute
contern.'' plates a final decision of the case without any ulterior proceedings
except such as may be necessary to give effect to the judgment of this court,
and that it did not contemplate or authorize any proceedings in the shape of a venire
de novo or in the nature of a new trial.

He did not, he said, attach much weight to the objection as to
the time at which the discovery of the alleged irregularity was made; and to
the consequent objection that the question raised was not
reserved at the trial

Byles J., while expressing no opinion upon the cou
struction of the statute beyond expressing considerable doubt whether it
authorized the court to grant a venire de novo, entertained
a clear opinion that the irregularity complained of did not constitute a
mis-trial.

It is, he said, an old and rational rule of law that where the parties to a transaction or the subject of a transaction are
actually corporeally present, the calling of either of them by a wrong name is
immaterial, presentia corporis tollit erroreut nômiinis* In this case there was, as soon as the
prisoner omitted the challenge and thereby in effect said "" I do not
object to the man standing there "" a compact between the crown and the
prisoner that the individual juryman there standing corporeally present should
try the case

And again:

A mere possibility of prejudice cannot vitiate the trial the
casa in 

[Page 452]

the note of Hill v. Yates (1)
seems to me to confirm this view and to be a solemn decision by all the
judges seventy five years ago, that notwithstanding some earlier cases a
mistake of this nature is no mistrial. If another rule is once introduced, new
trials in criminal eases will come in like a flood.

In Rég v. Feove (1) the learned judge who pronounced the
judgment of the majority of the court seems to have been of opinion that the
ground upon which the majority of the court in Mellor's case rested their
judgment that the question there raised was not
a question of law which arose at the trial was that the question was not
raised until after sentence had been passed; for he says that this point did
not arise in Reg v. Feore (2) for the reason that in that case the question was raised before the end of the trial,
that is before sentence and here he treats the trial as not
ended by the verdict But from the extracts above quoted from the judgments
delivered by the learned judges in Mellor's Case (1) it is apparent that
none of them rested his judgment upon any such ground. The grounds upon which
they proceeded as most clearly and emphatically ex pressed by them were: That
the jurisdiction of the court was limited by the statute to questions of law
arising upon the trial, either out of matter appearing upon the record or in the
evidence brought to the judge’s notice during the trial which question of law
the judge might himself have judicially determined finally, or might in his
discretion reserve for the consideration of the court instead of determining it
him self that the statute does not apply when the judgment of the court upon
the question submitted by the judge who tried the case would not finally
dispose of the case or where anything remained to be done beyond giving effect
to such final decision; that after verdict the judge fore whom the case had
been tried had no jurisdiction or authority whatever to collect

[Page 453]

material——that is to receive information in any manner of any matters alleged to be
facts, upon which as established facts to make a statement for the purpose of
submitting thereon a question of law—that the statute does not point to any
power in any body to try the prisoner again, or empower the court to dispose of
any matters not judicially ascertained to be facts, or directly or by
implication deprive the crown of the right and opportunity it would have upon a
writ of error to aver and prove that the allegations upon which the contention
that there had been a mis-trial was rested were not founded on fact, or to
displace the effect of such allegations, if true, by submitting to judicial
inquiry other facts pleaded—as for example that the prisoner had not been
deprived of an opportunity to challenge the juryman of whose presence on the
jury he complains, for that in point of fact the prisoner knew the juryman
personally, and that he never intended or wished to challenge him, and that
upon the juryman being presented to him personally, the prisoner well knowing
him, voluntarily accepted him as ajuror upon his trial, and declined
challenging him that the statute gives no jurisdiction over a case of
mis-trial—none to alter a verdict—none to treat a verdict as a nullity or to
grant a new trial—either by means of a venire de novo
or otherwise that the authoritv conferred by the statute is confined to
judgments after conviction, which judgments may be affirmed, amended or
avoided, but that the affirmance amendment or avoidance must be a final
disposition of the case that the statute never contemplated substituting the
Court of Criminal Appeal for a Court of Error as to errors in fact—and that the
irregularity complained of if objectionable at all, was so only as error in
fact which could only be enquired of on a writ of error.

These were the grounds upon which the judgments

[Page 454]

of the majoritv of the learned judges Mellor's case proceeded, and not
as suggested in Beg v. Feore (1) that the question did not arise
upon the trial because of the objection not having been taken until after
sentence had been passed. Now in the case as submit ted by the learned judges
to the Court of Queen's Bench On its appeal side, which is the court for crown
cases reserved in the Province of Quebec, the learned judge says that after
verdict counsel for the prisoner moved in arrest of judgment not upon any
matter appearing on the record but stated in an affidavitt or affidavits, and
that the verdict rendered against the prisoner should be set aside and
annulled, and that the prisoner if not liberated and discharged should be
afforded a new trial upon the grounds stated in the affidavits. The learned
""judge further says that by affidavits and documents produced to the court
upon be half of the prisoner on the above motion and by the deputy of the
Attorney General certain facts were established which the learned judge states
to be as follows (1): 

Now as to this statement it is to be observed: 1st. that the matter complained of does not constitute
ground for arrest of judgment and therefore the learned judge could not upon
the ground suggested have entertained the motion in arrest of judgment.

2ndly. As a motion in arrest of judgment can be entertained only upon matter appearing
upon the record affidavits stating new matter not appearing upon the record
cannot be received upon such a motion; in so far, therefore, as arrest of
judgment was concerned the matter stated in the affidavits was not judicially
before the learned judge.

3rdly. The learned judge had no ""jurisdiction to grant a
new trial or to hear and determine the motion so far as it asked for the
discharge of the prisoner or

[Page 455]

for a new trial l the matter
stated in the affidavits therefore Was not
judicially before the learned judge
for any of the purposes for which the
motion was, made or, indeed, for any purpose, and here applies one of the
reasons so strongly pressed by the learned judges constituting the majority in Mellor's
Case (1):— that the learned judge could not reserve a question of law which
he could not himself have finally determined, or a question founded upon facts
which did not appear judicially before him upon the trial nor had he any
jurisdiction after verdict to collect material—or to receive information in any
manner of any matter alleged to be facts upon which, as if they had been
judicially established, he should submit a question of law to the court.

4thly. That the matters stated by the
learned judge to have been established by the affidavits and the documents
therein referred to were only cognizable in a court of error as error in fact,
and that there is nothing in the statute to deprive the crown of the right to
dispute the truth of such matters or to displace them, assuming them to be
true, by pleading that the prisoner had lost no challenge or opportunity of
challenge, for that he personally knew Moise Lamoureux and had no
intention or wish to challenge him, and that he was given an opportunity of
doing so which he knowingly and voluntarily declined to avail himself of; the
truth of which, as appears by the learned judge's statement assuming it to be
correct, could readily have been established.

In fact the case is almost
identical with the case of The Juryman (1) for Moise Lamoureux
was the person served with a summons to attend as a juryman during the court.
He was duly qualified. He was served with the summons by the sheriff at his
dwelling

[Page 456]

house situate
in the concession from which the
sheriff appears to have been summoning the jurors. ""We may assume without
prejudice, although it is not expressly stated in the case that the summons
with which he was served was addressed to Joseph Lamoreux, a fact which
probably Moise did not know, for he may not have been able
to read the summons, &c. The case then is simply this, that Moise
Lamoureux,. a qualified juryman was summoned by the sheriff to attend
the court as a juryman, and was placea upon the panel in, and answered to, the
name of Joseph, thus shewing a plain case of misnomer precisely, as appears to
me within the decision of the case of The Juryman (1). He was well known
personally to the prisoner, whether the latter knew his christian name or not.
It is plain therefore, from the statement of the learned judge that there was no mis-trial and that the prisoner . suffered no
prejudice whatever. Indeed, it seems highly probable from the manner in which
the motion was made and the form of the motion supported by affidavits that Moise's christian name was known to the prisoner or that at
least he was known not to be Joseph, to which name he answered, and that he was
accepted by the prisoner as a juror to sit upon his trial with the reserved
intention in the mind of the prisoner or of his friends in case of conviction
to have the motion made which was made; but however that may be, it appears to
me to be clear upon principle and the authority of Mellor's case that the court
of crown cases reserved had no jurisdiction to entertain the question, and that
it only could be raised upon a writ of error m fact; and
that, upon principle and the authority of The Case
of a Juryman ([2]),
there was no mis-trial.

I am clearly of opinion also that
the case comes precisely within sec. 246 of ch. 174 of the Revised Statutes

[Page 457]

which enacts that:

Judgment, after a verdict upon an indictment for any felony or
misdemeanor, shall not be stayed or reversed as for any misnomer of any of the
jurors, nor because any person has served upon the jury who was not returned by
the sheriff or other officer.

In Mellor's Case (2) the act 7th Geo. 4, ch. 64, sec.
21 from which the above sec. 246 of ch. 174 R. S. C. originallty
was taken did not apply because both Thorne and Thorniley were duly returned by
the sheriff and entered upon the panel in their own proper names respectively,
and the mistake there was that one an swered when the other was called but here
Moise Lamoureux who was summoned to attend was not entered
on the panel and he answered to the name of Joseph Lamoureux, who had not been
summoned but whose name was upon the panel and thus Moise who
was not returned by the sheriff served upon the jury the identical case
mentioned in the statute.

For the above reasons, I am of opinion that the appeal should
be dismissed,—the conviction affirmed and the case remitted.

Appeal dismissed.

Magistrate Royston Ng:
1
         
 On 8 November 2005, the accused pleaded guilty before me to the following charge (exh P1):
“You, Soh Sim Teck (Male) (22.01.1966) (NRIC No. S1735195H), are charged that you, on or about 07.01.2005, did abet one Anuar Bin Othman (NRIC No: S1806954G) by engaging in a conspiracy with him to make to the Controller of Work Permits of the Ministry of Manpower, a statement which you both knew to be false in material particular; to wit, you agreed with the said Anuar Bin Othman to apply for  awork permit in respect of one Yuniar Ismail (PPT No.: AH032569) for her to be employed by one Anuar Bin Othman as a Domestic Worker at his residence at Blk 688B, Woodlands Drive 75, #15-26, Singapore 732688, and a work permit application form containing a statement representing that the said Anuar Bin Othman would be her employer, was submitted to the Controller of Work Permits, when you both knew that she would not be employed by the said Anuar Bin Othman in such a capacity, and which offence was committed in consequence of your abetment and you have thereby committed an offence under section 22(1)(d) read with Section 23(1) of the Employment of Foreign Workers Act, Chapter 91A and punishable under Section 22(1) of the same Act.”
2          I convicted the accused and imposed a fine of $2,000 in default 4 weeks’ imprisonment. The prosecution has appealed against the sentence imposed and I set out the grounds of my decision accordingly.
Brief facts
3          The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (exh P2) without qualification, having understood the consequences and the nature of his plea of guilt.
4          The accused is the licensee of Amsco Personnel Pte Ltd, an employment agency. On or about 7 January 2005, the accused requested one Anuar bin Othman (“Anuar”) to apply for a work permit to allow one Yuniar Ismail (“the maid”) to work at Anuar’s residence. Anuar agreed to the accused’s request.
5          The maid was subsequently granted a work permit on 26 January 2005 to be employed as a domestic worker by Anuar. However, she did not work for Anuar at his residence, but was instead provided accommodation by the accused at his own house, or that of his staff.
6          Both the accused and Anuar knew that the application would be fraudulent as there was never any intention for Anuar to employ the maid. Instead, Anuar would be paid the sum of $50 for the use of his name in the work permit application.
7          The accused had made the above arrangements in order to facilitate the maid’s arrival in Singapore for the purpose of selection by potential employers of domestic workers at his employment agency.
Antecedents, mitigation and submissions
8          The accused was a first offender. In mitigation, the accused pleaded for leniency. The prosecution declined to make any submissions on sentence.
Factors considered
9          The usual tariff for an offence under section 22(1)(d) of the Employment of Foreign Workers Act, for making a false declaration to the Controller of Work Permits, is a fine of $2,000.
10        However, this tariff cannot be carelessly applied and without any regard for the circumstances under which the offence was committed. In assessing the appropriate sentence to be imposed in a case under section 182 of the Penal Code, for making a false statement to a public servant, the learned Chief Justice stated in 
CLB & Anor v PP
 
[1993] 1 SLR 598
 (at 601F):
“The normal sentence imposed for an ordinary offence under s 182 of the Penal Code where the person to be sentenced is a first time offender is a fine of up to $1,000. However, s 182 covers an extensive array of misinformation of greatly varying degrees of iniquity and the norm must be varied according to the circumstances of each case, in particular the mischief that might be caused by the false information.”
11        In the present case, although it was true that the accused had misrepresented the state of employment of the maid, it was not suggested nor could it be said that the accused was a supplier of illegal workers.
12        To the contrary, the prosecution posited in the Statement of Facts that the accused had made the arrangement in order to “facilitate the foreigner’s arrival in Singapore for the purposes of selection by potential employers of domestic workers at his employment agency” (paragraph 4 of the Statement of Facts).  In other words, the arrangement the accused made with Anuar was presumably a transitional one until an employer for the maid could be found, and a transfer from Anuar to the new employer could be effected, validating the maid’s employment status.
13        I further noted that any profit to be made from the arrangement by the accused was indirect i.e. the advantage gained by the accused was that potential customers would be able to interview the maid in person at his agency, and not simply rely on non-interactive materials such as bio-data or video recordings. The arrangement made by the accused would therefore ostensibly offer the maid a better prospect for employment, upon which event would consequently translate into agency fees for the accused.
14        There was no suggestion by the prosecution that the accused had intended to employ the domestic worker outside of her proposed job scope, nor was the maid mistreated in any fashion.
15        Finally, I took into account the fact that the accused was a first offender who pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity, and offered no excuse whatsoever for his actions.
16        Under the circumstances, given the minimal mischief caused and the absence of any serious aggravating factors, I found no reason to depart from the usual tariff and thus imposed a fine of $2,000 in default 4 weeks’ imprisonment.",2005-12-13 00:00:00,SG Magistrates' Court

29 November 2005                                                                                               
 
Magistrate May Lucia Mesenas:
1
         
 On 11 November 2005, the Accused pleaded guilty to one charge of voluntarily causing hurt under section 323 of the Penal Code Cap 224. The charge is set out below:
Charge – Exhibit “P1”
“You, Chew Kwee Mui, female/40 years, NRIC No. S1715578D, are charged that you on 1
st
 day of July 2005 at or about 7.30pm, at No.1Elias Green, #02-03, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Efi Nuraeni, to wit, by slapping her on the cheek, pulling her hair and hitting her with a plastic cloth hanger on the face, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 323 of the Penal Code, Cap 224.
Statement of Facts
2          The Accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (
Exhibit ‘A’
) pertaining to the above charge, without qualification. The salient points are as follows:
(a) On 13 June 2005, the victim, Efi Nuraeni, came to Singapore to work as a domestic maid. At the material time, the accused is one of the two partners of the maid agency “Domestic Help Point”;
(b) On 30 June 2005, the victim was brought back to the accused’s home at No. 1 Elias Green, #02-03, for training;
(c) On 1 July 2005 at about 7.30pm, the victim informed the accused that she wanted to stay with another agent. Upon hearing this, the accused became angry and gave the victim a slap on the cheek, pulled her hair and also hit her face with a plastic cloth hanger. 
Antecedents and Mitigation
3          The Accused is a first offender for such offences. Her last conviction was on 27 August 1983 for a theft offence under section 380 of the Penal Code Cap 224 for which she was sentenced to a fine of $300 and one day imprisonment. The following mitigating factors are highlighted below:
(a)        The accused is a divorcee and has three children;
(b)        She is holding onto three jobs and taking care of her mother;
(c)        In the event that a custodial sentence is imposed, there will be no one to look after them.
Prosecution’s submission on sentence
4          The Prosecuting Officer, Inspector Alaudeen informed the court that the prosecution does not view the present matter as a maid abuse case. Consequently, section 73 of the Penal Code Cap 224 was not invoked as the accused was not the employer of the maid at the material time and hence the enhanced punishment of ‘one and a half times the amount of punishment’ to which the accused would otherwise have been liable was not applicable in this case.  The punishment prescribed for section 323 of the Penal Code Cap 224, simpliciter, would therefore be a maximum imprisonment term of up to one year or to a maximum fine of up to $1,000 or to both. Furthermore, the prosecution had submitted that it was not pressing for a custodial sentence.
Sentencing Considerations 
5          The prosecution did not invoke section 73(2) of the Penal Code Cap 224 as the facts of the case did not satisfy the criteria under section 73(1) of the Penal Code where such enhanced punishment is applicable to ‘an employer of a domestic maid or a member of the employer’s household’. In the present case, the accused was not the employer of the victim at the material time but, in fact, the maid agent for which the victim was undergoing training. Notwithstanding that the enhanced punishment may not be applicable to the accused, I was nonetheless mindful of the fact that the victim falls in the category of vulnerable victims for which section 73(2) of the Penal Code Cap 224 was aimed to protect. In addition, I was mindful of the accused’s position vis-à-vis the victim, in that the accused, being the maid agent, was in a position of authority even though she was not the direct employer of the maid. For maid abuse cases prosecuted under section 323 read with section 73(2) of the Penal Code Cap 224, the courts have taken a serious view on such matters and have imposed custodial sentences: 
PP v Chong Siew Chin
 
[2002] 1 SLR 117
, 
Ong Ting Ting v PP
 
[2004] 4 SLR 53
.
6          However, I also took into account the following mitigating factors that the  accused was a first offender for such offences and was remorseful in her demeanour. Furthermore, the injuries, if at all, were minor as submitted by the prosecution. There was no medical report tendered by the prosecution to confirm the same either. The prosecution also did not press for a custodial sentence and neither were there any aggravating circumstances which were brought to the attention to this court save for what was stated in the Statement of Facts.
7          Notwithstanding that the injuries were minor, and that the true extent of the victim’s injuries were not before the court in the absence of a medical report, I was also mindful that the accused had used a plastic cloth hanger to hit the victim’s face (which is a vulnerable part of the body), in addition to pulling her hair. However, there was no evidence that the abuse occurred over a prolonged period or that it occurred on more than one occasion, which would be aggravating. It appears from the statement of facts that it was an one-off incident where the accused possibly acted on the spur of the moment. Afterall, she was holding three jobs at the material time (which was undisputed), and the stress of juggling work together with taking care of three children and an aged parent, would have put a tremendous amount of stress on the accused at the material time.
8             Having considered all the factors, I am of the view that a fine would be appropriate and accordingly, I sentenced her to the maximum fine of $1,000 in default two weeks’ imprisonment.
9          Dissatisfied with the sentence of a fine only, the prosecution lodged a Notice of Appeal on 17  November 2005. The fine has since been fully paid up by the accused.",2005-11-29 00:00:00,SG Magistrates' Court

11 November 2005
 
District Judge Tan May Tee:
Background
1          On 12 November 1999, the Plaintiff was injured whilst commuting to her workplace.  She had, like many office workers in Singapore used public transport during the morning peak hours.  She was crossing Bras Basah Road from the Swisshotel or Westin Stamford as it was then known where the City Hall MRT station is also situated and in order to get to her workplace at the Marina Centre vicinity she would then board a shuttle bus provided by Marina Properties Pte Ltd.  This was apparently a free bus service provided by the building owners for convenience of the workers.  At the material time, the Plaintiff was working at Centennial Tower on Temasek Avenue in the Marina Centre and Suntec City vicinity.  She was crossing the road to board the shuttle bus operated by the Defendants when she fell as a result of a collision with the bus and suffered several injuries.   The Plaintiff issued the writ in this suit on 6 September 2002 almost three years from the accident on 12 November 1999.   
2          The action came before me for trial solely on the issue of liability.  After hearing the witnesses and reading the written submissions filed by counsel, I entered judgment for the Defendants.  The Plaintiff has filed an appeal in person and her solicitors have since the judgment sought an order discharging them from further acting for her.  I now provide my reasons for dismissing her claim.
Pleadings
3          The Plaintiff pleaded in her Statement of Claim that on or about 12 November 1999 at about 9 am, she was crossing Bras Basah Road from the former Westin Stamford Hotel towards the pickup point near Raffles Hotel when she was hit by bus No. PZ 1200G owned by the Defendants and driven by one Ong Boon Tak, the Defendants’ employee.   The said bus was stationary on the bus lane just outside the Raffles Hotel premises when the Plaintiff crossed the road.  The Plaintiff was in front
 
of the bus when it suddenly moved forward and collided into her.  The Plaintiff suffered injuries as a result of the collision which she alleged was due to the negligence of the Defendants’ servant or agent in the driving, use and management of the said bus.  Particulars of their negligence as alleged are set out below:
a)         Failing to keep any or any proper lookout while driving PZ 1200G;
b)         Failing to observe the presence of the Plaintiff on the road;
c)         Failing to stop in time to prevent the collision with the Plaintiff;
d)         Failing to exercise reasonable care, skill and prudence in the driving, use and management of the said bus;
e)         Failing to slow down, swerve or stop so as to manage and control         in such a way to avoid the said accident.
4          The Defendants denied the negligence alleged and in their Defence pleaded that “whilst crossing the road the Plaintiff pedestrian fell and knocked into the stationary motor bus PZ 1200G”.  They further pleaded that the Plaintiff’s injuries, which were not admitted, were caused solely or contributed  to by the Plaintiff’s own negligence in particular 
inter alia -
a)         failing to keep any or any proper lookout or to have any or any sufficient regard for her own safety when crossing or attempting to cross the said road;
b)         crossing or attempting to cross the road in an unsafe and dangerous manner;
c)         dashing across the road, losing her balance, fell and knocked into the stationary motor bus;
d)         failing to notice the motorbus in sufficient time or at all to avoid the said accident;
e)         failing to comply and adhere to the provision of the Highway Code on crossing a street at a marked pedestrian crossing;
f)          failing to use the pedestrian crossing or to cross the road at the controlled traffic junction; and
g)         failing to ensure her own safety by paying sufficient attention and keeping a proper lookout in any other way so as to avoid the accident.
Issue at trial and onus on Plaintiff
5          At the trial of this Plaintiff’s action before me, the issue to be determined was whether the Defendants were liable in negligence for the accident.  The primary question of fact which arose from the pleadings was – did the Defendants’ bus collide into the Plaintiff or was it the Plaintiff who knocked into the bus?  To succeed in her claim, the onus was on the Plaintiff to prove on a balance of probabilities that the Defendants’ bus had moved forward and collided into her due to the negligence of their driver.
The evidence
6.         The Plaintiff called two witnesses – herself and the Traffic Police Investigating Officer in charge of the case.  The Defendants also called two witnesses – the driver of the bus PZ1200G and a security guard engaged by Marina Properties Pte Ltd. who was present at the scene on the day of the accident and had witnessed the accident.
PW-1 : SSI Ong Tian Heng from Traffic Police
7          PW-1 informed the Court that in the course of his investigations he had interviewed three witnesses other than the parties involved in the accident.   Under cross-examination, the following was recorded (see Notes of Evidence page 8)
Q:         You said 3 witnesses interviewed, 2 gave accounts.  Did witnesses confirm that Defendants’ bus was stationary & did not move at all and knock into Plaintiff?
A:         2 of the 3 witnesses confirmed that the bus was stationary when the accident took place, whereas the other witness did not see how the accident happened but merely stopped to help.
8          At the conclusion of PW-1’s investigation, he had issued a letter of warning to the Plaintiff on 29 January 2000 for her failure to use the designated pedestrian crossing at the traffic light junction.  No action was, however, taken against the Defendants’ bus driver. 
DW-1 : Singaraja s/o Rasiah, security guard on duty
9          Counsel for Plaintiff had applied for the evidence of this witness who had actually been called by the Defendants to be adduced before he closed his client’s case.  Though out of the norm, I granted the application there being no objection from the Defendants.
10        In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (AEIC), DW-1 had stated that:
‘3.        At the time of the accident I was standing in front of the bus no. PZ 1200 and I was counting the number of persons who had boarded the bus.  The passengers actually should cross the road at the traffic light junction, but most of them took a shortcut.  My duty was to ensure that when the bus was full I gave the signal to the driver to proceed.
4.         I confirm that I was standing in front of the bus and I saw the lady pedestrian, who I am now informed is the plaintiff, crossed the road towards Raffles Hotel Pick-up point.  I noted that the bus no. PZ 1200 driven by the defendant was stationary at the material time.  The plaintiff was looking to her left hand side for vehicles which may have turned Bras Basah Road and she fell and knocked into the stationary bus.  Another passenger by the name of Eng Meng Chia saw the incident as well and was willing to give evidence.  I do not know where he is now…’
5.         After the Plaintiff fell, a few pedestrians crossing the road, the bus driver and I went to assist her.  She got up by herself and went into the bus and there were no visible injuries.
6.         I am now shown the police report of Soh Bee Hoon, the Plaintiff.  I confirm that the bus was stationary at all times and did not move and knock into her.
7.         I remember that the investigating officer from the traffic police did call me and I attended traffic police department and gave a statement to the investigating officer and confirmed that the bus no. PZ 1200 driven by the Defendant was stationary.
8.         I do not know the Defendant driver of motor bus PZ 1200 personally.”
11        DW-1 exhibited in his affidavit a copy of his statement to his then employers, Marina Properties Pte Ltd, which had been made on the day of the accident.  The contents of the statement made almost contemporaneously albeit in rather bad English essentially mirrored the account in his AEIC in that he confirmed that the Plaintiff had knocked into the parked bus which was waiting to pick up passengers.  DW-1 also confirmed on the witness stand that the bus was stationary at all times and did not move and collide into the Plaintiff. 
12        Under cross-examination by Mr Jee, counsel for Plaintiff, DW-1’s evidence was not in the least shaken.  He said that
 
[note: 1]
he was standing near the front door of the bus where he could see people crossing opposite of him and when they came from the right-hand side.  He could remember the time around 9.05 am.  The bus PZ 1200 was standing in front of Raffles Hotel, a few of the pedestrians were crossing the road illegally, one of them a lady (presumably the Plaintiff) also crossing, she was looking at her left hand side because the traffic light had  turned to green; she was wearing high heel shoes, she was rushing to the bus, concerned for the oncoming traffic, she came and ‘knocked the bus’.  She had been looking to her left for oncoming cars after the traffic lights turned green.  She was walking very fast and she came and knocked onto the driver’s side of the bus.  She knocked onto the front of the bus and she fell.  He was able to demonstrate the manner in which the Plaintiff had knocked into the bus and to explain what happened subsequently.  By the demonstration given, I understood the word “knocked” used by DW-1 to mean that the Plaintiff had collided or run into the front of the bus.
13        When counsel put to DW1 that since he had to watch out for oncoming buses, traffic lights, do head count and watch out for pedestrians crossing Bras Basah Road, he therefore did not witness the accident as he had recounted, DW1 firmly disagreed.  Under re-examination
[note: 2]
, he reiterated that the bus was stationary, it was parked there and he was “100% sure that it was parked there.”  He went on to state that if the bus had moved just one foot, the Plaintiff would have “got smashed on the front tyre.” 
PW-2 : Soh Bee Hoon 
14        The Plaintiff’s account from her AEIC was as follows:
2.         On the 12
th
 day of November 1999 at about 9.00 am, I was crossing Bras Basah Road from Swisshotel, formerly known as the Westin Stamford Hotel towards the pick-up point near Raffles Hotel when I was collided into by motor bus No. PZ 1200G driven by one Ong Boon Tak, an employee of the Defendants.
3.         At the material time, the said bus was stationary on the bus lane along Bras Basah Road just outside Raffles Hotel premises waiting to pick passenger up when I crossed Bras Basah Road from Swisshotel.  The said bus was picking up passengers at the pick-up point and thereafter to ferry those passengers to Marina and Suntec City area.
4.         I was crossing Bras Basah Road and when I was in front of the said bus, the said bus suddenly moved forward and collided into me on my left.  The impact caused me to fall heavily on my buttocks and I felt excruciating pain around my chest and buttock areas with fainting spells. I was flung heavily to the ground.  I felt so weak and hardly able to talk.  I asked the bus driver for his particulars.  He refused to give to me unless I board the bus.  I boarded the bus and asked the Defendant for his particulars.  He was unable to produce his driving licence and told me that he is a Malaysian.
15        In her police report which was filed on the day of the accident itself and exhibited in her AEIC, the Plaintiff had stated the following:
“On 12 November 1999 at 9.10 am I was crossing from outside Westin Hotel to Raffles Hotel (across Bras Basah Road) where the Shuttle Service Bus of Marina Properties Pte Ltd (Tel 3369788) Bus was waiting to pick passengers.  The bus was stationary waiting for passengers to cross like normal days.  I walked towards the bus about 2 feet away moving around to mount the bus but as I was moving in front of it, suddenly it moved forward.  I was hit on the face and left side of the body.  The impact threw me off and I fell flat on my buttocks.  The pain was searing and I felt fainting.  One guy – Danny 95248132 (Pgr) quickly shouted at the driver to stop the car and he quickly picked me up.  I was driven to Millenia Tower and an ambulance was called to drive me to Singapore General Hospital.  I’m hurt on my right buttock badly and my palm show scratches and swelling.  He is a Malaysian – Ong Boon Tak – 610726-04-5389 employed by Marina Properties and did not show driving licence - Pgr 95761910.”  
16        Under cross-examination by Mr Fazal, the Plaintiff disagreed that the security guard DW1 was standing in front of the bus and looking at the pedestrians crossing the road.  She claimed that DW-1 had to stand away from the pedestrian area, from the front of the bus and would be looking behind the bus instead

.  When pressed for an explanation why the bus would have moved suddenly as she claimed when it had every reason to be stationary since it was waiting for passengers to board, the Plaintiff stated that it had to move forward if there was an oncoming bus from behind.  She appeared to have tailored this part of her evidence to that of DW-1 who had informed the court earlier that his task of making sure the buses did not cause obstruction would be to wave the buses on if there were too many waiting in line.  She also disagreed that DW-1 was the first person to go forward to help her up.  She said that no one was on the bus at the time it knocked into her.  She maintained her story that the bus had suddenly moved forward and hit her despite the Traffic Police’s investigation that had confirmed from two other witnesses the fact of the bus being stationary at the material time.
17        The Plaintiff claimed that after the impact, she was sitting on the floor in a lot of pain and in a fainting spell.  One man by the name of Danny had come to help her.  He was the one who waved to the driver to stop the bus.  He was apparently a Polytechnic student.  Both of them were close together and he was next to her.  At that time, both of them were some four feet away from the bus in front of the driver who was looking down at them
[note: 4]
.  Unfortunately for the Plaintiff, Danny had told Traffic Police that he had not witnessed the accident.
DW-2, Ong Boon Tak, bus driver
18        In his AEIC, the bus driver stated as follows:
‘6.        I had stopped motor bus PZ 1200 to let passengers board my bus.  A person told me a lady run into my stationary bus.  She was not using any pedestrian crossing.  I went down and checked.  I helped her to her feet.  She boarded my bus.  She asked for my particulars and that of the security guard.  I gave her my particulars.  I then dropped the passengers at DFS Building.  I did not see any injuries on her and one Mr Raja witnessed the accident...’
19        The bus driver had not seen how the accident happened.  Someone told him that a lady had run into his stationary bus.  He did not hear any sound. 
 
[note: 5]
Under cross-examination he stated that he had stopped or parked his bus and was waiting for passengers to board.  When the security guard gestured for him to move off then he would go off.   He denied the suggestion from Plaintiff’s counsel that in a lapse of concentration while waiting for passengers to board his bus, he had moved the bus suddenly forward and hit the plaintiff.  He also denied that the Plaintiff looked like she was in pain after the accident.  He testified that the Plaintiff was able to get up and able to board his bus.  After the Plaintiff had boarded his bus, he waited for the security guard to signal to him before driving off. 
Assessment of the evidence and findings
20        I found the Plaintiff’s testimony quite difficult to believe.  She testified that the bus which was stationary on the bus lane and waiting to pick up passengers had in fact moved forward.  It then hit her with an impact great enough for her to be flung heavily to the ground, yet she was able to board the very same bus and ride on it all the way to her workplace.  In my view, had the Defendants’ stationary bus started to accelerate and moved forward, its sheer momentum would have caused it to move a distance before coming to a standstill.  The impact of the moving bus notwithstanding at a slow speed would surely have caused more extensive injuries than what she had sustained.  As graphically described by DW-1, the Plaintiff would have been ‘smashed’.  The Plaintiff attempted to explain that the bus had moved forward to make way for the buses coming from behind.   No evidence was, however, led by the Plaintiff on the number of buses lining up at the pick-up point which would have lent credence to her contention that bus PZ1200 was moving off to make away for the buses behind it. 
21        In her police report made on the same day as the accident, the Plaintiff had recounted being hit on the face and left side of the body.  However, neither DW-1 nor DW-2 saw any visible injuries on her and it was common ground that she had managed to board the bus without any difficulty.   Further, although she had spoken to the bus driver DW-2 to ask for his particulars, it seemed incongruous that she had not queried the bus driver on why he had suddenly moved the bus when there were passengers about to board it. 
22        The Plaintiff came across as a rather evasive witness.  After saying that she had been taking the shuttle bus to her workplace over a period of time some months prior to the accident, when asked if she agreed that she would be familiar with the scene of the buses stopping there and picking up passengers, she told the court that she declined to answer
[note: 6]
.   She also contradicted the evidence of PW-1, the Traffic Police Investigating Officer whom she had called to testify for her, by claiming that he had told her the Defendants would receive a summons or be warned on account of the accident.   In his testimony, PW-1 had stated quite clearly that the only action taken by him after concluding his investigations was to issue a warning letter to the Plaintiff.  The Defendants’ driver was not subject to any prosecution nor even a warning letter.  Regretfully for the Plaintiff, PW-1’s evidence did not in any respect assist her case that the Defendants’ bus had moved forward and collided into her.  In fact, his evidence which was a summary of his investigations corroborated the Defendants’ version that the Plaintiff was the one who knocked into the bus.  The Plaintiff had not submitted that PW-1’s testimony was in any way unreliable and should be rejected.
23        The evidence adduced from the Defendants’ witnesses, in particular  DW-1, was on opposite poles to the Plaintiff’s testimony that DW-2 had driven the bus and collided into her.  DW-1’s recount of the accident was clear and unequivocal despite his broken English.  The bus was stationary and waiting for his signal before it moved off.  He had seen with his own eyes the Plaintiff rushing to the bus with her head turned away.  She had knocked into the bus and fallen.  She then got up and boarded the bus which took her to her office building.   Having observed DW-1’s demeanour on the witness stand, I found his testimony to be credible and forthright and there was no ground to discredit him.  His evidence was for the most part unassailable by the Plaintiff despite counsel’s feeble attempt to challenge him on the basis that he could not have observed how  the accident happened since he was occupied with many other tasks at the material time.    
24        Although there were some inconsistencies between the evidence of  DW-1 and DW-2, I did not consider them to be so material as to disregard their testimonies altogether.  The discrepancies related to the number of passengers on the bus at the time of the accident and the time that the Plaintiff was sitting on the road after her fall.  What was crucial and that both defence witnesses corroborated was that – the bus was waiting for passengers, DW-2, the bus driver, relied on the hand gestures or signals to be given by DW-1, the security guard, before he would move on.  There was no evidence to suggest that this did not take place at the material time.   Both also testified that DW-2 had come down the bus to give the Plaintiff assistance, there were no injuries seen on her and she was able to go up the bus. 
25        There was no relationship between the employers of DW-1 and DW-2 to suggest that one would cover up for the other.  In fact, at the trial DW-1 disclosed that he was no longer employed by Marina Properties Pte Ltd so there would be no reason for him to testify in such a manner to help DW-2, the Defendants or his former employers.  It was also not put to him that his testimony was in any way biased or that he had any personal gain by testifying for the Defendants.  His version was also supported by a contemporaneous document, the report which had been given to his employer on the day of the incident.  In my view, DW-1 was an independent and a credible eye-witness to the incident on the morning of 12 November 1999. 
26        The Traffic Police had interviewed one other witness, Eng Meng Chia, but he had not been called by either party to testify at the trial.  It is noteworthy that upon conclusion of their investigations, given the seriousness of the Plaintiff’s alleged injuries, the only action taken by Traffic Police was to issue the Plaintiff with a letter of warning for jaywalking.
27.       The Plaintiff gave a version which was not corroborated by her own witness, the Investigating Officer from Traffic Police.  She had named a witness in her police report but failed to secure his testimony in court.  In his closing submissions, Mr Jee had attempted to rely on the medical reports of the Plaintiff to link her injuries to her account of the accident.   I declined to refer to these reports as they had not been admitted for the trial on liability before me and would in any event be of no relevance as the account of the accident provided therein was given by the Plaintiff herself.  Such self-serving statements could not advance the Plaintiff’s case in any way.  I did, however, take into account the testimony of PW-1 who stated that the Plaintiff had reported to him that she suffered a bad bruise on the right side of her buttocks.  Such an injury would, in my view, be equally consistent with the Plaintiff having knocked or collided into the bus and falling heavily on her bottom. 
28        On the evidence adduced by both parties, I had no other option but to find that the Defendants’ bus had remained in a stationary position at the material time and it was the Plaintiff who in her hurry to get across the road had collided into the Defendants’ bus. 
Conclusion
29        In civil proceedings, the onus is on the plaintiff to prove her case.  The Plaintiff had failed to discharge her burden of proof in this case.  The Plaintiff had not been able to show on a balance of probabilities that the Defendants’ employee had acted negligently by causing the bus to move forward from its stationary position and colliding into her and causing her injuries.  Based on my assessment of the evidence, it was the Defendants’ version that was more probable.  The Plaintiff’s claim was accordingly dismissed with costs.

25 November 2005
 
District Judge Valerie Thean:
The charges
1.        
 
The accused, Lim Hwee Ling Rina, pleaded guilty to 13 charges in respect of various Penal Code offences.  These were one charge under s 406, 6 charges under s 468 and 6 charges under s 420.
2.         The charges concerned two series of offences.  12 of the charges the accused pleaded guilty to were in respect of the first series.  DAC 23743/05, the s 406 charge, read as follows:
You, Lim Hwee Ling Rina are charged that you, on or about the 6
th
 day of June 2002 in Singapore committed breach of trust, in that you, being entrusted with property, to wit, cash of S$180,000 belonging to Lim Chee Seng, dishonestly misappropriated the said property, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 406 of the Penal Code, Cap 224.
3.         Three of the s 468 charges related to forgery of bank account statements for the purpose of cheating.  DAC 44675/05 was as follows:
You, Lim Hwee Ling Rina, are charged that you sometime in March 2005, in Singapore, did fraudulently forge a document, to wit, a UOB Bank ‘I Account’ Statement dated between 1 February 2005 to 28 February 2005, bearing the name of account holder Lim Chee Seng and Account number 402-308-367-6, showing a balance of $546,446.06 on the said account with the intention of causing it to be believed that such document was issued by UOB Bank, and intending that it be used for the purpose of cheating, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 468 of the Penal Code, Cap 224.
DAC 44676/05 and 44677/05 were two similar charges involving her forgery of two further bank statements in April and May 2005.
4.         Four of the s 468 charges were in respect of forgery of cheques for the purpose of cheating.  DAC 44700/05 was as follows:
You, Lim Hwee Ling Rina, are charged that you, on the 10
th
 day of September 2002, did forge a document, to wit, a Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation cash cheque bearing serial number 120662 for $350,000, purportedly issued by Lim Chee Seng, intending that it be used for the purpose of cheating Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation bank, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 468 of the Penal Code, Cap 224.
DAC 44680/05, 44714/05 and 44716/05 described incidents of forgery of other cheques for the amounts of $300,000, $300,000 and $200,000 respectively.
5.         Four of the charges brought under s 420 related to cheating UOB or OCBC, on the basis of the forged cheques, into delivering cash to the accused.  DAC 44701/05 read as follows:
You, Lim Hwee Ling Rina, are charged that you, on the 11
th
 day of September 2002, in Singapore, did cheat, to wit, by deceiving one United Overseas Bank teller, into believing that a United Overseas Bank cash cheque bearing number 120662 of account number 640-729298-001 dated 10
th
 September 2002 had been issued by drawer, Lim Chee Seng, which cheque you had forged, and in so doing you dishonestly induced the said Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation bank teller into delivering $350,000 cash to you, which she would not have done had she not been so deceived and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 420 of the Penal Code, Cap 224
DAC 44681/05, 44715/05 and 44717/05 similarly detailed incidents of cheating in the amounts of $300,000, $300,000 and $200,000 respectively.
6.         The last charge, DAC 44723/05, brought under s 420 of the Penal Code, was in respect of a separate conspiracy to cheat involving one Chang Yam Song, Louis, and read as follows:
You, Lim Hwee Ling Rina, are charged that you sometime in August 2002, in Singapore, did engage with one Chang Yam Song, Louis, in a conspiracy to do a certain thing, namely to cheat, and in pursuance of that conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing an act took place on the 20
th
 of August 2002, to wit, the said Chang Yam Song Louis did deceive one Oh Boon Wah Gary into believing that he could invest in a furniture trading business, which reaps a high profit, which representation you knew to be false, and by such manner of deception, you dishonestly induced the said Oh Boon Wah Gary to deliver to you a sum of $100,000 by way of a Maybank cheque bearing number 023662, an act he would not have done had he not been so deceived, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 420 read with s 109 of the Penal Code, Cap 224
Statement of Facts
7.         The accused admitted to the statement of facts without qualification.  The first series of these offences related to her management of two bank accounts of her grandfather, Lim Chee Seng.  For some ten years, she was entrusted with two of his accounts.  These were a United Overseas Bank account with about $500,000 and an Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation account with about $1.6 million.
8.         The facts relating to the criminal breach of trust concerned a cheque of $180,000 which Mr Lim entrusted to the accused on 6 June 2002 to encash and thereafter deposit into his OCBC account.  After withdrawing the sum of $180,000, the accused, instead of depositing the money into Mr Lim’s account, misappropriated the money to her own use.
9.         Four offences of forgery for the purposes of cheating and four offences of cheating were committed when the accused fraudulently withdrew funds from Mr Lim’s accounts.  On 18 September 2002, the accused made out a UOB cash cheque bearing number 050916 for the sum of $300,000 from Mr Lim’s UOB bank account.  Thereafter she forged his signature on the cheque, intending it to be used for the purposes of cheating UOB.  On 19 September she followed up by presenting the forged cheque to UOB, inducing the teller to process the transaction and hand over $300,000 in cash to her.  On 10 September the accused similarly forged a OCBC cash cheque for $350,000 and subsequently induced the teller at OCBC to deliver the $350,000 in cash to her.  On 5 August 2002 and 7 September 2002, Mr Lim signed OCBC cheques in advance and instructed the accused to insert the figures $300 and $200 respectively.  Instead, she wrote $300,000 and $200,000 respectively on the two cheques.  In each case she presented the cheque to the teller the same day, and obtained the amounts in cash.
10.       In order to cover her tracks, in March 2005 and twice again in April 2005, the accused committed three further offences of forgery for the purposes of cheating.  She forged UOB account statements in order to convince Mr Lim that the funds in his bank account were in order.
11.       The last offence proceeded with concerned separate facts.  In August 2002, the accused and her boyfriend, one Louis Chang Yam Song, conspired to cheat one Oh Boon Wah Gary.  It was falsely represented to Mr Oh that Mr Chang had a furniture business capable of high returns to potential investors.  This representation was not true.  In addition, they offered Mr Oh a $110,000 post dated cheque issued by the accused to act as a collateral for his investment.  Both knew that the cheque would not be honoured as the accused’s bank accounts had insufficient funds to pay the promised amount.  Premised on these false representations, Mr Oh handed over a sum of $100,000 by way of a Maybank cheque
Charges taken into consideration
12.       Ninety-six charges were taken into consideration.  74 charges under s 468 of the Penal Code and 16 charges under s 420 of the Penal Code concerned the first series of offences where Mr Lim was the victim.  The remainder 6 charges brought under s 420 of the Penal Code concerned the conspiracy together with Mr Chang to cheat six other persons.
Total amount taken
13.       The total amount taken from the various victims came to $2.677 million.
Mitigation
14.       The accused was a first offender and had assisted in police investigations.
15.       The mitigation plea explained that the accused’s misadventures started when she became involved romantically with Mr Chang, the father of her two children and her accomplice in seven of the charges.  After they started a relationship, she assisted him in his business, Cheetaz On The Move Pte Ltd, which had financing problems.  The money taken from Mr Lim was in aid of Mr Chang’s pressing debt problems.  Initially, the money was used to pay various creditors and salaries.  As their problems continued, they decided to use the funds to gamble in an attempt to win sufficient money to return to Mr Lim.  This failed, leading to the need for even more funds to be taken from Mr Lim.  During the same time period that money was being taken from Mr Lim’s accounts, Mr Chang and the accused also embarked on a scheme to cheat seven other persons.  Regarding these offences, it was explained that the accused’s role was minimal: Mr Chang cut the deal with the seven victims.  The money was used for Mr Chang’s company.  For these offences, Mr Chang made restitution of $175,000.
Reasons for sentence
16.       I considered favourably the fact that the accused was a first offender.  Her cooperation with the police and early plea of guilt were further mitigating factors.  In relation to the conspiracy offences, I took into account that the restitution made reduced some of the loss suffered by the respective victims.  At the same time, due regard had to be given to several factors that required a sentence that sufficiently reflected the public interest.  First, the number of charges were enormous: 13 were proceeded with and 96 taken into consideration, 109 charges in all.  Secondly, the amount in question was very substantial: $2.677 million.  Further, all but one of the charges were brought under s 468 and 420 of the Penal Code.  Sections 468 and 420 are punishable with imprisonment terms of 7 years, and the courts have always viewed these two offences with gravity: see 
Lee Aik Kian v PP
 
[2003] SGHC 58
 at [35] on s 468; 
Chua Kian Kok v PP
 
[1999] 2 SLR 542
 at [23] in respect of s 420.
17.       In 
Sivaperagas s/o Marimuthu v PP
, MA 188/95/01, the accused pleaded guilty to 5 charges brought under s 420 of the Penal Code, of conspiracy to cheat a finance company into believing that 5 hire purchase loans for the purported sale of computer sets were true, inducing the finance company to release the total sum of $912,938, of which $500,000 was owing.  The accused’s share was $45,000.  The district court imposed a total sentence of 6 years, which was upheld on appeal by the accused against his sentence.  The amount defrauded, charges and incidents involved in 
Sivaperagas
 were trivial in comparison to that of the accused in the present case.
18.       
PP v Lim Hoon Choo
 
[2000] 1 SLR 221
 is a forgery case which is more serious than the present.  There, the accused pleaded guilty to 12 charges under s 468.  470 other charges were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentence.  Through altering cheques, she obtained a total sum of $3.117 million.  Restitution of $250,000 was made.  She had two previous convictions involving criminal breach of trust, receiving 8 months’ imprisonment and then 24 months’ imprisonment.  On the prosecution’s appeal, her sentence was enhanced to 9 years’ imprisonment.
19.         In 
Cheong Siat Fong v PP
 
[2005] SGHC 176
, the learned Chief Justice stated when enhancing to 39 months’ imprisonment the sentence of a first-time offender on four counts of theft and forgery involving a much smaller sum of $39,379.12:
… I took into account the following when enhancing the appellant’s sentences.  First, the maximum terms of imprisonment were seven years for theft-in-dwelling and use of identity card without authority and ten years for forgery.  This reflected the seriousness with which Parliament viewed these offences.  Second, the theft and forgery were deliberate.  The evidence demonstrated that the appellant waited for an opportunity to steal the items in order to effect the withdrawal, and she practised signing the signature in order to perfect it.  Premeditation is an aggravating factor: PP v Tan Fook Sum 
[1999] 2 SLR 523
 at [28].  Third, the appellant was able to commit the offence by utilising a key to Chan’s apartment that she had in the first place because of Chan’s trust in her.  Intimate human relationships such as friendships are based, first and foremost, on trust.  An abuse of one’s position of trust and friendship should be taken seriously: see Andrew Ashworth, 
Sentencing and Penal Policy
 (Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1983) at p 94.  Fourth, the other ten withdrawals over a period of just four days in May 2003 of smaller amounts, followed by the large withdrawal on 23 June 2003, demonstrated how the accused was gradually emboldened by her earlier successes, as well as the systematic and premeditated manner in which the accused cheated her close and long-time friend.  Finally, the punishment should be proportional to the magnitude of the offence.  Here, the sum involved was not insignificant.
20.       In that case, the accused took advantage of his close friendship with the victim to gain access to the victim’s apartment.  Using an identity card and a blank cheque he found there, he forged bank documents to effect a withdrawal of $39,379.12 from the victim’s account.  The comments highlighted above are pertinent to the case at hand.   Here, the facts of the two separate series of offences did not weigh in the accused’s favour.  She siphoned money from an elderly and vulnerable victim, taking advantage of Mr Lim’s misplaced trust in their grandfather-granddaughter relationship and her position of sole responsibility for his accounts.  Not sated by her grandfather’s money, she embarked on a conspiracy with Mr Chang during the same time period to cheat others, offering cheques in her name as collateral when she knew these would not be honoured.  Counsel submitted that she derived no direct financial gain, but it would not be correct to say that she did not benefit from her crimes.  Her actions enabled her to forward her business interests at Cheetaz On the Move Pte Ltd and to continue her relationship and family life with Mr Chang.  The submission that she was hard-pressed by debt was also, in the present case, not an appropriate excuse for the disappearance of $2.677 million.  The purpose of the law is to maintain discipline, and is most necessary precisely where a citizen might be inclined to act to the prejudice of good order: see 
Lai Oei Mui Jenny v PP
 
[1993] 3 SLR 305
.
  Whilst she may have displayed a lack of judgment in her relationship with Mr Chang, she was fully aware of what she was doing and the loss that would be caused to all.  To restrain from applying the proper punishment for her actions would be to set an unhealthy precedent and to undermine the very premise of laws relating to offences against property.
21.       Taking into account all the facts and circumstances of the case, I decided that an aggregate total sentence of six-and-a-half years’ imprisonment was appropriate.
Conclusion
22.       On 2 November 2005, I sentenced the accused to two year terms for DAC 23743/05, 44675/05, 44676/05, 44677/05, 44716-7/05 and 44723/05.  For the offences involving sums of $300,000 and above, DAC 44680-1/05, 44700-1/05 and 44714-5, two and a half years was imposed.  DAC 23743/05, 44701/05 and 44723/05 were made consecutive, coming to the total term of six-and-a-half years imprisonment.  Her term was backdated to her first date of remand, 11 June 2005.
23.       On 11 November 2005, the accused filed an appeal in person.  She is at present serving sentence.",2005-11-25 00:00:00,SG District Court

Stall
Assistant when she was issued a work permit to be employed by you as a Domestic Worker and you have thereby committed an offence under section 5(3) of the Employment of Foreign Workers Act (Cap 91A) and punishable under Section 22(2) of the same Act.”
After a 3-days trial, I convicted the Accused and sentenced her to a fine of $4,000/=. The Accused, being dissatisfied, appealed against conviction and sentence. 
Background facts
2.           Ponirah Namaraja  (“Ponirah”), an Indonesian national, held the work permit  stated in the charge to work as a domestic worker in the Accused’s residence at Blk 360 Hougang Avenue 5 #10-330 Singapore 530360.  The work permit was initially for the period 21 June 2004 to 1 July 2004 and was then renewed for another term  15 July 2004 to 8 July 2006.  One of the conditions of these work permits which the Accused accepted and undertook was that Ponirah would perform only household/ domestic duties at the residential  address  stated in the work permit.
3.         On 25 September 2004, a team of Employment Inspectors from the Ministry of Manpower inspected the fruit stall located in a market at Blk 209 Hougang Street 21 units 01-164 and 01-171 (“the fruit stall”) and arrested Ponirah as they suspected she was working as a stall assistant there.  Units 01-164 and 01-171 were  two adjacent units, and together they constitute the fruit stall of which the Accused was the licensee.  While the two units were adjacent to each other, they were separated by a narrow walkway.
Prosecution’s evidence
4.         Prosecution’s evidence is straight forward. On 25 September 2004,  Employment Inspector  Anthony Low  (“Anthony”), led a team of MOM officers including Aw Chin Hock (“Aw”) and Fadilah bte Mohammad (“Fadilah”)  to  inspect the fruit stall for possible infringements of the Employment of Foreign Workers Act. (“EFWA”). 
Anthony and Fadilah observed the stall for about 40 minutes from  a distance of about 8 meters.  Aw was not able to recall the duration of the observation but  said that  for an inspection of this nature, the observation was usually about 15 minutes.  Nevertheless,  all three of them testified that they saw Ponirah working. Anthony saw Ponirah  assisting at the fruit stall, moving from one unit to the other. Fadilah testified that during the 40 minutes of observation, she walked along the walkway between the two  units  that made up the fruit stall 3 or 4 times to observe what Ponirah was doing. She saw Ponirah tied bunches of bananas and arranged bags of grapes for sale. When Fadilah approached Ponirah, the latter was carrying a box of fruits to put into the refrigerator. After it was established that Ponirah  was a foreign domestic worker, she was  detained and brought back to the Employment Inspectorate at MOM where she was handed over to the investigating officer, Gordon Tan (“Gordon”).  Anthony then put up an Inspection Report which was admitted and marked as  “P 2”.  He recorded in  “P 2”  -
“The Indon FDW  (foreign domestic worker) was seen tying green  bananas with string and also carrying boxes of fruits into &  within the two stalls.”  And
“1 Indon FDW was seen tying bananas  & carrying boxes of fruits @ the said stalls #01-164 & 171”
Fadilah separately put up her Arrest Report which was admitted as “P 5”. She stated in ‘P 5’ :
“I saw NC (non citizen) tying bananas behind stall #01-164. Also NC was seen putting bags of grapes at the display area. She then carried a box of fruits and put inside a freezer inside Unit 01-171.”
After Ponirah was detained, Aw took 8 photographs of the fruit stall.  He  did not take any photographs during the observation, therefore  there were no photographs of Ponirah  working. He explained that his camera used  flash light and  if he took photos during the observation, the flash that  would  be activated would alert the people in the market and  Ponirah  might run away.
5.         Ponirah  testified that she started working for the Accused in July 2002. For the initial 3 months,  she worked at the Accused’s  residence.  In the fourth month, Ponirah started to work at the fruit stall on Saturdays. From the fifth month onwards, she had to work at the fruit stall everyday, from Tuesday to Sunday. Ponirah was able to describe the daily routine activities at  the fruit stall.  She said that at about 6 a.m. each day, she followed the Accused and her husband  in their car to the market where the fruit stall was located.  There, she would perform chores towards preparing  the fruit stall for business,  e.g.  remove fruits from the refrigerator to display on the tables, hang up bunches of bananas and cut fruits like watermelons and pineapples.  Her  usual working hours at the fruit stall were from 6 a.m. to about 9 a.m.  when she would  then check with the Accused whether she could leave.  If  the Accused agreed, Ponirah would  take Bus Service no. 112 to go back to the residence where she performed household chores like cleaning, washing and cooking.
6.         Ponirah said that the fruit stall was shut on Mondays except for the one Monday each month  on  which  the monthly festive day fell. For ease of reference,  I shall describe this day as the “Special  Monday”. The fruit stall would operate on the Special Monday each month. On this Special Monday each month, devotees would buy fruits and cakes to use as offerings in their praying. Although this was a fruit stall, cakes would be sold on the Special Mondays. And, on these days, Ponirah would work at the fruit stall until about 10 a.m.  The cakes were delivered in cartons and it was  her duty  to unpack the cakes and display them on the table for sale.  
7.         Ponirah pointed to the Accused as the person who instructed  her  to work at the fruit stall  and  who told  her to go along in the car in the mornings. It was also the Accused who instructed  Ponirah how and what to do in the fruit stall, and also taught her how to handle and cut the fruits in a proper way, and how to display the fruits in the stall. 
8.         At the close of Prosecution’s case, Defence declined to  make any submission. I had no difficulty in finding that Prosecution had made out a prima facie case against the Accused and called on the Accused to enter her defence and I administered the standard allocution. The Accused elected to give evidence.  Her daughter Tan Meng Hwee  (“Meng Hwee”) was  the other defence witness.
Defence
9.         Essentially, the defence was one of denial – that  the Accused never instructed Ponirah to work at the fruit stall, and that although  Ponirah was at the fruit stall on 25 September 2004, she was not working but was pretending to work. Defence focussed on showing that Ponirah was lazy, had a boyfriend and became a threat to the Accused and family after she knew she was to be repatriated.  The Accused insisted  that  Ponirah used underhand method to “set her up” while the MOM officers who testified in court  lied. 
10.       The Accused had been selling  fruits at the fruit stall for 21 years. Her  husband also worked at the fruit stall while her three children helped during the weekends. Therefore, she did not require additional  help. She denied that Ponirah worked at the fruit stall at all as  her duties were only doing household chores like laundry, cleaning and cooking meals for the family. Once a week, on Sundays, Ponirah would do the groceries shopping  for the family at the market where the fruit stall was located. Hence, at most, Ponirah would go to the fruit stall once a week and that would be on  Sunday mornings. During the term of the first employment contract, Ponirah’s work performance was good and she was hard working. But, after  she returned from Indonesia on 1
st
 July 2004 to commence her second contract of employment, her work attitude deteriorated. The Accused found her to be lazy and she  refused to do a lot of work.
11.  The Accused referred to an incident that occurred some time in late July 2004  to  show Ponirah’s poor work attitude, that she  was a liar and so her evidence should not be believed. On that day,  Ponirah failed to return to the Accused’s residence at the usual time of 9 a.m. after marketing, instead she returned after 10 a.m. When questioned by the Accused’s daughter Meng Hwee,  Ponirah said she had gone to visit her cousin who was working as a domestic maid at the next block. Meng Hwee then confronted Ponirah and her cousin  over  this and concluded that  Ponirah  lied about visiting her cousin. I  felt this was a very minor incident  which  had no bearing on  this charge faced by the Accused. Neither  should this weigh against Ponirah in assessing her credibility as a witness. Even if  Ponirah did lie  over this incident of  returning home 1 hour later than the usual time,  it was a white lie told in desperation in view of Meng Hwee’s  aggressive stance.
12.       The Accused alleged that nuisance phone calls  were made to the  home and  the caller hanged up when she answered the phone. The Accused believed that the caller was Ponirah’s boyfriend. On 18 September 2004, the Accused brought Ponirah to the maid agency to check who had been phoning Ponirah and 
“to confront her (Ponirah) with this”
.   Both the employment agent and the Accused informed Ponirah that she was to be repatriated. Ponirah immediately responded by warning the Accused that while she (Ponirah) would be sent back, the Accused would be harmed by someone unknown. The Court sought clarification and Defence Counsel confirmed that his instructions were that at the agency, 
both
 the employment agent and the Accused told Ponirah at the same time that she was to be sent back and Ponirah’s immediate response was to utter the said threat. In such circumstance,  the employment agent must have heard Ponirah’s threat. Because of this threat, the Accused was fearful and had no choice but to bring Ponirah to the fruit stall everyday. And, from 19 September 2004 onwards, the Accused brought Ponirah to the fruit stall everyday so that she could keep a watchful eye on her until her repatriation.  The Accused claimed that when Ponirah was at the fruit stall, she chatted with people behind the fruit stall and did not work.
13.       On 23 September 2004, the Accused changed the residential phone number and the nuisance or prank calls stopped.  On 28
th
 September 2004, she lodged a police report which was admitted as “D 4” regarding these  nuisance or prank phone calls.
14.       Meng Hwee’s evidence was  similar to what the Accused testified – that Ponirah was an excellent worker during her first employment contract but during the second employment contract her work attitude deteriorated, became lazy, was a liar and  started to receive many phone calls. She also denied that Ponirah worked at the fruit stall.
Purpose and reliability of police report “D 4”
15.       Defence introduced “D 4” to substantiate the Accused’s explanation for Ponirah’s presence at the fruit stall, I therefore examined this document in detail. The chronology of events was as follows :
(a) On 18 September 2004,because of the prank calls, the Accused brought Ponirah to the employment agency where Ponirah threatened the Accused that someone would harm her.
(b) From 19 September 2004, the Accused started bringing Ponirah to the fruit stall because she (Accused) was fearful of what Ponirah would do to her and her family in view of her threat.
(c) On 23 September 2004, the Accused changed the residential phone number because of nuisance/prank calls received. These calls stopped after the phone number was changed.
(d) On 25 September 2004, MOM officers inspected the fruit stall and detained Ponirah.
(e) On 28 September 2004, the Accused lodged police report “D 4” because she was afraid for her own safety and the safety of her family because of the nuisance phone calls and Ponirah’s threat uttered at the employment agency.  “D 4” read as follows :
“Since about two weeks ago I had been received calls from an unknown caller. This unknown caller alway  called and hanged up.
However whenever my Indonesian maid, Ponirah F/22 picked up the call this unknown caller will talk to her. She told me that the caller was one Dhana te.: 81157927. My maid had been working for me for the past two years. As I fear that whenever I am working my maid would bring this unknown subject to my house. As such I would bring her to my workingplace everyday since 15/09/2004 to avoid my maid see this unknown subject.
I had since cancelled my previous residential number (63839584) due to the continuous calling of this unknown subject.
I am lodging this report for my self references and for future actions against the nuisance calls made by this unknown subjects.”
16.       It was pointed out that there was no mention of Ponirah’s threat or the Accused’s fear for her safety and her family’s safety in “D 4”.  Instead, her fear was that Ponirah would bring the subject to the house and she brought Ponirah to her work place to prevent her (Ponirah) from seeing the unknown caller. The Accused asserted that she could not read and she left it to the police officer to write. She agreed “D 4” was read back to her but claimed she did not really understand. And though she was given a copy of “D 4” which she took this home, she did not show it to anybody at home, giving the lame excuse that they were all asleep. Neither did she show “D4” to her children thereafter because 
“I did not think the police will cheat me.”
   (para E pg 69 of N/E). The Accused raised these allegations against the police officer for the first time in her cross examination. Prior to this, she had no complaints even though she had  “D 4” since 28 September 2004 and she had shown “D 4” to her lawyer whom she consulted after she was served with the MOM summons for this charge.
17.       The Accused’s explanation for the delay in making “D 4” i.e. 5 days after the prank calls had stopped, was that the more she thought about it, the more fearful she was. She said,
“It was what I read in the newspapers and what I hear from people that I became more fearful. In case I was murdered, the police will have records.”
I found her explanation absurd. And, I felt that while there may have been phonecalls made to the Accused’s residence, these did not cause such fear as she alleged. The mysterious caller did not utter any threats. If the Accused did indeed harbour fear of being murdered, she would have stated Ponirah’s threat and such fear in “D 4” and requested police investigations.  The police could have investigated easily by calling up the suspects – Dhana and Ponirah, since their identity and telephone numbers were known, thereby putting an end to her fears. She did none of these. In fact, she stated in “D 4” that she was lodging the report for 
“self reference”
. I noted that in “D 4” the Accused stressed on why she brought Ponirah to the fruit stall but did not   mention that Ponirah had been detained by MOM officers on 25 September 2004. “D 4” was markedly different from the Accused’s testimony in Court. The Accused’s conduct in this whole episode was just unbelievable. She claimed to hold intense fear of Ponirah and the prank caller, to the extent that she feared being murdered. Yet, she was satisfied with making a report the contents of which she did not understand and which she did not show to anybody to verify the contents or discuss her fear with anyone. She said that she made the report to prove her innocence but was vague and evasive when asked how “D4” could help to prove her innocence.
18.       In the circumstances, I gave no weight to “D 4” and it did not help the Defence’s case. The Accused made the police report “D 4” on 28 September 2004 – which was 4 days after Ponirah was arrested at the fruit stall and 5 days after the residential telephone number was changed and the prank calls had ceased. The source of her fear had been removed, what then was the purpose of  lodging “D 4” ?  My inevitable conclusion is that  this was an after thought and was  the Accused’s attempt to manufacture  evidence for herself, to back-up her explanation for Ponirah’s presence at the fruit stall.
Did Ponirah work at the fruit stall regularly and was she instructed to work?
19.       Ponirah was clear and unequivocal in her testimony.  She described, without hesitation and with clarity the routine and her duties at the fruit stall. Ponirah was also able to describe that on the Special Monday each month, special cakes that devotees offered in their praying were displayed and sold. This was an unusual fact because the inspected stall was a fruit stall, yet, cakes were sold on that one Special Monday each month. Both the Accused and Meng Hwee testified that Ponirah went to the fruit stall only on Sunday mornings to purchase groceries for the household, after that she would go home. The Accused was evasive and gave various  explanations as to how Ponirah could have known such details when she was not at the fruit stall on Mondays. She said she had told Ponirah about the selling of the cakes on special occasions because she (Ponirah) had found it strange. This begs the question since  Ponirah  (according to the Accused)  was not at the fruit stall on Mondays, so she would not have seen the cakes being sold.  Then, the Accused claimed that the cakes were delivered on the night between Saturday and Sunday and Ponirah must have seen the cakes on Sunday. This differed from Meng Hwee’s version that the cakes were delivered on Sunday morning and it could be as early as 7 a.m. or as late as the afternoon. The Accused then said that after 19 September 2004, she brought Ponirah to the fruit stall every morning after 19
th
 September 2004. However, it was easily established that from 19 September 2004 until the day of Ponirah’s arrest on 25 September 2004, there were no Special Mondays when these cakes were sold. 
20.       Ponirah was also able to describe who worked or helped at the fruit stall. She said that usually, the Accused, her husband and Ponirah were at the stall. The Accused’s daughter (Meng Hwee) helped out on Saturdays and Sundays while the Accused’s third son helped out on Sundays. Again, these are information which Ponirah would not know unless she was at the fruit stall regularly.
21.       An important consideration was the evidence of the other Prosecution witnesses, i.e. the MOM officers.  As I had elaborated in preceding paragraphs, Anthony, Fadilah and Aw saw Ponirah performing the various tasks in the fruit stall.  They observed that Ponirah worked independently, and they did not see anyone teach or instruct her what to do. This showed that Ponirah was familiar with her duties and knew what and how to go about doing her chores in the fruit stall without being told.  And this must be because she had been doing these regularly. This was an open fruit stall in the market, it was not possible that the Accused and her daughter did not see Ponirah perform the tasks that the MOM officers saw. I was satisfied that Ponirah was working on 25 September 2004, she could not be pretending to work as the Accused alleged.
22.       It was not plausible that the Accused would bring Ponirah – the source of threat, to the fruit stall where Ponirah would have even more chances to generate mischief.  The Accused had to manage the fruit stall which spanned 2 units. It did not make sense for the Accused to bring Ponirah to the busy market, leave her behind the fruit stall and then checked every 5 to 15 minutes to see what she was doing. Apart from this being a time consuming exercise, this could not an effective way of keeping watch over Ponirah who was a threat to the family. To start with, there would be ample opportunity for Ponirah to run away or contact her supposed boy-friend and mysterious prank caller.  Given the Accused’s fears,  it would make better sense  to leave Ponirah with the employment agent who must have heard the alleged threat made by Ponirah in the agency,  until her repatriation, or to repatriate Ponirah immediately, or report Ponirah to the police.
23.       The Accused insisted that she had never seen Ponirah worked at the fruit stall and went on to comment that if Ponirah wanted to 
“set her up”
, there was nothing that she (the Accused) could do.  However, she contradicted herself in her Re-examination  when she said (at para d to E page 80 of N/E) :
‘…  But I know my worker will pretend to be working and selling stuff to give people the impression  that she was working.”   and  
“ …She would pretend to fiddle with stuffs to give people impression that she was helping.” 
The Accused must have seen Ponirah do these activities for her  to testify in this manner. And, logically, Ponirah must be in the fruit stall to be able to pretend to fiddle with the fruits and to sell stuff to people. It is also amazing that the Accused, knowing (as she claimed) that Ponirah would pretend to work, would  continue to bring Ponirah to the fruit stall thereby expose herself to being “set up” by Ponirah and being charged for the  offence of deploying her domestic maid to perform non domestic work at the fruit stall.
24.     Ponirah’s evidence was that from the fourth month of her employment with the Accused, she started working in the fruit stall on the Accused’s instructions. The Accused was Ponirah’s employer and the main person in the household issuing instructions to Ponirah.   Looking at all the facts and circumstances,  I believed Ponirah  – she would not be at the fruit stall if she was not instructed to go there. As the Accused  was her employer and the licensee of the fruit stall, I accepted Ponirah’s evidence that it was the Accused who instructed  her to work in the fruit stall and who taught her what and how to perform the various chores in the fruit stall.  
Credibility of the witnesses
25.       The Accused was the licensee of the fruit stall and had been running it for 21 years.  From her demeanour and near defiant and almost aggressive attitude in court, she was certainly not a woman who could be easily frightened by one verbal threat uttered by her foreign domestic maid. Her inconsistent evidence in court, her readiness to caste baseless aspersions against the Prosecution witnesses, and her ingenuity in coming up with “D 4”, convinced me that she was not truthful.
26.       Likewise, Meng Hwee insisted that she did not see Ponirah work at the fruit stall. In cross examination, she conceded that if Ponirah was working in the front of the fruit stall,  she would have noticed. Since  3 MOM officers  saw Ponirah working and  she was moving between the 2 units,  I do not believe that Meng Hwee.  It was obvious to me that  she  was lying to help her mother.
27.       The Accused cast serious allegations against the law enforcement officers. She accused MOM officers of lying (pages 57, and 65 to 66 of N/E), and that the police officer who recorded “D 4” cheated her.
These are serious allegations and went to the root of the prosecution’s case. Yet, during their cross examination, Defence did not question the witnesses about their lying.  The MOM officers did not seem to be acquainted with the Accused.  I saw no reason for them, being public officers, to lie against the Accused. They would have a lot to lose but nothing to gain by giving false evidence. I am perplexed as to why all these law enforcement officers would lie and act against her.
29.          From whatever angle I considered in assessing the officers’ credibility,  I  felt  the MOM officers  were  objective  witnesses  who  stated  what  they  saw. I had no doubt that they were truthful witnesses. 
Other Points raised in submission
30.       Defence doubted that the MOM officers could have observed the fruit stall for the duration of 40 minutes.  I found that in this case, the actual duration of the observation was of little consequence. It was the quality of the observation that was crucial. I had no doubt at all that the MOM officers were not mistaken in their observation. At the end of the trial, Defence  backtracked  and I take this to be Defence conceding that MOM officers were truthful after all. Defence Counsel submitted as recorded at paragraph C  page 111 of N/E :
“Ponirah was doing the acts that officers (MOM officers) saw but these were not under the instructions of the Accused.”
31.       Defence also made an issue that there were no photographs taken of Ponirah working. Since the Defence was that Ponirah pretended to work, the absence of such photographs should not matter to the Defence case.  Anthony, Aw and Fadilah did their own observations as they moved about in the market. There were 3 eye witnesses who saw Ponirah working at the fruit stall. The fact that there was no photograph to show Ponirah working did not in any way weaken Prosecution’s case. 
32.       Prosecution invited me to draw adverse inference under Illustration (g) to s 116 of the Evidence Act, against the Accused for failing to call her husband, sons and neighbouring stall owners in the market. Illustration (g) to s 116 provides:
The court may presume that evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced be unfavourable to the person who withholds it.”
I do not agreed with Prosecution. These persons are not material witnesses  and the failure to call them was not unfavourable to the defence. Meng Hwee had testified and it can be expected that these persons, if called, would testify along the same line. These persons, even if called,  could not negate the charge against the Accused. This case did not fall within the qualification explained in 
PP v Nurashikin binte Ahmad Borhan (2003)1 SLR 52
.
Finding
33.       Having considered all the facts and circumstances, I was satisfied that Prosecution had proven the case beyond reasonable doubt and convicted the Accused of the charge.
Mitigation and sentence
34.       The  sentence  prescribed  by  law  for  an offence  under  section  5(3)  of  the  Employment of Foreign Workers Act (Cap 91A) is a fine not exceeding $5,000/=. 
35.       The Accused was convicted on 18 October 1975 of employing prohibited immigrants. Apart from urging the court to consider that this was a conviction of 30 years ago, Defence had nothing to say in mitigation.  Although this can be said to be an “old” conviction, it nevertheless showed that the Accused was not ignorant of the law on employment of foreign workers.  She had previous brush with the law and knew that what she was doing was an offence. Her aspersions against MOM officers and the police officer showed she was not at all remorseful and had total disregard for law enforcement officers.  After considering all the facts and circumstances of he case,  including that the offence was committed over a period of almost 2 years,  I imposed a fine of $4,000/=.  To my mind, the quantum of the fine is not at all excessive.",2005-10-26 00:00:00,SG Magistrates' Court

Magistrate Miranda Yeo:
The charge
1          The accused pleaded guilty to the following charge of theft:
“that you, on the 3
rd
 day of October 2005, at or about 11 am, at Number 111, North Bridge Road, Peninsula Plaza, did commit theft of the following:-
1) One pair of New Balance sneakers amounting to $109.00
with a total value of $109.00, in the possession of, Chay Kum Thong, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 379 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.”
The accused confirmed that he understood the nature and consequences of his plea.
Sentence
2          The accused was convicted and sentenced to a fine of $800, in default one week’s imprisonment.
The facts
3          The accused admitted to the Amended Statement of Facts pertaining to the charge without qualification. The salient points of the Amended Statement of Facts are as follows:
a.         The Complainant is one Chay Kum Thong.
b.         On 3
rd
 October 2005, the accused entered the Bata shoe shop attended by the complainant located at Number 111, North Bridge Road, Peninsula Plaza. The accused then asked for a pair of size 11 New Balance sneakers from the complainant to try on and the complainant obliged. 
c          At about 11 a.m., the accused walked briskly out of the shoe shop when the complainant left the accused briefly unattended. At the point when the accused left the store, he was wearing the pair of New Balance sneakers amounting to $109.00 in the possession of the complainant which was unpaid for.
d.         The complainant gave chase and managed to detain the accused. The police were summoned and the accused was placed under arrest.
e.         The accused admitted to having the intention of committing theft of the shoes.
Antecedents
4          The accused had no antecedents.
Mitigation
5          The accused had nothing to say in mitigation. 
The Prosecution
6          The Prosecution did not submit on sentence.
Sentencing considerations
7          The punishment prescribed under section 379 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 1985 Revised Edition) is a fine or imprisonment of up to three years or both. Under section 11(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68, 1985 Revised Edition  ), the maximum fine that a Magistrate’s Court may impose is $2,000. I took into consideration the fact that the value of the item stolen ($109.00) was relatively small, that the accused had a clean criminal record and had decided to plead guilty. In the circumstances, I imposed a fine of $800.
8          The accused is however dissatisfied with the sentence and filed an appeal on 14 October 2005. He has already paid the fine imposed.

Tan Lee Meng J (delivering the judgment of the court):
1
         
 This case concerns an application by the Law Society of Singapore (“the Law Society”) pursuant to s 94A, read with s 98(1), of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2001 Rev Ed) (“the LPA”), for the respondent, Mr Jayaram Bala Subramaniam, an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore, to show cause why he should not be dealt with under s 83(2)(
a
) of the LPA. We ordered the respondent to be struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors and now give the reasons for our decision.
Background
2
         
 The respondent, who was called to the Bar on 8 November 1978, was the sole proprietor of M/s Bala & Co (“the firm”) at all material times. In breach of his obligations to his clients, he used funds in the clients’ account for his personal expenses. The amount of clients’ money misappropriated by him was $238,420.60 and he only managed to return $109,700.00 to them.
3
         
 Eight charges were preferred against the respondent. With respect to breach of trust, he faced six charges under s 409 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) and one charge under s 406 of the Penal Code. He also faced a charge under s 33(2) of the LPA for preparing a sale and purchase agreement between June to September 2001 when he did not have a practising certificate to act as an advocate and solicitor.
4
         
 The Prosecution proceeded with only four charges. The first charge relates to the purchase of a property by two of the respondent’s clients, Ms Nancy Arifin and her late father, in 2000. Ms Arifin took a loan from Overseas Union Bank (“OUB”) to finance the purchase of the property and a cashier’s order for $35,061.60 was forwarded by OUB to the respondent for payment of the stamp and registration fees for the transfer of the property. This sum was misappropriated by the respondent.
5
         
 The second charge concerned the purchase of property by Pang Jang Enterprises Pte Ltd (“Pang Jang”). On 20 July 1999, the respondent requested Pang Jang to forward to him $11,338 for the registration and stamp fees due for the transfer of the said property. After receiving this sum from Pang Jang, the respondent misappropriated it.
6
         
 The third charge faced by the respondent was in relation to his dealings with Chip Soon Aluminium Pte Ltd (“Chip Soon”). He requested Chip Soon to hand over a sum of $45,658 to him for the purpose of paying for the registration and stamp fees due on the transfer of a property being purchased by the company. After receiving the funds from Chip Soon, he used the money to pay for his own expenses.
7
         
 As for the fourth charge against the respondent, the complainant was Mr Manganmal Jhamathmal Lalwani (“Lalwani”), who engaged the former to handle the purchase of a property. Lalwani forwarded to the firm two cheques, one for $30,000 and the other for $6,663, for the purpose of paying a deposit to the vendor and for registration and stamp fees. The respondent used the money to pay his own creditors.
8
         
 The respondent, who said that his sole purpose in misappropriating the funds in question was to pay his staff and his office rental, pleaded guilty to the charges against him. He asked the court to note that he had fully and willingly co-operated with the police and had volunteered information to them so that the investigation could be concluded speedily. On 30 August 2002, he was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 39 months. He has since served the sentence.
9
         
 Pursuant to s 94A(1) of the LPA, the Law Society proceeded with an application for the respondent to show cause why he should not be dealt with under the provisions of s 83(2)(
a
) of the LPA. On 16 October 2004, a show cause Order of Court was obtained and in the proceedings before us, the Law Society applied for this show cause order to be made absolute and for the respondent to bear the cost of the proceedings.
10
       
 Cases of dishonest use of clients’ funds must be viewed very seriously by the court. In 
Law Society of Singapore v Ravindra Samuel
 
[1999] 1 SLR 696
 at [12], the court, while referring to the requirement that lawyers be honest in their work, stated as follows:
The administration of justice can only proceed on the basis that solicitors can place reliance upon the honesty of the solicitors with whom they deal. The public too must be able to repose confidence in a profession which plays so indispensable a part in the administration of justice. Similarly, the courts of this country must be able to depend on the honesty and integrity of all practitioners appearing before them and to expect that they will maintain the highest standards of personal honesty and integrity in their dealings with the courts.
11
       
 For the purpose of determining the appropriate penalty to be imposed on the respondent, it is worth noting that in 
Law Society of Singapore v Lau See-Jin Jeffrey
 
[1999] 2 SLR 215
, the court noted that disciplinary action under s 83 of the LPA serves three functions, namely the punishment of the errant solicitor, deterrence against similar defaults by other solicitors in the future and the protection of public confidence in the administration of justice. In 
Law Society of Singapore v Ravindra Samuel
, the court held that where a solicitor had acted dishonestly, he should be struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors. The court accepted at [13] that it had a duty to itself, to the rest of the profession and to the community “to be careful not to accredit any person as worthy of public confidence and therefore fit to [practise] as an advocate and solicitor who cannot satisfactorily establish his right to those credentials”.
12
       
 The respondent in the present case has been convicted of committing criminal breach of trust and dishonest misappropriation of money entrusted to him by his clients. By committing these offences, he has shown that he is unfit to practise as an advocate and solicitor. We thus ordered the respondent to be struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors. We also ordered him to pay the cost of these proceedings.",2005-09-12 00:00:00,SG High Court

District Judge Remedios F. G.
1          Accused was upon his plea of guilty convicted on the following charge:
“DAC 35081/05 (Exhibit P1A)
You,
Chong Koh Leong, Male/25 years old
NRIC No. S-7935068-J
are charged that you, sometime in 2001, at Block 13 Tai Seng Drive #06-02, did abet one Lim Tze Meng, Nric No: S-1658339-A, to commit the offence of Criminal Breach of Trust, by intentionally aiding the said Lim Tze Meng, who was entrusted with the following property, by M/s Luxasia Private Limited,
1)         413 bottles of Jean Paul Gaultier perfume valued at a unit price of $24.11/- (Total value $9957.43/-)
2)         336 bottles of Issey Miyake Femme perfume valued at a unit price of $29.22/- (Total value $9817.92/-)
3)         171 bottles of Bvlgari Blue Female perfume valued at a unit price of $29.52/- (Total value $5047.92/-)
with a total value of $24,823.27/- to dishonestly misappropriate the said property, which offence was committed in consequence of your abetment, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 406 read with Section 109 of the Penal Code Chapter 224.”
2          The facts were as follows:
“           The complainant is (A1) Margaret Foo Swee Tian, female/39 years old, Nric: S-1652248-A.  She is the Business Development Manager of Luxasia Private Limited, located at Luxasia Building, Block 13 Tai Seng Drive #06-02.
2.         The accused is (B1) Chong Koh Leong, male/25 years old, Nric: S-7935068-J.  He was working as a temporary staff for Luxasia Private Limited.
3.         The co-accused are:
B2)       Lim Tze Meng, male/41 years, Nric: S-1658339-A.  He was working as a Warehouse Supervisor for Luxasia Private Limited.
B3)       Adam See Kah Poo, male/33 years, Nric: S-7224833-C.  He was working as a Sales Manager for ‘Perfume Mania’ located at Number 160 Paya Lebar Road #06-05, Orion Industrial Building.
4.         On 17 Sep 03 at about 11:07 a.m. at Clementi Police Division Headquarters, A1 lodged a police report stating that goods (assorted brands of perfume) were missing from their warehouse located at Luxasia Building, Block 13 Tai Seng Drive #06-02.
5.         Investigations revealed that some time in September 2003, Luxasia Private Limited carried out a stock check and found huge quantity of their assorted brands of perfume products, missing.
6.         Investigations revealed that sometime in 2001, B1 and B2 co-operated to steal perfume products from the warehouse of Luxasia Private Limited and sell it to B3.  B1 and B2 thereafter took several cartons of Jean Paul Gaultier perfumes, containing 413 bottles of perfumes and several other cartons of Issey Miyake perfumes, containing 336 bottles of perfumes from the said warehouse and loaded the goods into B2’s company van.
7          B2 then took the said cartons of Jean Paul Gaultier perfumes and Issey Miyake perfumes and sold it to B3 for around $30/- per bottle of Jean Paul Gaultier perfume and $38/- per bottle of Issey Miyake perfume.  B3 thereafter paid B2 a total amount of around $25,158/- for the said sale.  B2 later gave B1 $3000/- as his share from the sales of the stolen cartons of Jean Paul Gaultier and Issey Miyake perfumes.
8.         Investigations revealed that sometime later in 2001, B1 and B2 again co-operated to steal perfume products from the warehouse of Luxasia Private Limited and sell it to B3.  B1 and B2 therefore took several cartons of Bvlgari Blue Female perfumes, containing 171 bottles of perfumes from the said warehouse and loaded the goods into B2’s company van.  B2 then took the cartons of Bvlgari Blue Female perfumes and sold it to B3 for $32/- per bottle.  B3 thereafter paid B2 a total amount of around $5472/- for the said sale.  B2 later gave B1 $2000/- as his share from the sales of the stolen cartons of Bvlgari Blue Female perfumes.
9.         Investigations have revealed that B1 had intentionally aided B2  to dishonestly misappropriate the 413 bottles of Jean Paul Gaultier, 336 bottles of Issey Miyake Femme and 171 bottles of Bvlgari Blue female perfumes,
 
belonging to Luxasia Private Limited and had as such aided B2 to commit criminal breach.
10.        B1 has admitted receiving a total of $5000/- from the sales of the stolen perfumes and thereafter using the proceeds on bills and entertainment.
11.        B1 has admitted abetting B2 to commit the theft of the perfume products from Luxasia Private Limited.”
3          After the conviction was recorded the court queried the prosecution with regard to the value of the items in the charge as it was not consistent that a buyer of stolen goods would pay more ($25,158.00 + $5,472.00 = $30,630.00) than the actual value (according to the charge $24,823.27) of the goods.  (In the original charge (Exhibit P1) the value of the goods was stated as $48,181.00).  Prosecution informed the court that the value of the goods in the amended charge was the cost price of the goods which was 50% of market value.
4          A written mitigation was tendered by defence counsel (marked “M”) and it was read out.  The court noted that facts and circumstances of the offence as narrated in the written mitigation was not consistent with the Statement of Facts. (It would, from the written mitigation appear that counsel was attempting to persuade the court that the accused was not guilty of the offence charged as it was stated that the accused when assisting Lim Tze Meng to remove the goods from the warehouse did not then know that Lim Tze Meng was doing so illegally.)  It was noted that when the Statement of Facts was read to the accused, the accused had admitted to the accuracy of the facts in the Statement of Facts and did not qualify or attempt to qualify his admission.  All parties were informed that the court had noted the facts in the Statement of Facts and facts in mitigation were not quite the same and court informed that sentence imposed would be in accordance with the Statement of Facts.  The court’s announcement was not met with any application from the accused to retract his plea of guilty.
5          In order that the sentence imposed on the accused would not be inconsistent with sentences passed on the named accomplices, Lim Tze Meng and Adam See Kah Poo, the court queried the prosecution with regard to the sentences imposed on them.  The case was then adjourned to 28 Sept 05.
6          On 28 Sept 05, the court was informed that 3 others had been sentenced with regard to property stolen from M/s Luxasia Private Limited.
7          With regard to the 2 accomplices mentioned in the Statement of Facts only Lim Tze Meng had been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for a total of 18 months.  He had 2 charges under s.407 of the Penal Code and the value of the items in the charges was $57,197.00. One Yong Sain Voon was also sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months for an offence under s.414 of the Penal Code.  No information was given by prosecution with regard to his role and value of property involved (Exhibit B).
8          Court noted that one Ang Hoe Heng was sentenced to imprisonment for 2 months for an offence under s.406 of the Penal Code where the value of the stolen property was $17,958.80.  Court queried prosecution as to who he was as there was no reference to him in the Statement of Facts.  All that prosecution could inform was that he was a temporary staff of M/s Luxasia Private Limited and had worked as a packer.
9          In determining the sentence to be imposed, the facts and circumstances of the offences were considered.  The plea of guilty was also considered.  The accused had assisted another to illegally remove a substantial quantity of goods from his employer’s premises on two occasions and the court was of the view that counsel’s request for a fine could not be acceded to.  After considering the accused’s plea of guilt,  the sentence passed on the accomplice, the quantity and value of the goods involved in the offence, the court was of the view that a sentence  of imprisonment for 8 months would be appropriate and the sentence was accordingly imposed.",2005-10-06 00:00:00,SG District Court

Lai Siu Chiu J:
Introduction
1          At the conclusion of the trial, I awarded interlocutory judgment to Lim Kau Tee and Ang Soi Hiang (“the plaintiffs”), who are husband and wife respectively, against Lee Kay Li (‘the defendant”). The defendant has now appealed against my judgment (in Civil Appeal No 63 of 2005).
2          The plaintiffs are the owners of a Housing and Development Board (“HDB”) shophouse situated at Block 713, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6, #01-4040, Singapore 560713 (“the property”), which they purchased from the Post Office Savings Bank (with HDB’s consent) in 1995 for $5.6m. The property comprised two storeys with a total area of 448m².
3          The plaintiffs had used the second storey of the property as an office for their business since their purchase in 1995. The defendant was a tenant of the ground floor for three years from 1 May 2000 by a tenancy agreement dated 27 March 2000. The parties subsequently entered into a second tenancy agreement dated 15 April 2003 (“the Tenancy Agreement”) which was intended to be for another three years.
4          Eleven months after the commencement of the second tenancy, the defendant vacated the premises (on 24 March 2004). The plaintiffs alleged that the defendant had wrongfully repudiated the lease. The defendant on the other hand claimed that the plaintiffs had, by their actions which will be elaborated on hereunder, evinced an intention to be no longer bound by the Tenancy Agreement and were the ones who had repudiated the lease.
The facts
5          According to the first plaintiff, he had bought the property in the belief that the property was for commercial use with an approved structural loading of 1.5kN/m², on the basis of a print-out provided by HDB at the time of purchase. However, sometime either in late December 2001 or in early January 2002, the plaintiffs were informed by a HDB technician that the property had too many air conditioning units, and that this was not allowed for living quarters.
6          The plaintiffs’ chief operating officer (“COO”) then checked the lease instrument of the property and discovered that the plan thereto described the property as comprising a first storey shop of 204m² and a second storey living quarters of 204m².
7          The first plaintiff testified that he then sought to rectify the discrepancy between HDB’s enquiry print-out and what was described in the lease. On 28 January 2002, the plaintiffs’ solicitors wrote to HDB for their consent to a change of use of the property. On 6 February 2002, HDB replied saying that it had no objections to changing the use of the property provided that structural works were carried out to increase the loading of the second storey. This was because the existing loading of 1.5kN/m² was insufficient.
8          The plaintiffs’ solicitors replied to HDB on 12 June 2002, requesting for the change of use without any works to be done on the basis that at the time of the purchase of the property, the property was described as having been constructed with the approved loading for commercial use; HDB did not reply to this letter.
9          The plaintiffs also applied to the Urban Redevelopment Authority (“URA”) and were granted permission on 4 December 2003, valid for a period of three years, to effect a change of use of the second storey from living quarters to office use.
10        On 12 December 2003, the plaintiffs’ solicitors again wrote to HDB, asking for a response to their earlier request that the change of use be made without the need for strengthening works to the structural floor of the second storey. Again there was no response from HDB.
11        According to the first plaintiff, in view of HDB’s long silence, he became anxious that his investment in the property would be compromised. On the advice of the plaintiffs’ COO, the plaintiffs decided to carry out the works proposed by HDB so as to allow the change of use to be effected.
12        By a letter dated 9 January 2004, the plaintiffs informed the defendant of the proposed works. The letter stated that “As per requirement by the Housing & Development Board, we have to strengthen the ceiling structure.” The letter also stated that the defendant was “required to remove all [his] stocks and furniture by 24
th 
 March 2004” to facilitate the works which were planned for a period of 29 days from 25 March 2004 to 22 April 2004.
13        The plaintiffs claimed that they then entered into negotiations with the defendant in relation to their request. Doris, a member of the plaintiffs’ staff, contacted the defendant’s staff (Margaret Cheong) on 12 January 2004, asking whether the defendant had received the plaintiffs’ letter of 9 January 2004. During this conversation, upon Margaret’s request, Doris (with the first plaintiff’s agreement) agreed to waive a month’s rental for the defendant. However, Doris rejected Margaret’s request that the shoe shelves and cabinets in the premises be left behind.
14        On 18 February 2004, Doris called Margaret again to confirm that the shelves and cabinets would be removed for the works. Margaret replied that the defendant had not reverted to her but repeated that the defendant would move his stock to allow the works to be done.
15        The defendant claimed that he only received the letter dated 9 January 2004 on or about 23 February 2004 because it was delivered by hand to his outlet at the premises and his outlet manager only forwarded the letter to him on the said date. Upon receiving the letter, he then instructed his operations manager, Mr Eric, to contact the plaintiffs’ staff to make further enquiries.
16        Subsequently, in the first week of March 2004, two of the defendant’s staff (the operations manager, Mr Eric, and the operations and financial controller, Miss Kholyn Suarez Apolinar) met the plaintiffs’ project manager, Mr Raymond Tang. Together, they viewed the premises to assess the areas that would be affected by the works. According to the plaintiffs, at the end of this meeting, the defendant’s operations manager told the plaintiffs’ project manager that the defendant should be able to hand over the premises on 24 March 2004 for the works to begin on 25 March 2004. Hence, on 8 March 2004, the plaintiffs’ COO wrote to the defendant seeking confirmation that the defendant had agreed to hand over the vacant unit to the plaintiffs on 24 March 2004.
17        According to the defendant, after this meeting, he decided that he would not vacate the premises unless the plaintiffs paid his costs and expenses for doing so. Sometime between 8 March 2004 and 13 March 2004, the defendant went to the plaintiffs’ office where he met Doris, and asked to be compensated for the costs to be incurred in his moving out. By a letter dated 13 March 2004, the defendant sought to recover from the plaintiffs: (a) the cost of moving out his stock and furniture, (b) costs of rental for a temporary warehouse, (c) compensation for loss of sales and salary for two months (amounting to $20,000), (d) renovation and reinstatement costs of $80,000, (e) the reinstatement by the plaintiffs of the ceiling, lightings, air-conditioning and air-curtains and (f) the waiver of one month’s rental.
18        On 15 March 2004, the defendant’s staff met the plaintiffs’ staff again and reiterated the foregoing demands, which were turned down by the plaintiffs’ COO.
19        On the very same day, the defendant’s staff sent the plaintiffs a fax (at 8.18pm), and by hand the next day (16 March 2004) a letter requesting to see HDB’s letter stipulating that the plaintiffs had to carry out strengthening works.
20        Subsequently, on 18 March 2004, the defendant, through his solicitors, again requested for a copy of HDB’s letter to the plaintiff. This letter also said that the plaintiffs’ letter of 9 January 2004 amounted in effect to a demand for the defendant to vacate the premises, which the defendant would not comply with. Further, if the plaintiffs insisted on removing the defendant from the premises, the defendant would resist and hold the plaintiffs liable for consequential losses suffered as a result.
21        Pursuant to the request by the defendant to see the letter from HDB, the plaintiffs’ solicitors finally forwarded a copy to the defendant’s solicitors on 22 March 2004. In a letter dated 23 March 2004, the defendant through his solicitors alleged that the plaintiffs, by not informing the defendant at the time of renewal of the tenancy agreement that the defendant would have to vacate the premises for the strengthening works, had intentionally misled the defendant into signing the Tenancy Agreement, which the defendant would not otherwise have signed had he been apprised of this fact. On 24 March 2004, two days after receiving the letter from HDB to the plaintiff, the defendant moved out of the premises and on 31 March 2004, the defendant’s solicitors returned the keys of the premises to the plaintiffs’ solicitors.
The pleadings
22        In the Amended Statement of Claim, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant had by his conduct, evinced an intention no longer to be bound by the Tenancy Agreement and had repudiated the same.
23        In the Defence and Counterclaim, the defendant denied that he had repudiated the tenancy and contended that he had rescinded the Tenancy Agreement on the basis of the plaintiffs’ misrepresentation. The defendant averred that in view of the extremely competitive retail sector in Singapore, he was prepared to enter into a second tenancy at the plaintiffs’ premises (as stated in his letter dated 10 March 2003 to the plaintiffs) only if the plaintiffs would agree to:
(a)        a reduction in the monthly rental from $19,000 to $15,000 as this would translate into significant savings for the defendant in the long term; and
(b)        a tenancy period of three years instead of the two years (plus one year’s renewal) provided for in the first tenancy agreement as this would translate into a longer depreciation period for the renovation costs of the premises incurred at the commencement of the first tenancy period and significant cost savings as a result of not having to renovate new premises for an additional three years.
24        The defendant alleged that the plaintiffs had represented to him that the monthly rental would be reduced from $19,000 to $17,000 and that they had misrepresented that he would be allowed the uninterrupted use and occupation of the premises for an additional period of three years. Induced by and in reliance upon the plaintiffs’ representations, the defendant entered into the Tenancy Agreement with the plaintiffs.
25        The defendant pleaded that the plaintiffs had made the representation fraudulently, in that the plaintiffs knew that it was false. The defendant alleged that the plaintiffs knew as early as 6 February 2002 that the defendant would have to vacate the premises in order for strengthening works to be done. The defendant also argued that the plaintiffs knew, at the time of making the representation, that the works would be carried out during the second tenancy. Alternatively, the defendant argued that the plaintiffs made the representation asserting belief in it when they did not have such belief. The defendant also pleaded that the plaintiffs were negligent in failing to inform the defendant about the nature and effect of the HDB letter prior to the execution of the Tenancy Agreement.
26        The crux of the defendant’s case was therefore that the plaintiffs knew all along from the time of purchase or, at the very least, by 6 February 2002 (when they received HDB’s letter stating that HDB was agreeable to a change of use provided that strengthening works were done) that the defendant’s use of the premises during the second tenancy would be interrupted.
27        The defendant’s explanation for suddenly vacating the premises on 24 March 2004 when he had on 18 March 2004 adopted the opposite stand that he would not vacate the premises was that he was shocked to realise from the HDB letter of 6 February 2002 that the works proposed by the plaintiffs were only necessary because the plaintiffs desired to change the use of the second storey from that of living quarters to office use. To his knowledge, the plaintiffs had all along used the second storey as their office.
28        More importantly, the letter had been forwarded to the plaintiffs’ solicitors more than a year before the commencement of the second tenancy. The defendant therefore alleged that the plaintiffs had misrepresented to him, at the time of negotiating the second tenancy, that he would be able to peacefully hold and enjoy the use of the premises for an uninterrupted period of three years. In his affidavit, the defendant claimed that if he had known that his use of the premises would be interrupted, he would never have signed the Tenancy Agreement as this would mean that he would have to incur unnecessary expenses in removing his furniture and fittings, moving his stocks, finding temporary storage for the furniture, fittings and stocks, renovating the premises and re-commencing business after the works were completed. The defendant also alleged that the plaintiffs, upon getting a tenant for a further three years at a good rental, immediately proceeded to plan and execute the works. The defendant also argued that the plaintiffs had breached the covenant for quiet enjoyment by demanding that he vacate the premises.
29        In response to the defendant’s allegations, the plaintiffs pleaded that when the Tenancy Agreement was entered into, they were of the view that no works were needed as the print-out provided by HDB at the time of purchase had stated that the property was for commercial use with an approved structural loading of 1.5kN/m². The plaintiffs only decided to carry out the strengthening works after waiting in vain from early 2002 to late 2003 for a reply from HDB which would hopefully confirm that the plaintiffs did not need to carry out any works to change the use of the second storey from living quarters to that of office use.
30        According to the plaintiffs, their letter of 9 January 2004 could not be construed as a demand for the defendant to vacate the premises. Furthermore, prior to the defendant vacating the premises, the plaintiffs and their staff had been consistently engaging the defendant or his staff in negotiations over the items the defendant would move and the compensation they would offer the defendant for the inconvenience caused by the proposed works. The first plaintiff was therefore very surprised when the defendant suddenly vacated the premises on 24 March 2004.
The evidence
31        As I have already set out the plaintiffs’ version of events at [5] to [16] above, I shall now focus on the evidence adduced from the first plaintiff during cross-examination.
32        The defendant’s solicitor argued that it was inconceivable for the plaintiffs to spend $5.6m on the basis of a print-out especially when the first plaintiff was well experienced in the sale and purchase of HDB properties, having bought several such properties previously. Nonetheless, despite his wealth of experience and the benefit of being advised by solicitors in relation to the sale and purchase of the property, the first plaintiff maintained that up until early 2002, he did not know that the second storey of the premises was for living purposes only, having used it as an office for his own business for six to seven years.
33        Another issue was whether the plaintiffs’ cause of action corresponded to the first plaintiff’s evidence that he had all along thought that the premises could be used as an office. The first plaintiff agreed that despite his insistence that there was a contradiction between the print-out provided by HDB and the lease instrument, no mention of this alleged contradiction was made in his solicitors’ letter dated 28 January 2002 to the HDB seeking change of use. He testified that he felt that there was no need to point out the contradiction as he was merely seeking to clarify the exact position. The first plaintiff denied that there was in fact to his mind no contradiction and that he had only sought to regularise his breach after his use of the second storey as an office was discovered by HDB.
34        While the first plaintiff confirmed that he would face a paper loss of over $1m in the value of the property if the change of use of the second storey from living purposes to that of commercial use was not effected, there was no deadline issued by HDB as to when the strengthening works had to be done. He testified that had the defendant refused to vacate the premises, he would have done the strengthening works after the defendant’s second tenancy ended.
35        The first plaintiff confirmed that the parties had entered into the second tenancy only after negotiations between the parties were carried out. The first plaintiff did not deny that during the negotiations up to the signing of the Tenancy Agreement, no mention was made to the defendant of the need for strengthening works to be carried out. He also admitted that the plaintiffs did not inform the defendant of the proposed upgrading works to the Ang Mo Kio town centre. However, the first plaintiff testified that the tenants of the shops around the area would have received brochures on the proposed upgrading works from the Ang Mo Kio Town Council, and that there was an exhibition showing the proposed upgrading works in the heart of Town Square, less than 100m from the property. The defendant denied however that he had seized the opportunity, as presented by the plaintiffs’ letter of 9 January 2004, to vacate the premises in view of the impending major upgrading works to the Ang Mo Kio town centre, which would, as he admitted, adversely affect the flow of customers to his shop. The defendant also denied that he knew of the upgrading works.
36        Next, I looked at the defendant’s evidence adduced in cross-examination. In contrast to the plaintiffs’ testimony, the defendant’s evidence was inconsistent and contradictory at times. I found him evasive. The concluding submissions made by counsel for the plaintiffs rightly pointed out that it was unclear from the defendant’s evidence and pleadings what was the exact representation which the plaintiffs were alleged to have made and upon which the defendant allegedly relied on and was induced thereby to enter into the second tenancy.
37        As set out above in [21], on 23 March 2004, the defendant initially said that the representation made by the plaintiffs was in failing to inform him that he would have to vacate the premises for strengthening works, thereby misleading him into signing the Tenancy Agreement. The defendant further alleged that he would not have signed the document had he been apprised of this fact. The defendant subsequently pleaded in his defence that he was entitled to rescind the contract as he was induced into entering the second tenancy by the plaintiffs’ representation that the monthly rental would be reduced from $19,000 to $17,000 and that he would be allowed the uninterrupted use and occupation of the premises for an additional period of three years.
38        Under cross-examination however, the defendant contradicted himself by testifying that he had entered into the second tenancy because he had extracted a good bargain from the plaintiffs, paying (approximately) $9,828 per month under the second tenancy as compared to $20,200 per month in the first tenancy, inclusive of Public Utilities Bill (PUB) charges amounting to $1,200 per month.
39        The defendant admitted that he was not truthful in his written testimony where he claimed that the monthly rental of $17,000 for the second tenancy was much higher than his initial offer of $15,000. Taking into account first, that he did not have to pay the monthly PUB charges of $1,200 under the second tenancy, second, that he had a rent-free month at the beginning of the second tenancy and third, that he had a subtenant who paid him a monthly rent of $5,500, the defendant agreed that he was effectively paying a monthly rental of $9,828.
40        In his affidavit, the defendant claimed that he had contacted the plaintiffs’ property agent sometime in late February or early March 2003, indicating his willingness to enter into a new tenancy if the monthly rental was reduced to $15,000 and the tenancy was granted for three years. However, the plaintiffs allegedly rejected his offer. By a letter dated 10 March 2003, he made the same offer again to the plaintiffs, informing them that he would vacate the premises at the end of March 2003 if his offer was refused. Cross-examined, the defendant’s evidence was that upon deciding to renew the tenancy, he sent the letter dated 10 March 2003 to the plaintiffs making the offer to renew. However, there was no evidence that the plaintiffs received the defendant’s letter. The address on the letter was incorrect and the defendant was unable to adduce evidence to corroborate his contention that he also faxed the letter to the plaintiffs.
41        There were other inconsistencies in the defendant’s evidence. For instance, the defendant had initially claimed that after vacating the premises, he only managed to find suitable alternative premises after a long search. Under cross-examination however, it emerged that the defendant had in fact entered into a tenancy agreement at the alleged alternative premises located at Harbourfront Mall in 2003. This was well before he vacated the plaintiffs’ premises in March 2004.
42        The defendant admitted that he held closing down sales at the property on 20 and 21 March 2004. This plainly contradicted his evidence that he only decided to vacate the premises on receiving the plaintiffs’ solicitors’ letter of 22 March 2004 which threatened to exercise the plaintiffs’ right of re-entry, as he was frightened at the prospect of being locked out of the premises. In the light of his contradictions and inconsistencies, I formed the view that the defendant was an unreliable and untruthful witness.
43        In reaching my decision, I was aware that in 
Sundara Moorthy Lankatharan v PP
 
[1997] 3 SLR 464
, the learned Yong Pung How CJ said (at [44]):
There is no rule of law that the testimony of a witness must either be believed in its entirety or not at all. A court is fully competent, for good and cogent reasons, to accept one part of the testimony of a witness and to reject the other … .
In the defendant’s case however, it was unsafe to rely on any part of his testimony.
The issues
44        There were two issues I needed to determine in this case:
(a)        Did the plaintiffs breach the covenant for quiet enjoyment, thereby repudiating the Tenancy Agreement?
(b)        If the answer to (a) was in the negative, was the defendant entitled to rescind the Tenancy Agreement based on the allegedly fraudulent misrepresentation made by the plaintiffs?
The law
Repudiation of tenancy
45        The question as to whether the contractual principle of repudiation applies to tenancies has been much debated in other common law jurisdictions. While the Court of Appeal in 
Klerk-Elias Liza v KT Chan Clinic Pte Ltd
 
[1993] 2 SLR 417
 applied the principle of repudiation to a tenancy agreement, the issue was only clarified by Warren Khoo J in 
Tan Soo Leng David v Lim Thian Chai Charles
 
[1998] 2 SLR 923
 (“
Tan Soo Leng David
”) who rightly pointed out (at [17]) that the issue emanates from the more fundamental question concerning the nature of a lease. Is it essentially a purchase of rights in real property, or is it no more than a bundle of contractual rights and obligations?
46        As Khoo J in 
Tan Soo Leng David
 concluded (at [28]), whether the rules of contract law apply to a lease depends very much on the nature of the lease in question. He said:
It seems to me there is much to be said for the application, in appropriate cases, of the contractual concept of repudiation and acceptance as a means, in addition to the traditional ones provided by common law, of bringing a lease to an end. It is particularly appropriate in the case of a lease in which the element of a purchase of an interest in land is not significant or is non-existent. In such cases, its application, together with the application of the rule about mitigation of damages, is more straightforward and is more likely to lead to a fair and equitable adjustment of the rights
 
and obligations of the parties where the
 
tenant repudiates the tenancy, than is the application of any of the common law remedies I have referred to.
47        I found that the principle of repudiation applied to the Tenancy Agreement. In the present case, the issue was whether the plaintiffs had by their letter of 9 January 2004 requiring the defendant to vacate the premises for a period of 29 days from 25 March 2004 to 22 April 2004 thereby breached the covenant for quiet enjoyment and repudiated the Tenancy Agreement.
Covenant for quiet enjoyment
48        The covenant for quiet enjoyment operates to secure the lessee not merely in the possession, but also in the employment of the premises for all usual purposes; and where the ordinary and lawful enjoyment of the demised premises is substantially interfered with by the acts or omission of the lessor or those lawfully claiming under him, the covenant is broken.
49        In 
Kenny v Preen
 
[1963] 1 QB 499
, Pearson LJ in the Court of Appeal said (at 511):
The implied covenant for quiet enjoyment is not an absolute covenant protecting a tenant against eviction or interference by anybody, but is a qualified covenant protecting the tenant against interference with the tenant’s quiet and peaceful possession and enjoyment of the premises by the landlord or persons claiming through or under the landlord. The basis of it is that the landlord, by letting the premises, confers on the tenant the right of possession during the term and impliedly promises not to interfere with the tenant’s exercise and use of the right of possession during the term. I think the word “enjoy” used in this connection is a translation of the Latin word “fruor” and refers to the exercise and use of the right and having the full benefit of it, rather than to deriving pleasure from it.
50        It was previously thought that a covenant for quiet enjoyment is only breached if the title or possession of the land is affected. However, in 
Harrison, Ainslie & Co v Muncaster
 
[1891] 2 QB 680
, the UK Court of Appeal held that (at 684):
Formerly it was thought that a covenant for quiet enjoyment only applied to an interference with the title of the covenantee, but upon more careful consideration it was held that it applied to an interference with the enjoyment of the thing demised; and it seems clear that there may be an interference with the enjoyment of property without any interruption to or interference with the title to it
51        Whether this interference has taken place is, in each case, a question of fact. In 
Owen v Gadd
 
[1956] 2 QB 99
, the UK Court of Appeal said (at 105):
The question whether the quiet enjoyment of the premises demised has been interrupted or not is in every case one of fact; and the covenant is broken although neither the title to the land nor the possession of the land may be otherwise affected, where the ordinary and lawful enjoyment is substantially interfered with by the acts of the lessor or of those lawfully claiming under him.
52        It is clear that a tenant is not obliged to wait until the landlord changes the locks of his premises before he can claim that the landlord has repudiated the tenancy. As Lord Evershed MR in the same case opined (at 107):
It was said by Mr. Chapman that we must further qualify the language of Fry L.J. and that there could be no breach of the covenant for quiet enjoyment unless there was what he called an actual physical irruption into or upon the premises demised on the part of the landlords or some persons authorized by them by their actually entering upon or invading the premises, or by, e.g., the irruption thereon of water emitted from the landlords’ premises elsewhere. In my judgment, that submission is not justified by the authorities.
53        However, as the authors of 
Hill & Redman’s
 
Law of Landlord and Tenant
 (John Furber gen ed) (LexisNexis Butterworths, Looseleaf Ed, September 2003 release) rightly noted (at A1857), the mere likelihood of interruption is not enough. Hence, in 
Howard v Maitland
 (1883) 11 QB 695, the UK Court of Appeal held that there had been no breach of the covenant for quiet enjoyment although a judgment had been obtained subjecting the land to a right in common, as there was no entry on, or actual disturbance of, the lessee. Brett MR opined (at 700):
Therefore there having been no absolute interference with the plaintiff’s actual enjoyment of this land until the property in it was taken away from him by the Epping Forest Act, 1878, it seems to me that there was no disturbance which could entitle him to maintain this action.
54        The law as regards the covenant for quiet enjoyment is therefore that to amount to a breach, there must be some interference with the enjoyment of the demised premises. The interference need not be direct or physical so long as it substantially interferes with the title to or possession of the demised premises or the ordinary and lawful enjoyment of those premises by the tenant.
55        In 
Manchester, Sheffield & Lincolnshire Railway Company v Anderson
 
[1898] 2 Ch 394
 (“
Manchester
”), the defendant pleaded that the plaintiff company had breached the covenant for quiet enjoyment as works done by the plaintiff company had resulted in structural injury to his house and had also for some time rendered the access to his premises less convenient. In response, Lindley MR said (at 401):
I will only add a few words about the covenant for quiet enjoyment because counsel for the defendant urged us to go to an extent rather alarming to real property lawyers. I take it that a mere temporary inconvenience caused by a lessor, not in depriving his tenant of a right of way, but in rendering his access less convenient than it was, is not a breach of covenant for quiet enjoyment. A temporary inconvenience which does not interfere with the estate or title or possession is not, to my mind, a breach of covenant, nor is there any case that goes anything like the length required to shew that it is. … But to say that partly blocking up a public street, which is an inconvenience to the public and an inconvenience to any one residing near the place, is a breach of covenant for quiet enjoyment, is going far beyond any authority I am aware of.
56        In 
Phelps v City of London Corporation
 
[1916] 2 Ch 255
 (“
Phelps
”), the plaintiff claimed that he was entitled to relief against a nuisance or breach of the covenant for quiet enjoyment and sought to restrain the construction works being carried out by the defendant. Peterson J said (at 267):
The last complaint which the plaintiff puts forward is founded on noise; he claims to be entitled to relief against a nuisance or against a breach of the covenant for quiet enjoyment. So far as nuisance is concerned, it is temporary and does not constitute a cause of action: 
Harrison
 v. 
Southwark and Vauxhall Water Co
 
[1891] 2 Ch. 409
. Moreover, a temporary inconvenience, such as this, is not a breach of the covenant for quiet enjoyment: 
Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Ry. Co. v Anderson
 
[1898] 2 Ch 394
, 401; and it is at least doubtful whether a nuisance by noise is a breach of such a covenant: 
Jenkins
 v. 
Jackson
 40 Ch. D. 71.
57        Counsel for the plaintiffs argued that these authorities stand for the proposition that a temporary inconvenience does not amount to a breach of the covenant for quiet enjoyment. While I agree with the decisions in those cases, I am of the view that the facts in 
Manchester
 and 
Phelps
 are very different from those at hand and do not stand for the proposition which counsel claims they do.
58        Indeed, the breach of the covenant for quiet enjoyment can be of a temporary nature so long as the interference is substantial. In 
Budd-Scott v Daniell
 
[1902] 2 KB 351
, the defendant succeeded in her counterclaim for breach of an implied covenant for quiet enjoyment as she had to move out of the house for two weeks during the tenancy agreement to allow the plaintiff, who was obligated under a private Act of Parliament, to paint the house.
59        I come to the last line of cases where courts have found that there has been a breach of the covenant for quiet enjoyment where landlords have either by threatening behaviour or words sought to evict their tenants. In 
Sampson v Floyd
 
[1989] 2 EGLR 49
, the tenant left the premises after fighting with the landlord on three occasions. The landlord had used abusive language demanding that the tenant leave the premises and on the last occasion, the tenant’s wife had been so terrified that she hid underneath one of the caravans. The UK Court of Appeal said:
It is, however, clear that eviction need not be physical. If the landlord’s conduct was such as to frighten the plaintiff, both on his behalf and on his wife’s behalf, then there was an eviction.
60        In 
Kenny v Preen
 ([49] 
supra
), the UK Court of Appeal found that the acts of the landlord amounted to a breach of the covenant for quiet enjoyment on the basis that it amounted to a direct physical interference with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises. I agree with Pearson LJ who opined (at 510–511):
In this case the landlord was asserting that the tenant’s title, her right to possession of the premises, although initially valid, had been wholly determined by a notice to quit. In my judgment, a landlord by merely making that assertion, however wrong he may be, does not commit a breach of covenant. He is entitled to make that assertion, at any rate if he believes it to be true, frequently, emphatically and even rudely. He is entitled also to threaten proceedings in the courts for possession and damages.
In the present case, however, there was much more than that. The landlord evaded answering the solicitors’ letters raising the tenant’s defences to his claim. He concentrated his attention on the tenant herself and tried, by a series of threatening communications, to drive her out of her possession of the premises. The threats were not merely of legal proceedings: there were threats of physical eviction of the tenant and removal of her belongings. Moreover, there was an element of direct physical interference by repeatedly knocking on the door and shouting the threats to her. That element of direct physical interference was not trivial but substantial in this case, because it was persisted in and because it has to be seen against the background of the threatening letters.
61        I was of the view that the plaintiffs’ conduct could not be said to amount to a substantial interference with the defendant’s use and enjoyment of the premises. Prior to the defendant’s sudden move on 24 March 2004, the plaintiffs were engaged in negotiations with the defendant as to when the defendant would move out and how the plaintiffs would compensate the defendant for the resultant inconveniences of the proposed works. Admittedly, the first plaintiff did not agree to most of the defendant’s requests. Nonetheless, I was satisfied that the plaintiffs had no intention of evicting the defendant out of the premises by their letter of 9 January 2004 [12]. While the plaintiffs’ solicitors’ letter of 22 March 2004 threatened to exercise the plaintiffs’ right of re-entry, this was in relation to their claims against the defendant for the outstanding rental for the months of February and March 2004, which the defendant admitted during cross-examination that he had deliberately refused to pay. Further, as mentioned above in [42], I disbelieved the defendant’s evidence that he was frightened at the prospect of being locked-out upon receiving this letter as he had already held closing down sales prior to receiving this letter. He was in no way threatened by the plaintiffs’ letters.
62        I therefore formed the view that the defendant was the one who, by vacating the premises, had repudiated the Tenancy Agreement.
Fraudulent misrepresentation
63        The law on fraudulent misrepresentation was considered by our Court of Appeal in 
Panatron Pte Ltd v Lee Cheow Lee
 
[2001] 3 SLR 405
 at:
13         The law as regards fraudulent representation is clear. Since the case of 
Pasley v Freeman
 (1789) 3 Term Rep 51, it has been settled that a person can be held liable in tort to another, if he knowingly or recklessly makes a false statement to that other with the intent that it would be acted upon, and that other does act upon it and suffers damage. This came to be known as the tort of deceit. In 
Derry v Peek
 
(1889) 14 App Cas 337
 the tort was further developed. It was held that in an action of deceit the plaintiff must prove actual fraud. This fraud is proved only when it is shown that a false representation has been made knowingly, or without belief in its truth, or recklessly, without caring whether it be true or false.
14         The essentials of this tort have been set out by Lord Maugham in 
Bradford Building Society v Borders
 [1941] 2 All ER 205. Basically there are the following elements. First, there must be a representation of fact made by words or conduct. Second, the representation must be made with the intention that it should be acted upon by the plaintiff, or by a class of persons which includes the plaintiff. Third, it must be proved that the plaintiff
 
had acted upon the false statement. Fourth, it must be proved that the plaintiff suffered damage by so doing.
 
Fifth, the representation must be made with knowledge that it is false; it must be wilfully false, or at least made in the absence of any genuine belief that it is true.
64        The first question I considered was whether the plaintiffs had indeed made a representation to the defendant. The defendant claimed that the plaintiffs fraudulently represented that he would have the uninterrupted use and occupation of the premises for an additional period of three years despite being aware of the fact that works would have to be done during the second tenancy. As Andrew Phang in his book 
Cheshire, Fifoot and Furmston’s
 Law of Contract (Singapore and Malaysian Edition) rightly opines (at p 412):
Silence upon some of the relevant factors may obviously distort a positive assertion. A party to a contract may be legally justified in remaining silent about some material fact, but if he ventures to make a representation upon the matter it must be a full and frank statement, and not such a partial and fragmentary account that what is withheld makes that which is said absolutely false. A half-truth may be in fact false because of what it leaves unsaid, and, although what a man actually says may be true in every detail, he is guilty of misrepresentation unless he tells the whole truth.
65
       
 However, I found that the plaintiffs made no such representation to the defendant. The defendant had the burden of proving that the plaintiffs had in fact made a representation, which he failed to discharge. Even if I was wrong in reaching this conclusion, the defendant could not succeed as he was not induced to enter into the contract by the plaintiffs’ alleged misrepresentation.
66        A representation does not render a contract voidable unless it was intended to cause and has in fact caused the representee to make the contract. In 
Smith v Chadwick
 (1882) 20 Ch D 27, the plaintiff frankly admitted in cross-examination that although the company’s prospectus listed a certain important person as being a director of the company, he had been in no degree influenced by this misstatement in purchasing the company’s shares. This was similar to the facts of the present case where the defendant admitted under cross-examination that he had entered into the second tenancy as he got a good bargain paying a greatly reduced rent as compared to what he had paid under the first tenancy. Accordingly, the defendant’s defence failed
Conclusion
67        For the reasons set out earlier, I found no merits in the defendant’s defence or counterclaim. Consequently, I awarded interlocutory judgment to the plaintiffs with costs, and directed that damages be assessed by the Registrar with the costs thereof reserved to the Registrar.",2005-09-01 00:00:00,SG High Court

 July at about 9.00 pm by Sergeant Tan Mia Kwang of Ang Mo Kio Police Division.  It was revealed that the accused would pick up the above-mentioned items at the residential blocks when he asked the taxi-drivers to stop and wait for him.
26        There was no restitution made by the accused.  Accused is charged accordingly.
Mitigation Plea
27        The defence counsel submitted a mitigation plea (Exhibit D1) At an early age, the accused was without his father as the latter had left the family.  The accused was involved with the wrong company and started on drugs which led to his detention and incarceration in 2001 and 2002.  The accused’s wife took his two children and left him for another man.The accused was depressed and in order to suppress his urge on drugs, he saw his doctor for sleeping pills.  It was in those circumstances that the accused committed the present offences.  The accused pleaded for a minimum custodial sentence as he is prepared to start a new life and put the whole incident behind him.  He is also prepared to make full restitution to the victims involved.        
Sentence
28        In deciding on the sentence, I considered the accused’s mitigation plea and that he had pleaded guilty to the five cheating charges.  The accused also consented to the remaining twenty seven charges ( nine cheating charges and eighteen charges for hiring taxis without paying for the taxi fare) to be taken into consideration.
29        It is clear that the accused was committing the series of offences repeatedly without due regard to the anguish and plight of the taxi drivers..  He was going on a cheating spree and had consistently hired taxis without paying for the taxi fare on eighteen occasions! The accused’s victims were all taxi drivers and they were deprived of their earnings as a result of the accused’s deceit.  I was of the view that a deterrent sentence was appropriate in the circumstances to protect taxi drivers from unscrupulous commuters like the accused.
30        In PP v Tan Fook Sum 
[1999] 2 SLR 523
, the remarks of Hilbery J in R v Ball (1951) 35 Cr App R 164 at pp 165-166 were cited with approval:
“In deciding the appropriate sentence, a court should always be guided by certain considerations. The first and foremost is the public interest.The criminal law is publicly enforced, not only with the object of punishing crime, but also in the hope of preventing it. A proper sentence, passed in public, serves the public interest in two ways. It might deter others who might be tempted to try crime as seeming to offer easy money on the supposition, that if the offender is caught and brought to justice, the punishment will be negligible. Such a sentence may also deter the particular criminal from committing a crime again, or induce him to turn from a criminal to an honest life. The public interest is indeed served, and best served, if the offender is induced to turn from criminal ways to honest living.”
31        In Xia Qin Lai v PP 
[1999] 4 SLR 343
 at [29], the Chief Justice said:
“ In short,the principle of deterrence (especially general deterrence) dictated that the length of the custodial sentence awarded had to be a not insubstantial one, in order to drive home the message to other like-minded persons that such offences will not be tolerated, but not so much as to be unjust in the circumstances of the case.”   
32        In the case of 
R Vincent v Public Prosecutor
 
[Magistrates Appeal
 
333/1994/01],
 the accused/appellant pleaded guilty to two cheating charges and ten other charges for various offences.  In that case, the accused had deceived Bangladeshi nationals into believing that they could find legitimate employment with valid work permits in Singapore when in fact he could not do so.  He was sentenced to three years imprisonment for each cheating charge and this was affirmed upon an appeal to the High Court.  Although the accused had a previous conviction for cheating by impersonation, the sentences imposed reflect the gravity of the offences. 
In 
Ang Jee Ping v Public Prosecutor
 
[Magistrates Appeal No.147/2001/1],
 the accused pleaded guilty to two cheating charges for deceiving the United Overseas Bank Card Centre into crediting certain purchases to Advance Acoustics Pte Ltd by using counterfeit credit cards.  The accused was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment for each of the two charges with the sentences to run consecutively. 
33        In the present case, the accused had a string of previous convictions on drug offences between 2001 to 2003(Exhibit ‘C’).  Moreover, although he had pleaded guilty to five cheating charges, nine other cheating charges and eighteen charges for refusing to pay the taxi fare without lawful excuse, an offence under section 23(5) of the Public Transport Council Act(Cap.259B) were taken into consideration.  Taking all the circumstances, I imposed a sentence of eighteen months imprisonment for each of the five charges proceeded with.  I also ordered the sentences for the first charge (DAC 27943/05 – Exhibit P1A) and the third charge (DAC 29221/05 – Exhibit P2A) to run consecutively.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Negligence.—Findings of jury.—Contributory negligence.

In an action founded on personal injuries caused by a street
car the jury found that defendants’ negligence was the cause of the accident
and also that plaintiff had been negligent in not looking out for the car.

Held, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal (2
Ont. L.R. 53) that as the charge to the jury had properly explained the law as
to contributory negligence the latter finding must be considered to mean that
the accident would not have occurred but for the plaintiff’s own negligence and
he could not recover.

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1]
reversing the judgment of the Divisional Court in favour of the defendant and
ordering a new trial.

The facts in this case are as follows:

The plaintiff was a mechanic returning from work to his home,
about half-past five in the evening. He came to the corner of Colborne and
Dundas Streets, in the City of London (Dundas Street being the main
thoroughfare of the city, largely travelled, and shaded at this section with
shade trees). Before starting across the road, going south, the plaintiff
looked to his left (being towards the east) for a car and saw none. He then
started to cross the street, diagonally, towards the south-west, being unable
to go directly south owing

[Page 643]

to repairs and obstructions in the highway. He had just reached
the track when he was struck by a car of the defendant Company.

On the second trial of the action against the Street Railway
Company for damages there was contradictory evidence as to the rate of speed at
which the car was going at the time of the accident and also as to whether or
not the bell was rung so as to warn the plaintiff of its approach. The jury’s
findings were as follows:

I. Were the defendants guilty of negligence? Yes.

II. If so, in what the negligence consist? Running at too high a
rate of speed and not properly sounding the gong, also not having the car under
proper control.

III. If the defendants were negligent was the injury to the
plaintiff caused by their negligence? Yes.

IV. Was the plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence? Yes.

V. If so, in what does negligence consist? In not using more
caution in crossing the railway tracks.

VI. Might the defendants’ servants, after the position of the
plaintiff became apparent, by the exercise of reasonable care have prevented
the accident? No.

VII. At what sum to you assess the plaintiff’s damages? Six
hundred dollars.

On these findings the trial judge, Meredith C.J., ordered a
verdict to be rendered for the defendants which was afterwards affirmed by the
Divisional Court. The Court of Appeal reversed the latter judgment and set the
verdict aside ordering a third trial of the action. The defendant company
appealed to this court.

Hellmuth for the appellant.

Gibbons K.C. for the respondent.

TASCHEREAU J.—In my opinion this appeal should be allowed.

[Page 644]

GWYNNE J.—This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario, reversing a judgment rendered in favour of the defendants upon a
trial before Meredith C.J. and ordering another trial of the case to be had.
The case had been brought down to trial before when the jury having been unable
to agree were dismissed and a second trial was ordered, at which trial,
judgment having been entered for the defendants in accordance with the finding
of the facts by the jury, the defendants insist that they are entitled in law
to retain that judgment.

The action is for an injury sustained by the plaintiff
occasioned, as he alleges, by the negligence of the defendants’ servants in
managing a street railway car running on Dundas street in the City of London,
when the plaintiff was crossing the street on foot.

The plaintiff, having been examined as a witness on his own
behalf, said that on the twentieth of July, 1899, he was going home from his
work as a carpenter, and walked down the east side of Colborne street to where
that street is crossed at right angles by Dundas street. That when he reached
the curb-stone there at the north-east angle of Dundas and Colborne streets he
stepped on to the street and looked round and saw no car on the railway and
heard no bell, and that although within fourteen feet of the railway track on
the ordinary footpath across the street in continuation of the sidewalk on
Colborne street which he had come down he immediately started to cross Dundas
street diagonally to the south-west corner of Dundas and Colborne streets, and
that when he had proceeded but half way, that is to say, about forty-five or
fifty feet, he was struck on the left shoulder by a street railway car
proceeding from east to west.

Another witness, called by the plaintiff, named Joseph Waugh, was
engaged in dumping gravel on the side-

[Page 645]

walk at the said north-east corner, when the plaintiff arrived
there. This witness saw him enter on the street from the curb-stone and proceed
diagonally across Dundas street. Witness immediately, while dumping his gravel,
heard some one exclaim “they have killed a man.” Whereupon witness turned and
saw the plaintiff down on the street. Witness says that until then he heard no
gong but that then the gong began to ring vigourously. Witness said that a car
had just before passed going from the west to the east and that he heard no
gong from it either, although he had passed close to it when hauling the gravel
to the said north-east corner. He said also that the car which struck the
plaintiff was running very fast, at a rate which he judged to be eighteen or
twenty miles an hour. He said that his reason for saying that rate was the
distance the car ran after the accident before it was stopped, which distance,
he says, was the whole length of a block, where it reached a house called the
Gustier House. Being asked how far the place where the car was stopped was from
the place where the plaintiff was struck, he said, he would judge it to be one
hundred and fifty or may be, two hundred yards, (that is to say, from
four hundred and fifty to six hundred feet). Now, another witness called for
the plaintiff, named John McLean, testified that he was standing at the
sidewalk on the north-west corner of Dundas and Colborne streets when
the plaintiff stepped from the curb stone on to the street at the north-west
corner; that while the plaintiff was there, a street car passed coming from the
west, ringing its gong, and went on east, and at the same time, witness saw the
car coming from the east; that the plaintiff, immediately upon his entering on
to the street from the curb-stone, proceeded diagonally across the street and
just as he reached the centre of Dundas and Colborne streets and was about to
put

[Page 646]

his foot upon the railway, he was struck by the right hand corner
of the car which the witness had seen coming from the east; had one step been
then withheld, the accident could not have happened. The gong, he says, of that
car may have been ringing before the plaintiff was struck but witness was very
much excited, as he said, and did not notice it, but when the plaintiff was
struck it was ringing violently. This witness also judged of the speed at which
the car was running, to be from fifteen to eighteen miles an hour, from the
distance which it ran before it was stopped, which the witness also put near the
Gustier House, which he estimated to be probably, three hundred feet
from where the accident had occurred.

Another witness called by the plaintiff testified that he also
was at the north-east angle of Dundas and Colborne streets when he saw the
plaintiff start diagonally across the street. Witness immediately turned to
pick up his dinner bucket and, as he did so, saw the car coming and, instantly,
he heard the crashing of tools, (in a bag which the plaintiff carried on his
shoulder). He says he did not hear the gong until he heard the crash of the
tools.

From all this evidence it is clear that the plaintiff was struck
almost instantaneously after his starting from the curb-stone on the north-east
corner of Dundas and Colborne streets, during which time the car, as testified
to by McLean, was plainly visible, coming from the east.

Now, on the part of the defence, the motorman and the conductor
both swore that the gong was rung when the car had reached within from
seventy-five to one hundred feet of Colborne street, and the motorman added
that the car was going at the ordinary rate of about eight miles an hour and
that it was stopped

[Page 647]

within three cars length; that is, within one hundred feet from
his applying the brakes.

A witness named Carrie Grantham, who lived on Dundas street and
knew, as she said, the locality well, and was on the car at the time, testified
that as the car approached Colborne street the gong was ringing and that,
immediately before the accident, it was ringing vigourously and, while it was
so ringing, she felt the shock of the accident. Of this she entertained no
doubt. She also testified that she observed the place where the car stopped,
and that this was a long distance east of the Gustier House and that, as well
as she could judge, the car had not gone quite a quarter of a block from where
the accident occurred until it was stopped. What the length of the block was,
was not asked and did not appear.

Now, upon this evidence the jury, upon a charge to which the
plaintiff has no just ground of complaint, have found that the injury suffered
by the plaintiff was due to negligence of which the defendants were guilty in
running at too high a rate of speed and not properly ringing the gong and not
having the car under proper control, and that the plaintiff himself was guilty
of contributory negligence in not using more caution in crossing the railway
tracks and that the defendants’ servants could not, after the position of the
plaintiff became apparent, have by the exercise of reasonable care prevented
the accident.

The finding of the jury, upon the question of the plaintiff’s own
negligence having contributed to the accident, is much more in accord with the
evidence than was their finding upon the question as to the defendants’ negligence,
the evidence offered upon which question was, it must be admitted, of a most
contradictory and not very satisfactory character.

[Page 648]

Upon the above findings the learned Chief Justice rendered
judgment for the defendants dismissing the action.

The Court of Appeal for Ontario has reversed that judgment and
ordered another trial, upon the ground, that they thought the finding of the
jury upon the question of the contributory negligence of the plaintiff not
satisfactory.

Now, that question, and what would constitute contributory
negligence, appears in nearly two hundred pages of printed matter in the case
before us to have been so very fully and clearly explained by the learned Chief
Justice to the jury in a charge to which the plaintiff can have no reasonable
ground of complaint, that we can see no reason to doubt that the jury in
finding the plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence meant that the
plaintiff was guilty of negligence without which, notwithstanding the
negligence of which they found the defendants guilty, the accident could not
have occurred, and in so finding, they were acting in accordance with the
explanation of the term “contributory negligence” as explained to them by the
learned Chief Justice, in his charge.

That finding was, we think, most fully justified by the evidence,
and with a finding of the jury in perfect accord with the evidence upon that
point, we do not think that the defendants should be remitted to the third
trial in this case.

The appeal must therefore be allowed with costs and the judgment
of the learned Chief Justice at the trial restored.

SEDGEWICK and GIROUARD JJ. concurred in the judgment allowing the
appeal.

[Page 649]

DAVIES J.—This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario directing a new trial of the action and reversing the
judgment of Chief Justice Meredith before whom the cause was tried, who had
ordered judgment to be entered for the defendant. The action was brought for
the recovery of damages for injuries sustained by the plaintiff owing to the
alleged negligence of the appellants when attempting to cross the street
railway track in the City of London.

The learned Chief Justice submitted to the jury a series of
questions all of which were answered, and it was upon these answers that he
directed the verdict to be entered for the defendants, the now appellants.

The questions and answers were as follows:

1. Were the defendants guilty of negligence?

A. Yes.

2. If so, in what did the negligence consist?

A. Running at too high a rate of speed and not properly
sounding the gong, also not having the car under proper control.

3. If the defendants were negligent was the injury to the
plaintiff caused by their negligence?

A. Yes.

4. Was the plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence?

A. Yes.

5. If so, in what does his negligence consist?

A. In not using more caution in crossing the railway tracks.

6. Might the defendants’ servants, after the position of the
plaintiff became apparent, by the exercise of reasonable care, have prevented
the accident?

A. No.

7. At what sum to you assess the plaintiff’s damages?

A. Six hundred dollars.

The learned judges of the Court of Appeal in Ontario thought that
the findings of the jury were inconsistent.

Mr. Justice Osier in his opinion, in which Mr. Justice Moss
concurred, says:

The express finding of the jury that the plaintiff’s injury
was caused by the specific acts of negligence of which the defendants were
guilty

[Page 650]

makes it to my mind almost impossible to attribute to their
further finding that the plaintiff should have used more caution in crossing
the track the legal result of a finding of contributory negligence;

while Mr. Justice Lister found the finding of the jury “confused
and unsatisfactory.”

But if there is an apparent confusion and uncertainty or even of
repugnance in the several findings of the jury, it will be found I think on a
closer examination that it is only apparent and not real, and that it is to
some extent inseparable from all findings, both of negligence on the
defendants’ part and contributory negligence on the plaintiff’s. It would have
perhaps been more satisfactory if the jury had pointed out more specifically
the want of caution shewn by the plaintiff in crossing the track, but read as
the answer must be in light of the evidence given at the trial and of the
charge of the learned judge, there cannot be any doubt as to its meaning.

The findings of the jury on the whole amount to this, that while
the accident would not have happened but for the negligence of the appellants,
neither would it but for the negligence of the respondent, the plaintiff below.
The learned Chief Justice in a comprehensive charge to the jury, in which he
minutely reviewed all the facts, pointed out to them the nature of contributory
negligence and its effect upon the plaintiff’s action if found. The jury found
specifically on evidence, which I think warranted the finding, that the
plaintiff had been guilty of contributory negligence, and in answer to the next
question say it consisted in want of caution in crossing the tracks. Read in
the light of the facts as disclosed in the evidence, there can be no doubt as
to the meaning of these answers. They find in effect that the plaintiff in
crossing the track was careless and negligent, and did not take such ordinary
precautions as a reasonable and prudent man under the circumstances should have
taken. It is

[Page 651]

equally true as found by them that the appellants were guilty of
negligence in the running of their cars at the time and that but for such
negligence the accident would not have occurred. But the rule of law in all
such cases is too firmly established to admit of any doubt. Even if the
accident is attributable in the first instance to the defendants’ negligence,
if it would not have occurred but for the negligence of the plaintiff himself
he cannot recover.

The questions were peculiarly those proper for the consideration
of a jury. They have found as stated above, after a full and fair trial and
after having had the benefit of a carefully considered explanation of the law
on the subject from the learned trial judge, a charge, the correctness of
which, too, is not now challenged. I can see therefore no justification for
sending the case back for further trial.

The case of Rowan v. Toronto Railway Co.[2]
referred to in the judgments below, does not seem to me to have any special
application to the case now under review for the simple reason that in that
case there was no finding of the jury specifically of contributory negligence
as there is here.

The respondent’s counsel, both in his factum and in his oral
argument before this court, pressed very strongly the contention that the sixth
question could have been put in an altogether different form and that the
evidence shewed the negligence of the defendants’ servants to have been so
gross that no exercise of care on their part could have prevented the accident
after the plaintiff’s position on the track was discovered and that they
therefore must be held liable. In support of this proposition he relied upon a
statement made by Mr. Smith in his book on the law of negligence. But for
this statement no authority was cited by Mr.

[Page 652]

Smith, and it does not seem to me at any rate applicable to a
case such as this where the jury have really found that the accident would not
have occurred but for the plaintiff’s negligence. If any such doctrine could be
invoked to destroy the legal consequence of a negligent act or want of action
which was the proximate cause of the injury complained of, it would go far to destroy
the doctrine of contributory negligence altogether.

I think the appeal should be allowed with costs and the judgment
of the learned Chief Justice restored.

Appeal allowed with costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME
COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA.

Criminal law—Indictment
against body corporate—Crim. Code, s. 213—Fine.

Under sec. 213 of the Criminal
Code  a corporation may be indicted for omitting, without lawful excuse, to
perform the duty of avoiding danger to human life from anything in its charge
or under its control.

The fact that the consequence
of the omission to perform such duty might have justified an indictment for
manslaughter in the case of an individual is not a ground for quashing the
indictment.

As sec. 213 provides no
punishment for the offence the common law punishment of a fine may be imposed
on a corporation indicted under it.

APPEAL from a decision of the
Supreme Court of British Columbia[1]
affirming the conviction of the app nt company on a case reserved.

The company was indicted for
unlawfully causing the death of certain persons by neglecting to properly
maintain a bridge over which certain trains were run when a train broke
through. At the trial a verdict of guilty was entered and a case was reserved
for the opinion of the Court of Appeal on the question whether or not the
indictment would lie against a corporation. The reserved case is set out in the
judgment of Mr. Justice Sedgewick speaking for the majority of the court.

The judgment of the majority of
the court was delivered by:

SEDGEWICK J.—This is an appeal
from a judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, upon a reserved case
stated by Mr. Justice Walkem for the consideration of the court, the defendants
having been convicted and sentenced to pay a fine of $5,000. Upon the appeal
the court was equally divided. The following is the reserved case :

The defendants were tried
and convicted at the fall assizes, at Victoria, before the Honourable Mr.
Justice Walkem and a jury, under the following indictment :

CANADA : PROVINCE OF BRITISH
COLUMBIA, COUNTY OF NANAIMO, CITY OF NANAIMO.

The jurors for our Lady the Queen
present that the ""Union Colliery Company of British Columbia, Limited
Liability,"" is a company duly incorporated under the ""Companies Act,
1878,"" for the purpose, amongst other things, of acquiring coal lands in
the Province of British Columbia, of extracting the coal therefrom, and of
erecting and using tramways and roadways necessary for transporting said coal
from the mines to the place of shipment.

The jurors aforesaid do
further present that the said company, pursuant to the said powers, have for a
long time past been mining coal near Union, in the County of Nanaimo, in the
Province of British Columbia, and have been transporting said coal from said
mines to Union Wharf, in said county, the place of shipment thereof, along a
tramway or railway, in cars drawn by locomotives.

The jurors aforesaid do
further present that the said tramway or railway is about ten miles in length,
and that for some time past the company has been carrying passengers as well as
hauling coal on said tramway or railway, between said points.

The jurors aforesaid do
further present that the said tramway or railway, on the day and year
hereinafter mentioned, was carried across the valley of the Trent River by
trestle-work and a Howe truss bridge erected several years prior to said date,
which truss bridge was about one hundred and thirty-three feet in length, and
about 

[Page 83]

ninety-five feet above the
bed of the said river, and that the said trestle-work and truss bridge were
maintained by the said company.

The jurors aforesaid do
further present that in the absence of reasonable precaution and care the said
Howe truss bridge might endanger human life, and that the said company were
under a legal duty to take reasonable precautions against and to use reasonable
care to avoid such danger.

The jurors aforesaid do
further present that the said company unlawfully neglected, without lawful
excuse, to take reasonable precautions and to use reasonable care in
maintaining the said Howe truss bridge, and that on the seventeenth day of
August, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and ninety-eight, a
locomotive engine and several cars, then being run along said tramway or
railway and across said Howe truss bridge by said company, broke down said Howe
truss bridge, owing to the rotten state of the timbers thereof, and were
precipitated into the valley of the Trent River, thereby causing the death of
Alfred Walker, Richard Nightingale, Walter Work, Alexander Mellodo, K. Nanko
(Japanese), and Osana (Japanese), who were then on said cars and locomotive,
against the form of the statute in such case made and provided, and against the
peace of our Lady the Queen, Her Crown and dignity.

The question reserved for
the opinion of the court is :—Will the indictment lie against a corporation? If
this question be answered in the negative, the conviction is to be quashed ;
otherwise, the conviction is to stand.

A verdict of guilty having been
found against the defendants upon the indictment above set out, we must assume
that all the facts therein stated are correct. And they are substantially as
follows: The company in pursuance of its corporate powers had for a long time
past been operating a railway for the purpose of transporting coal from their
mines to a place of shipment by means of locomotives, and whether in pursuance
of their corporate powers or not, they, as a matter of fact, were
engaged in the carrying of passengers, holding themselves out as common
carriers by railway. The road crossed the Trent River by means of a bridge 130
feet in length and 90 feet above the river bed. The company neglecting to use
reasonable care in maintaining the bridge so that it 

[Page 84]

became unsafe, ran a train
carrying passengers across it, which train broke through owing to the rotten
state of its timbers, causing the death of six persons then being on the train.
And the sole question for our consideration is whether these facts constitute a
criminal offence, whether by statute or at common law.

It was at one time thought that a
private corporation could not commit torts or be held liable for the wrongful
acts of its officers or agents, but this view has long since been exploded. A
similar notion obtained in early times as to the criminal liability of a
corporation, but it has long since been settled that they are liable to
indictment for non-feasance, or for negligence in the performance of a legal
duty. It was not until 1846 that their liability for misfeasance or active
negligence was determined to be subject to like proceeding. In the case of The
Queen v. The Great North of England Railway Co.[2],
in 1846, Lord Denman C.J. in delivering the judgment of the court, said, at p.
325 :

The question is, whether an
indictment will lie at common law against a corporation for a misfeasance, it
being admitted, in conformity with undisputed decisions, that an indictment may
be maintained against a corporation for non-feasance. * * * * But the argument
is, that for the wrongful act a corporation is not amenable to an indictment,
though for a wrongful omission it undoubtedly is ; assuming in the first place,
that there is a plain and obvious distinction between the two species of
offence.

No assumption can be more
unfounded. Many occurrences may be easily conceived, full of annoyance and danger
to the public, and involving blame in some individual or some corporation, of
which the most acute person could not clearly define the cause, or ascribe them
with more correctness to more negligence in providing safeguards or to an act
rendered improper by nothing but the want of safeguards. If A. is authorised to
make a bridge with parapets, but makes it without them, does the offence
consist in the construction of the unsecured bridge, or in the neglect to
secure it ?

[Page 85]

But if the distinction were
always easily discoverable, why should a corporation be liable for the one
species of offence and not for the other? The startling incongruity of allowing
the exemption is one strong argument against it. The law is often entangled in
technical embarrassments ; but there is none here. It is as easy to charge one
person, or a body corporate, with erecting a bar across a public road as with
non-repair of it ; and they may as well be compelled to pay a fine for the act
as for the omission.

This case has been followed on
many occasions, and cited with approval in the House of Lords. In the case of Whitfield
v. South Eastern Railway Co.[3],
Lord Campbell held that a railway company might be sued for a malicious libel,
and in the course of his judgment says :

The ground on which it is
contended that an action for a libel cannot possibly be maintained against a
corporation aggregate fails. But, considering that an action of tort or of
trespass will lie against a corporation aggregate, and that an indictment may be
preferred against a corporation aggregate both for commission and omission, to
be followed up by fine, although not by imprisonment, there may be great
difficulty in saying that under certain circumstances express malice may not be
imputed to and proved against a corporation. The authorities are connected and
commented upon in Regina v. Great North of England Railway Company[4],
in which it was held that a corporation aggregate may be indicted for cutting
through and obstructing a public highway.

And in the Pharmaceutical Society
v. London & Provincial Supply Association[5], Lord
Blackburn says, at p. 869:

I quite agree that a
corporation cannot in one sense commit a crime —a corporation cannot be
imprisoned, if imprisonment be the sentence for the crime ; a corporation
cannot be hanged or put to death if that be the punishment for the crime ; and
so, in those senses a corporation cannot commit a crime. But a corporation may
be fined, and a corporation may pay damages; and therefore I must totally
dissent, notwithstanding what Lord Justice Bramwell said, or is reported to
have said, upon the supposition that a body corporate, or a corporation that
incorporated itself for the purpose of pub-

[Page 86]

lishing a newspaper could
not be tried and fined, or an action for damages be brought against it for
libel; or that a corporation which commits a nuisance could not be convicted of
the nuisance or the like. I must really say that I do not feel the slightest
doubt upon that part of the case.

From these authorities it is
manifest that a corporation can render itself amenable to the criminal law for
acts resulting in damage to numbers of people, or which are invasions of the
rights or privileges of the public at large, or detrimental to the general well
being or interests of the state. It appears to me perfectly clear that the
offence set out in the declaration comes within this description. A public
franchise was granted to the defendants to maintain and operate a railway
between two certain points. They were possibly under no obligation to accept
the charter, but having once accepted and acted upon it, they were under an
obligation to exercise proper care and diligence in the performance of their
corporate powers. Holding themselves out, as we are bound to assume they did,
as public carriers, they were bound to carry their passengers safely. Even as
carriers not of passengers, but of freight, carrying on their business by means
of trains and locomotive engines, they were, in my view, equally bound to see
to the safety and protection of their employees. Whether the persons alleged in
the indictment to have been killed were employees or passengers does not
appear, but whether passengers or employees, the company defendants were under
an equal obligation to both, and the offence committed was an offence not so
much against individual right or against people in their private capacities,
but against the public at large, and therefore, in the public interest,
indictable.

The learned Chief Justice has
stated that the question to be determined is whether or not the company is
liable to punishment under any section of the Code. Or, 

[Page 87]

(I add) at common law. It has
never been contended that the Criminal Code  of Canada contains the whole of the
criminal common law of England in force in Canada. Parliament never intended to
repeal the common law, except in so far as the Code either expressly or by
implication repeals it. So that if the facts stated in the indictment
constitute an indictable offence at common law, and that offence is not dealt
with in the Code, then unquestionably an indictment will lie at common law ;
even if the offence has been dealt with in the Code, but merely by way of
statement of what is law, then both are in force. As stated by a text writer

we can always separate the
offence from the punishment. So that for example a statute which provides a new
punishment for an old offence, repeals by implication only so much of the prior
law as concerns the punishment, leaving it permissible to indict an offender
either under the old law, whether statutory or common, and inflict upon him,
upon conviction, the punishment ordained by the new, or under the new statute
at the election of the prosecuting power. The offence and punishment,
therefore, may be defined by different laws ; and so. as we have seen, if a
statute simply creates an offence, the common law punishment may by implication
be imposed. Bishop on Statutory Crimes, 2 ed. p. 166.

But the ground of offence set out
in the declaration has, it is clear, been dealt with by the Code, and the
indictment is evidently framed, the prosecuting officer having them before him,
under the provisions of section 213, which is as follows:

Every one who has in his
charge or under his control anything whatever, whether animate or inanimate, or
who erects, makes or maintains anything whatever which, in the absence of
precaution or care, may endanger human life, is under a legal duty to avoid
such danger, and is criminally responsible for the consequences of omitting,
without lawful excuse, to perform such duty.

This article I take to be a mere
statutory statement of the common law, neither abridging nor enlarging it in
any respect. It is true this section has no penal 

[Page 88]

provision attached to it; it does
not state what the consequences shall be if the offence therein specified has
been committed ; but it clearly covers the offence specified here. The
defendants have in their charge and under their control, and they maintain, a
railway the running and operation of which without precaution or care must
necessarily involve danger to human life. They were therefore under a legal
duty to take precautions against such danger. They disregarded this duty. The
anticipated event occurred and they are criminally responsible for it. It is not,
I think, necessary to search through other provisions of the Code to find a
penalty. The common law, in the case of a corporation, prescribed it—a fine.
And the indictment is properly framed and the verdict found, and the fine
imposed, both under it and the common law together.

It was, however, contended, that
""every one"" at the beginning of the section, does not include a
corporation. I think it does. Section 3 (t) states:

The expressions
""person,"" ""owner,"" and other expressions of the same kind
include Her Majesty and all public bodies, bodies corporate, societies,
companies, and inhabitants of counties, parishes, municipalities or other
districts, in relation to such acts and things as they are capable of doing and
owning respectively.

""Everyone""' is an
expression of the same kind as ""person,"" and therefore includes
bodies corporate unless the context requires otherwise. There is no doubt that
the expression ""every one"" is, whether in a legal or popular sense, a
wider term than the word ""person,"" and in the case of Pharmaceutical
Society v. London and Provincial Supply Association[6],
already referred to, the Lord Chancellor (Lord Selborne), says:

There can be no question
that the word ""person"" may, and I should be disposed myself to say primâ
facie does, in a public

[Page 89]

statute, include a person in
law ; that is, a corporation, as well as a natural person. * * * *

That if a statute provides
that no person shall do a particular act except on a particular condition, it
is primâ facie, natural and reasonable (unless there be something in the
context, or in the manifest object of the statute, or in the nature of the
subject matter, to exclude that construction) to understand the legislature as
intending such persons, as, by the use of proper means, may be able to fulfil
the condition ; and not those who, though called ""persons"" in law,
have no capacity to do so at any time, by any means, or under any
circumstances, whatsoever.

Applying this rule to the present
case, inasmuch as criminal offences committed by corporations are for the most
part offences confined to the class in question in the present case, namely,
cases arising from dereliction in the performance of public duty, at all
events, offences as possible and likely to be committed by artificial as by
natural persons, there can be no reason, that I can see, why a corporation
should not be included in the phrase ""every one."" The article is a
statement of general principle of criminal law, applicable to the whole world,
and binding as much upon corporations as upon individuals.

Several sections of the Code were
cited to us at the argument, as including within their purview the offence
described in the indictment. If I am correct in the view I have taken of
section 213 above cited, the offence described in the indictment comes within
arts. 191 and 192, where the offence of a common nuisance is described and its
punishment provided for, the first section being a mere statement of the common
law in regard to criminal nuisance. Whether it does not also come within
sections 251 and 252 may be open to argument, although I am strongly inclined
to the view that where the Code specifies an offence and provides for the
punishment by imprisonment only, it does not necessarily follow that a
corporation

[Page 90]

may not be indicted and fined for
the offence so described. It is not, however, necessary to determine that point
here.

It is further argued that as the
indictment disclosed a case of manslaughter, and as (as is stated) an
indictment will not lie against a corporation for manslaughter, the conviction
was not maintainable. It is possible that the facts alleged in the indictment
would be sufficient to sustain an indictment for manslaughter against an
individual, but the offence alleged in the indictment here is not the
manslaughter ; it is criminal negligence in the discharge of duty. The killing
is not alleged as the offence, but merely the consequence of the offence. In an
indictment for manslaughter it is at least necessary to charge manslaughter as
the crime—to allege that the defendants ""unlawfully did kill and slay,
&c."" or ""did commit manslaughter,"" allegations wholly absent
in the present case. It is not, therefore, necessary here to express any
opinion as to whether or not under the present state of the law and its
constantly broadening and widening jurisprudence on the subject of the civil
and criminal liability of bodies corporate, they are capable of committing the
offence.

KING J. (dissenting).—I am of
opinion that the question stated in the reserved case should be answered in the
negative, with the result that the appeal should be allowed and the conviction
quashed.

Appeal dismissed.

PRESENT
:—Sir Henry Strong C.J., and Taschereau,
Sedgewick, King and Girouard JJ.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH
FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).

The Criminal Code , sec. 575 —Persona designata—Officers de facto and de jure—Chief Constable—Common gaming house—Confiscation of
gaming instruments, moneys, &c.—Evidence—The Canada Evidence Act , 1893, ss. 2 , 3 , 20  and 21 .

Sec. 5 5 of they Criminal Code . authorizing the issue
of a warrant to Seize gaming implements on the
report of the chief constable or deputy chief constable "" of a city or
town does not mean that the report must come from an officer having the exact
title mentioned but only from one exercising such functions and duties as will bring him within the designation used in the statute Therefore,
the warrant could properly issue on the report of the deputy high constable of
the city of Montreal. Girouard J. dissenting.

The warrant would be good if issued on the report of a person
who filled de facto the office of deputy high
constable though he was not such de jure.

In an action to revendicate the moneys so
seized the rules of evidence in civil matters prevailing in the province would
apply, and the plaintiff could not invoke "" The Canada Evidence Act  1893, "" so as to be a competent
witness in his own behalf in the province of Quebec.

Per Strong C.J.—A judgment declaring the forfeiture of money
so seized cannot be collaterally impeached in an action of revendication

APPEAL from the
decision of
the Court
of
Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of
Montreal, which dismissed the plaintiff's action with costs.

[Page 123]

The high
constable of the district of Montreal, (which includes the city of Montreal as
well as a large territory adjacent thereto,) was appointed under a commission
from the Crown in the year 1866 and has ever since then continued to hold that
office. In 1885 he appointed a deputy, who thereupon took the oath of office,
the attesting magistrate adding in the record of the oath the words ""jusqu'au
ler mai 1886"" The deputy was never re-sworn but has continued to act as
such ever since then and on the 14th October 1893 in execution of a warrant
issued on a report made by him by a police magistrate under the 575th section
of the Criminal Code  and addressed to him by name as ""Deputy High
Constable of the City of Montreal,"" he seized certain moneys and
instruments in a common gaming, house within the limits of the city of
Montreal.

The section
referred to empowers the magistrate to issue a warrant on receiving a report
from ""the chief constable or deputy chief constable of any city or town or
other officer authorized to act in his absence.""

The plaintiff
claims the money seized as his property which had been only temporarily
deposited for safe-keeping in the vault in use in the rooms where the gambling
was carried on, and brought action against the high constable and the clerk of
the peace for the specific recovery of the moneys in their custody. The
judgment of the court pronounced by His Lord-ship the Chief Justice contains a
further statement of the case and the questions raised upon the appeal.

Guerin for the appellant. As the moneys are
claimed under the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada the law of
evidence in this case would be subjected to the provisions of ""The Canada
Evidence Act  1893."" The court below improperly refused the plaintiff's
testimony when tendered, and he is entitled to a new trial, and to be heard as
a witness in his own

[Page 124]

behalf.
  Canada Evidence Act , 1893 ss.
2  3 20 and 21.

The report and
seizure were illegally made, the executing officer having no authority under
sec. 575  of the Criminal Code  and no valid confiscation can be founded upon
proceedings irregular and null ab
initio, The strict interpretation called for
in provisions leading to a forfeiture will not permit any officer to act unless
specially designated. Only certain officers in cities and towns are mentioned
and "" high constables "" or their deputies are not included. The
additional definitions given
in the 4th and 5th
clauses of the section make this very clear. Moreover, the deputy who acted in
making the report and seizure was not deputy high constable at the time as he
had been appointed and sworn only for one year from the 1st May, 1885, and was
never re-appointed or re-sworn, and it does not appear that he was even a peace
officer.

The
confiscation of the moneys was illegal as the provision in sec. 575  therefore
is an interference with property and civil rights in the province. British
North America Act sec. 92.

So far as the
plaintiff was concerned the judgment of the magistrate confiscating the moneys
was not res judicator, for he was not a party or privy to the
proceedings, and had no power to become a party or cross-examine witnesses in
the prosecution of the keepers Of the gaming house upon the information which
led to the declaration of forfeiture.

The learned
counsel cited the following authorities: Art. 1241 C. C.; Casgrain v. Léblunc ([1]) -Pothier ([2]); Starkie on
Evidence ([3]);
Greenleaf on Evidence ([4]).

Hall Q.C. for the respondent.

[Page 125]

[""The
court stated that they only wished to hear argument as to the authority of the
officer who made the report and seizure.]

The high
constable is a common law officer holding his commission from the Crown and is
the ""chief"" or ""principal "" constable or peace officer of
the whole district, including the "" city "" of Montreal. He is an
officer whose character and duties correspond exactly with the description of
the officers mentioned in the 575th section of the code. The terms used in the
section are merely descriptive of the character of the officer, and the
particular title given in his commission is of no consequence. The code sets
out, in the first place, the common law officers who may act, and by the 4th
and 5th subsections certain municipal police officers are vested with similar
powers The high constable holds original authority from the Crown under his
commission, and also at common law, and may perform ministerial acts by deputy.
The deputy need not be sworn, but in this case the deputy having once been
appointed and taken the oath of office the memorandum that he was sworn merely
until a certain date is immaterial; he could and did lawfully hold over in his
office as such deputy and was at the time of the seizure both de facto and
de jure a constable and
peace officer within the meaning of the section. See Bacon's Ab. ([5]);
Chitty Crim. Law ([6]).

THE CHIEF JUSTICE.—This
is an appeal from a judgment of the
Court of Queens Bench, which affirmed a judgment of
the Superior Court rendered by Mr. Justice Delorimier.

The action as
originally instituted was one against Adolphe Bissonnette, high constable of the district of Montreal, and Louis
Wilfrid Sicotte, clerk of the peace

[Page 126]

of the same district,
to revendicate certain specific moneys remaining in
the hands of the defendants, which had been seized under a warrant granted by
C. Aimé Dugas, Esquire, one of the police
magistrates of the city of Montreal. The money in question was, by an order or
judgment of the police magistrate before named, dated the 18th October, 1893,
ordered to be forfeited to the Crown for the public uses of Canada. The Attorney General of Canada having intervened in the action for the purpose of
maintaining the adjudication of forfeiture the plaintiff contested his grounds
of intervention, alleging that the money in question had been illegally seized
and forfeited. The action was heard in first instance before Mr. Justice Delorimier in the Superior
Court, who gave judgment for the Crown, and this judgment has been maintained
upon an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench by the unanimous judgment of that
court. The reasons for the judgment of the Queen's Bench are fully stated in an
opinion prepared by Mr. Justice Wurtele.

The Criminal
Code , 1892, section 575, enacts as follows '.

If the chief
constable or deputy chief constable of any city or town, or other officer
authorized to act in his absence, reports in writing to any of the
commissioners of police or mayor of such city or town, or to the police
magistrate of any town, that there are good grounds for believing, and that he
does believe, that any house, room or place within the said city or town is
kept or used as a common gaming or betting house the said commissioners or
commissioner, or mayor, or the said police magistrate, may, by order in
writing, authorize the chief constable, deputy chief constable, or other
officer as aforesaid, to enter any such house, room or place,* * * and to seize
* * * all tables and instruments of gaming and all moneys and securities for
money * * * found in such house or premises.

The police
magistrate or other justice of the peace before whom any person is taken by
virtue of an order or warrant under this section, may direct any cards, dice,
balls, counters, tables or other instruments

[Page 127]

of gaming * * * seized under this Act in any
place used as a common gaming house * * * to be forthwith destroyed, and any
money or securities seized under this section shall be forfeited to the Crown
for the ""public
uses of Canada.

On the 14th. of
October, 1893, Louis Seraphin
Bissonnette, then acting as deputy high constable
of the district of Montreal (which district includes the city of Montreal),
wrote and delivered to C. Aimè
Dugas, Esquire, a police
magistrate for the city of Montreal, the following report or letter :

MONTREAL, 14th
October, 1893.

To Mr. C. A. DUGAS,

Police
Magistrate,

Montreal.

SIR,—I beg to
report to you that there are good reasons for believing, and I do believe, that
the room composing the second flat of the house bearing
the civic number twenty-two of St. Lawrence Main Street, in the City of
Montreal, is kept and used as a common gaming house as defined in part XIV
section one hundred and ninety-six of the Criminal Code  of 1892 and this since
the first day of May last or about.

Judge Dugas issued his warrant directed to the same deputy high constable,
commanding him to enter the premises referred to in his letter and amongst
other things, to seize all moneys and securities for moneys found in the rooms
referred to

Under the
authority of this warrant the deputy high constable on the same day made an
entry into the rooms in question, and seized therein, amongst other things, the
moneys sought to be recovered in the present action. By his return to the
warrant also dated the 14th October 1893 the deputy high constable certified
and returned that he had seized in the premises mentioned in the warrant the
moneys

[Page 128]

now in
question. On the 18th of October, 1893, Judge Dugas, by an order or
adjudication under his hand ordered ""that the said moneys so found and
described as aforesaid be forfeited to the Crown.""

The appellant
now insists that these proceedings were irregular and illegal, for the reason
that Louis Seraphin
Bissonnette, who acted as
deputy high constable was not an officer within the meaning, of the
section of the code before quoted

Speaking for
myself only I am of opinion that the judgment, by which the money was declared
forfeited to the Crown, cannot thus be collaterally impeached in this action
brought against the high constable and the clerk of the peace for the specific
recovery of the moneys seized.

But, assuming
that in point of law this is not so and that the action is maintainable if it
be shown that Louis Seraphin
Bissonnette was not a
deputy chief constable within the meaning of section 575 of the code, for the
reason that proceedings would have been in that case wholly without
jurisdiction and void, I am still of opinion that there is no error in the ""judgment of the
court below inasmuch as Louis Seraphin Bissonnette,
who acted as the deputy of his father, the high constable, was an officer
qualified to make the report of the 14th October, 1893, upon which the seizure
and subsequent proceedings were founded.

There can be no
doubt or question that Adolphe
Bissonnette, the father
of Louis Seraphin
Bissonnette, had been
duly appointed by the provincial government of the late province of Canada,
under the authority of a statute to be the high constable for the district of
Montreal which includes the city and that his appointment had been regularly
made by a commission from the Crown which was in full force at the time when
the information was laid the war-

[Page 129]

rant issued and
the seizure under it made. That the elder Bissonnette came within the
description of chief constable, contained in section 575 , is too plain for
doubt. It is not of course requisite that the exact title of an officer acting under the statute should be that
given in the Act itself it is sufficient that his functions and duties are such
as to brinog him within the designation used in the
statute. Then, it is conclusively proved by the evidence and established by the
provincial Act under which Adoiphe
Bissonnette was appointed
that he was the chief constable of the district of Montreal, and that although
he was styled high constable he was also the chief constable of the district.
Had the high constable himself acted there could be no doubt, in my opinion,
that his acts would have been those of an officer within the words of the law,
an officer de jure, and therefore everything he did would
have been strictly legal. Adolphe
Bissonnette was however
absent from Canada at the time the proceedings which led to the seizure and
forfeiture of this money were taken, and he had appointed his son Louis Seraphin Bissonnette to act as deputy high
constable. This is shewn by the evidence of both the Bissonnettes who have been
examined as witnesses.

That the high
constable, a ministerial officer, the chief peace officer of the district,
having himself original authority from the Crown, and in no sense exercising a
delegated authority, could legally appoint a deputy, is, I think, too plain to
require argument ([7]).

A great deal
has been made of the objection that Louis S. Bissonnette was not regularly
sworn. But, in 1885, when he was first appointed to act as deputy high
constable he was duly sworn as such before Mr. Desnoyers, a judge of sessions,
and one of the police

[Page 130]

magistrates of Montreal, and the book in which his oath is recorded, has been put in evidence. It is true
that there is a
memorandum added by the
clerk, who does not appear to have been authorized to make the entry, that this
oath was limited to 1st May, 1886. This limitation of the oath whatever it may
mean is however quite immaterial; we have the undoubted fact that the younger
Bissonnette had been appointed deputy high constable, and that he took the oath
as such. Then there is abundant evidence to show that he had continuously acted
as such deputy, from the date of taking the oath up to the time of the proceedings
against the gambling house. Mr. Desnoyer's evidence is decisive as to this
Therefore I hold Louis
Seraphin Bissonnette to
have been, not merely de
facto but strictly de jure, the deputy chief constable for the
district of Montreal, answering in all respects to the description of that
officer in section 575 of the code.

But even were
this not so and if the appellant's contention that Louis Seraphin Bissonnette is only to be regarded as
having been properly qualified to act as a regularly appointed and sworn
officer for one year from 1st May, 1885, should be strictly correct in point of
law I should still hold that he de facto filled
the office of deputy and that being such de facto officer the proceedings taken by him
now impeached are not to be vitiated by reason of his not having annually
renewed his oath of office. The rule of law is that the acts of a person
assuming to exercise the functions of an office to which he has no legal title
are, as regards third persons, that is to say, with reference to all persons
but the holder of the legal title to the office legal and binding. Especially
is this so in the case of officers holding over and continuing to perform
official duties after their term has expired. Further this rule has

[Page 131]

been held to
apply to a delegate of a delegate whose appointment would be manifestly without
legal authority. Further, it has been held to apply even to judicial officers
and a fortiori to those appointed for the performance of mere ministerial
duties such as a head constable. And particularly it has been held to apply to
officers who have failed to qualify themselves by taking an oath of office
prescribed by law ([8]).
Under this state of the law which, as being part of the general public law, must,
I think, apply to all officers mentioned in the Criminal Code  which applies to
the whole Dominion, and is also I conceive the law of the province of Quebec, I
must hold that Louis Seraphin
Bissonnette's acts were,
even if those of an officer de
facto only such as to furnish a sufficient
foundation for the proceedings which resulted in the judgment of forfeiture now
sought to be avoided.

There is,
however, another objection to the appellant's right to recover this money,
which would be fatal to his action even if he had succeeded in showing that the
judgment of forfeiture was an absolute nullity. In this action the onus is upon
him to prove that the money seized belonged to him. It was not taken out of his
possession, therefore no presumption of property arises in his favour from the
fact of possession The money was, at the time of seizure, in the actual
possession of the persons who carried on the gambling establishment in the
upper rooms of the house.

It has been
argued that from the evidence we ought to conclude that the betting business
carried on upon

[Page 132]

the ground
floor was in no way connected with the gambling rooms upstairs, and that the
appellant merely deposited his money in the safe for convenience. My  conclusion
would be the reverse of this. It is proved that the managers of the gaming
tables were in the habit during the day time of acting as principals in the
betting on hoarser races, which the appellant claims to have been his exclusive
business and that the money which formed the capital for both the racing and
the upstairs business was mixed together and dealt with as a common fund from
which both the traffic which the appellant managed, and that carried on in a
more secret manner in the rooms above, were supplied with cash. Upon the whole
I think the inference drawn by both the Court of Queen's Bench and Mr. Justice
Delorimier as to the ownership of the money was entirely correct, and in the
words of Mr. Justice Wurtele, that the business which the appellant pretended
to have carried on, and that carried on upon the premises used as a common
gaming house, were both carried on for the benefit of the same parties.""

The
constitutional question as to the validity of the legislation applicable to the
case is so destitute of any reasonable foundation that it calls for no
observations. The same may be also said of the objection that the appellant was
held to be incompetent as a witness in his own behalf for there can be no doubt
that the law of evidence to he applied was properly held to be that of the
province of Quebec. Both these points were indeed disposed of by the unanimous
opinion of the court upon the argument here.

The appeal
should be dismissed with costs

[Page 133]

GIROUARD
J. This being, a case of confiscation the law under which, it was
made must be construed strictly. Article 575  of the Criminal Code  of 1892 in
certain cases authorizes ""the chief constable or deputy chief constable of
any city or town, or other officer authorized to act in his absence "" to
seize all tables and instruments of gaming and all moneys and securities for
money. It seems evident to me that this article contemplates that the
warrant of seizure should be made by a city or town officer, and not by a
county or district officer, and this interpretation becomes clearer when we
read ""paragraph 4 of the said article * ""The expression chief constable includes chief
of
police, city marshal, or other head of the police force of any city, town or
place."" And paragraph 5 makes d deputy chief constable "" include the
deputies of the same officer.

The
seizure and confiscation was made in this case by the deputy of the High
Constable Adolphe
Bissonnette,
who is admitted to be "" High Constable of and for the district of IV
Montreal."" In my opinion he is not ""the
chief constable or deputy
chief constable of any city or town or other officer authorized
to act in his absence,"" within the meaning; of article 575 of the code.

If
I were without authority I might hesitate to come to that conclusion, but it
seems to me that the point is clearly laid down in one or two cases. In Free
gard v. Barnes
([9]), a warrant was
directed to the constable of D., a parish in the county of W., and was delivered to the county constable of W and executed by him. Held that the warrant
could not be executed by any other constable' than by the constable of the
parish, and consequently the execution by the county constable was illegal.
This decision was affirmed in the case of The (Queen
v
Sanders
([10]) The

[Page 134]

warrant was
issued directed to ""the constable of Grainsborough,"" but was
delivered to the superintendent of police for the district, and executed by one
of the police constables under him. The question was : Was the arrest legal l The Court of
Criminal Appeal decided that as the warrant "" was directed to the
constable at Grainsborough,"" that is the parish constable only, it could
not lawfully be executed by any other person.

True, High
Constable Bissonnette has jurisdiction in the city of Montreal but he is not
the officer named in art. 575  to execute the seizures therein referred to, and
therefore the seizure made by him was illegal. In 1895 the Parliament of Canada
amended art. 575  in that respect, but of course that does not apply to the
present case. I am therefore of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with
costs and the seizure declared illegal

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Betting on
election—Stallholder—R.S.C. c. 159 s. 9—Accessory—R.S.C. c. 145 s. 7—Action for
money staked—Parties in pari delicto.

R.S.C. c. 159 s. 9 provides inter alia
that “every one who becomes the custodian or depositary of any money * * *
staked wagered or pledged upon the result of any political or municipal
election * * * is guilty of a misdemeanour” and a sub-section says that
“nothing in this section shall apply to * * * bets between individuals.”

Held,
reversing the decision of the Court of Appeal, Taschereau J. dissenting, that
the subsection is not to be construed as meaning that the main section does not
apply to a depositary of money bet between individuals on the result of an
election; such depositary is guilty of a misdemeanour, and the bettors are
accessories to the offence and liable as principal offenders. R.S.C. c. 145. Reg.
v. Dillon (10 Ont. P.R. 352) overruled.

After the election, when the money has been
paid to the winner of the bet, the loser cannot recover from the stakeholder
the amount deposited by him the parties being in pari delicto and the
illegal act having been performed.

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1]
affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court in favour of the plaintiff.

The plaintiff and one Richards made a bet on the
result of an election for the House of Commons and deposited the sums so bet
with the defendant as stakeholder. By the result of the election plaintiff lost
his

[Page 696]

wager and the money was paid by defendant to
Richards after notice given by plaintiff claiming a return of the money and
plaintiff brought an action to recover his share of the amount deposited with
defendant on the ground that the betting was illegal and the contract to pay
the money to Richards consequently void. The question for decision was whether
or not the stakeholder was guilty of a misdemeanour under R.S.C. ch. 159 sec.
9, and if he was, whether or not the plaintiff was an accessory to the offence
under ch. 145; if a misdemeanour was committed to which plaintiff was accessory
he could not recover.

The trial judge, the Divisional Court and the
Court of Appeal all held that plaintiff could recover following Reg. v.
Dillon[2].

Meredith Q.C. for the appellant. Betting
is illegal and even without the statute R.S.C. ch. 159 this action would not
lie. Herman v. Jeuchner[3]
overruling Wilson v. Strugnell[4].

A contract may be enforced where the betting is
only collateral to the agreement but not where it is the basis of it. See DeMattos
v. Benjamin[5]; Harvey
v. Hart[6]. See
also Scott v. Brown[7].

Aylesworth Q.C. and McKillop for the
respondent. R.S.C. c. 159 only makes illegal the machinery for carrying on the
business of betting, and does not apply to transactions between individuals.
Reg. v. Dillon2. See Cox v. Andrews[8].

Even if defendant committed a misdemeanour
plaintiff cannot be held to be an accessory. Reg. v. Heath[9]; The Queen v. Tyrrell[10].

[Page 697]

THE CHIEF JUSTICE.—This is an appeal from a
judgment of the Court of Appeal affirming that of the Common Pleas Division,
which in turn upheld the decision of Mr. Justice Street, the trial judge. The
action was brought by the respondent against the appellant to recover $500, the
amount of a deposit which had been paid to the appellant as a stakeholder under
the following circumstances. Just before a general election for the House of
Commons, on the 23rd February, 1892, the respondent and one John R. Richards
made a wager on the result of the election for the electoral district of the
city of London, for which John Carling and Charles Hyman were candidates, each
party betting $500, Richards betting that Carling would be gazetted as the
member elected, and the respondent betting that Hyman would be so gazetted. The
bet was reduced to writing and each party deposited $500 in the hands of the
appellant as a stakeholder. Subsequently and after the election, on the 29th
February, 1892, the respondent gave the appellant a written notice claiming a
return of his deposit and directing him not to pay over the money to Richards,
and this notice was repeated by one from the respondent’s solicitor on the 4th
March, 1892. Notwithstanding this the appellant did pay over the money to
Richards (whose candidate, Carling, had been gazetted) taking from him a bond
of indemnity. The respondent then brought the present action in all the stages
of which he has been successful. But one of the learned judges who have dealt
with the case in the several courts through which it has passed has taken the
view contended for by the present appellant. In the Court of Appeal the
Chancellor of Ontario differed from the other three members of the court. The
same result was also arrived at in a similar action of Trebilcock v. Gustin,
in

[Page 698]

which the present respondent was plaintiff, and
which came before the Queen’s Bench Division.

There was no difference between the parties as
to the facts. The respondent’s right to recover depends entirely on a question
of law. There can be no doubt that a wager on the result of a Parliamentary
election is at common law a contract forbidden by public policy, and in that
sense illegal. This is shown by the case of Allen v. Hearn[11]. It may also be within the prohibition
contained in section 131 of the Election Act, although that section, as I had
occasion to point out in the North Perth Election Case[12], has a much wider scope and is not
confined to aleatory contracts like wagers. This question of the legality or
illegality of the wager, or whether the illegality depends on common law or
statute, is of no importance in the present case. The authorities show most
conclusively that whether a wager be legal or illegal either of the parties to
it may withdraw his deposit or stake from the hands of a stakeholder at any
time before the latter has paid it over. We have no statute such as the
Imperial statute 8 & 9 Vict. ch. 110, which was in question in the
cases of Hampden v. Walsh[13]; Batson
v. Newman[14]; Diggle
v. Higgs[15]; and Trimble
v. Hill[16]. It
was held in these cases that the common law had not been altered in this
respect by the statute, and that the law remained as it had been settled by the
cases of Lacaussade v. White[17]; Eltham
v. Kingsman[18]; and Hastelow
v. Jackson[19].

In Hampden v. Walsh13, Lord
Chief Justice Cockburn thus states the law:—

[Page 699]

A distinction has, however, been taken
between cases in which the deposit was made to abide the event of an illegal
wager and others in which the wager not being prohibited by statute, or of an
improper character, was legally binding. In the former cases, the contract
between the principals being null and void, the money remains in the hands of
the stakeholder devoid of any trust in respect of the other party, and in trust
only for the party depositing who can at any time claim it back before it has
been paid over. In the latter the contract, prior to 8 & 9 Vict. c. 109, s.
18, not being invalid it was open to contention that money deposited on the
wager with a stakeholder must remain with the latter to abide the event.

Greater difficulty, therefore, presented
itself where, prior to the 8 & 9 Vict. c. 109, s. 18, money was deposited
on a wager not illegal, and the Courts of King’s Bench and Exchequer were at
variance on this point. In Eltham v. Kingsman[20] the Court of King’s Bench, consisting of
Lord Ellenborough C.J., Bayley, Abbott and Holroyd JJ., held that even where a
wager was legal the authority of a stakeholder, who was also (as is the case of
the present defendant) to decide between the parties, might be revoked and the
deposit demanded back. “Here” says Lord Ellenborough, “before there has been a
decision the party has countermanded the authority of the stakeholder.” “A man”
says Abbott J. “who has made a foolish wager may rescind it before any decision
has taken place.” In the later case of Emery v. Richards[21], the Court of Exchequer, where money had
been deposited on a wager of less than £10, on a foot race, and therefore,
prior to the passing of the statute 8 & 9 Vict. not illegal under the then
existing statute, held that the plaintiff could not demand to have his stake
returned, but must abide the event. The case of Eltham v. Kingsman20
does not, however, appear to have been brought to the notice of the court, and
in our view the decision of this court was the sounder one. We cannot concur in
what is said in Chitty on contracts, 8th ed. p. 574, that “a stakeholder is the
agent of both parties, or rather their trustee.” It may be true that he is the
trustee of both parties in a certain sense, so that if the event comes off and
the authority to pay over the money by the depositor be not revoked, he may be
bound to pay it over. But primarily he is the agent of the depositor, and can
deal with the money deposited so long only as his authority subsists. Such was
evidently the view taken of the position of a stakeholder by this court in the
two cases of Eltham v. Kingsman20 and Hastelow v. Jackson[22], and in that view we concur.

This case was followed and the law as laid down
by Cockburn C.J. adopted in the before cited cases of

[Page 700]

Trimble v. Hill[23], Batson v.
Newman[24] and Diggle
v. Higgs[25], and
in the two last of these cases, as well as in Hastelow v. Jackson[26] and Hampden v. Walsh[27], the notice of withdrawal was not given to
the stakeholder until after determination of the event. There can therefore be
no doubt of the respondent’s right to recover if the law had depended
altogether upon these authorities.

Certain statutory provisions peculiar to the
legislation of the Dominion, not avoiding the wager, but making, as it is
contended, the depositing in the hands of the stakeholder for the purpose of
the wager by itself an illegal act, are relied on by the appellant as
disentitling the respondent to recover back his money.

By Revised Statutes (Canada) chap. 159, subsec.
(c), sec. 9, it is enacted that:

(1) Every one who * * *.becomes the
custodian or depositary of any money, property or valuable thing, staked,
wagered or pledged * * * upon the result of any political or municipal
election, or of any race, or of any contest or trial of skill or endurance of
man or beast is guilty of a misdemeanour and liable to a fine not exceeding
$1,000, and to imprisonment for any term not exceeding one year.

(2) Nothing in this section shall apply to
any person by reason of his becoming the custodian or depositary of any money,
property or valuable thing staked to be paid to the winner of any lawful race *
* * or to bets between individuals.

By Revised Statutes (Canada), chap. 145, sec. 7,
it was enacted:

That every one who aids, abets, counsels or
procures the commission of any misdemeanour, whether the same is a misdemeanour
at common law or by virtue of any act, is guilty of a misdemeanour, and liable
to be tried, indicted and punished as a principal offender.

Section 9 of chapter 159 has with a very slight
addition been carried into the Criminal Code  1892, of which it now forms the
204th section. Section 7 of chapter 145 has not been adopted textually in the
Code, but the act it declares a misdemeanour is now included and made a substantive
offence by section 61 

[Page 701]

of the Code. The Code did not, however, come
into force until the first of July, 1893, and we must therefore have regard
only to the provisions of the Revised Statutes.

The appellant’s contention is that the first mentioned
statute makes the mere receipt of the deposit or stake to abide the event of
the bet a misdemeanour on the part of the stakeholder who becomes the
depositary of it and that chapter 145 section 7 also made the party to the
wager who deposited the money for the purpose of it guilty of a misdemeanour as
a party aiding, abetting and procuring the commission of a misdemeanour. The
respondent insists that this being a “bet between individuals” section 9 of
chapter 159 has no application inasmuch as the effect of those words in the
concluding clause of that section is to save from the operation of the statute,
not only “bets between individuals” but also deposits made for the purpose of
such bets.

Two points which have not been seriously
disputed may be disposed of at once. First, if the proper construction of
section 9 is that which the appellant contends for and the depositary of such a
bet as the parties made in the present instance on the result of a political
election is guilty of a misdemeanour, there can be no doubt that the party to
the wager who deposits the stake is within the definition of one who aids and
abets or procures the commission of a misdemeanour within the 7th section of
chapter 145. It follows that in such case the respondent would, by reason of
his complicity in the unlawful act of taking the money on deposit, be in
pari delicto with the appellant, and if such was the respondent’s position
the law is clear that he cannot recover money so deposited. The authorities
show decisively that when money is paid for an illegal purpose which when
consummated would

[Page 702]

put the party paying and the party receiving it in
pari delicto there is locus pœnitentiœ open to the party paying so
long as the illegal purpose has not been carried out. But where both parties
are equally wrong, and the mere payment of the money (as to the stakeholder in
the present case) constitutes the illegal act, there can be no withdrawal, and
the money cannot be recovered back. This is so clearly the law that it is hardly
necessary to cite cases to maintain the proposition. I will, however, refer to
one or two of the latest authorities. In Scott v. Brown[28] Lord Justice Lindley says:

Ex turpi causâ non oritur actio. This old and well known legal maxim is founded on good sense, and
expresses a clear and well recognized legal principle which is not confined to
indictable offences. No court ought to enforce an illegal contract or allow
itself to be made the instrument of enforcing obligations alleged to arise out
of a contract or transaction which is illegal, if the illegality is duly
brought to the notice of the court, and if the person invoking the aid of the
court is himself implicated in the illegality. It matters not whether the
defendant has pleaded the illegality or whether he has not. If the evidence
adduced by the plaintiff proves the illegality the court ought not to assist
him. If authority is wanted for this proposition it will be found in the
well-known judgment of Lord Mansfield in Holman v. Johnson[29].

In Herman v. Jeuchner[30] the case was that a man procured another
to go bail for him on depositing in the hands of the surety the amount of the
bail by way of indemnity in case of default. This was of course illegal, being
in contravention of the Statute of Bailbonds, 23 Hy. 6 ch. 9. The principal
sued the bail to recover the money alleging the illegality and insisting that
the illegal purpose had not been carried out. The Court of Appeal held that the
payment of the money to the surety was itself an illegal act. In Kearley v.
Thomson[31] the
illegal purpose had only

[Page 703]

partly been consummated, yet it was held that
the money paid for the illegal purpose could not be recovered back. In Taylor
v. Bowers[32] the
Court of Appeal say:

If money is paid or goods delivered for an
illegal purpose, the person who had so paid the money or delivered the goods
may recover them back before the illegal purpose is carried out; but if he
waits till the illegal purpose is carried out, or if he seeks to enforce the
illegal transaction, in neither case can he maintain an action.

And it is worthy of remark that so far from the
courts evincing any disposition to relax the law on this head we find the Court
of Appeal in Kearley v. Thomson[33]
saying that:

The application of the principle laid down
in Taylor v. Bowers32 and even the principle itself may at
some time hereafter require consideration, if not in this court, yet in a
higher tribunal.

Next, we come to what is really the single
substantial question in the case, that on which the judgments of all the courts
below have proceeded, the proper construction of the 9th section of chapter 159
of the Revised Statutes. If we read the first part of this section 9 apart from
the proviso contained in sub-section 2, I cannot conceive any one having a reasonable
doubt of its application to the present appellant as the custodian or
depositary of money staked and wagered upon the result of a political election.
These are the very words of the statute. Surely the appellant received the
money now sought to be recovered as a custodian or depositary of it as money
which had been staked and wagered by the respondent with Richards on the result
of the London Parliamentary Election. The case comes, therefore, within the
exact and literal terms of the enactment. Its plain construction according to
the language used (reading it of course without the proviso) involves no
absurdity, no inconsistency,

[Page 704]

and does not bring it into collision with any
other provisions of the statute. Construing it thus according to the plain
meaning of the words it is, in my opinion, a most salutary enactment, and one
which would be effectual in stopping the evil practice of betting on elections.
To any one who would doubt this I would say the very case before us shows that
this would be the beneficial consequence of a strict construction of the
statute. The actual bet now in question never would have been made without
putting up the money, and the money never would have been put up if it could
have been foreseen that neither the winning gamester nor the party depositing
could have made the stakeholder pay it over[34].

It is argued, however, that the second
subsection of chapter 9 in saying that the penal clauses shall not apply to
“bets between individuals” makes the whole statute inapplicable to a deposit
made for the purpose of a bet or wager such as this on a parliamentary
election, because such wager was made between “individuals.” I am not able to
read the words of the proviso in this way. Primâ facie they mean that
the section shall not apply to a bet or wager, not that they shall not apply to
the case of a deposit made for the purpose of a bet or wager. It is said,
however, that we are to construe these words as equivalent in meaning to the
words “any money deposited for the purpose of a bet between individuals.” I
know of no principle upon which we are entitled so to alter the primâ facie
meaning of the words in which the intent of the legislature is expressed by
adding other words, at least under such conditions as we have here. The words
of exception as they stand are perfectly intelligible. They apply to bets only,
not to deposits. The legislature says, in effect, nothing which

[Page 705]

has been said in the preceding part of the
section, making a deposit of money illegal and punishable, shall apply to the
bets in respect of which such deposit has been made if such bets are between
individuals. There is nothing absurd or even inconsequential in this. It may
well be that it was considered by Parliament that making the deposit of money
an illegal act, without extending the prohibition to the bets themselves, would
be an effectual way of putting down the evil the act was aimed at; but whether
it would or would not have that effect is not the question; it is sufficient
that the words have in their primary signification a plain obvious meaning
which leads to no illegal or absurd result, and is controlled by no context
requiring us to apply to them an extended or secondary meaning. The well known
“golden rule” so often referred to in the judgments of Lord Wensleydale[35] and originally propounded by Mr. Justice
Burton in the case of Warburton v. Loveland[36] therefore requires us to give the language
used its plain ordinary meaning. The courts have sometimes construed the words
used in statutes not according to their strict grammatical and ordinary
signification, but as elliptical modes of expression used as symbols for some
secondary meaning. This was the case of Robertson v. Day[37] where the Privy Council adopted this mode
of construction. But this was expressly referred to the principle that the
context called for such an interpretation. Here, as I have said, I can find no
such context, for I cannot find that there is pervading the statute any general
intent to confine it to pool selling or pool-rooms, which is the reason
ascribed for enlarging the actual words “bets between

[Page 706]

individuals” so as to include deposits for the
purpose of such bets. If the legislature had indicated an intention to confine
this provision of the act to pool-rooms and pool selling it would, of course,
be the duty of the courts to obey their mandate, but it must be observed that
the statute in that case so far as applicable to bets on elections would have
been useless; it would not have struck at the mode in which such bets are
usually made, and would moreover be palpably open to evasion. I cannot agree
that we are to add words which would manifestly have the effect of producing
such a result. Moreover the statute was a remedial one; construing it literally
it was intended as a remedy designed for the public benefit to suppress the
evil practice of depositing money for the purposes of bets at elections. It
ought, therefore, to receive a beneficial construction which in this instance
accords with the strict grammatical construction. If there had been in the
enactment itself any indication that it was to be restricted to deposits made
at particular places, or with persons belonging to particular classes such as
pool sellers, or professional gamblers, it would have been different, but as I
have said there is no indication of any such intent in the statute. Betting on
elections between individuals may be considered a great evil, but if the
legislature did not think fit to inflict a penalty for that their omission to
do so is no reason why we should hold that they did not intend to suppress
another attendant evil, when they have in so many words said that they did so
intend.

I regret that I should be compelled to differ
from so many learned judges for whose opinions I have a most sincere respect,
but I can find no answer to the argument on which the Chancellor has based his
judgment.

[Page 707]

Since writing the above I have read the
judgments delivered in the Queen’s Bench Division in the case of Trebilcock
v. Gustin, not yet reported. The learned Chief Justice of the Queen’s Bench
rests his judgment in that case on the principle that the appellant, a
stakeholder, is estopped from disputing the right of his bailor, the person who
has deposited the money with him, to withdraw it. I entirely agree that this
would be so if there had been no illegality in the act of depositing itself.
But if I have successfully demonstrated, as I have to my own satisfaction, that
the mere making of the deposit was in itself made by the statute an unlawful
act, then, for a reason of public policy which makes the resulting rule
altogether paramount to any estoppel operating as between the parties, an
illegal act having been consummated, the depositor cannot recover back his
stake.

The appeal must be allowed with costs and the
action dismissed with costs to the appellant in all the courts below.

FOURNIER J.—I am of opinion that this appeal
should be allowed with costs, for the reasons given in the judgment of the
Chief Justice which I have read.

TASCHEREAU J.—I would dismiss this appeal. The
defendant, appellant, has, in my opinion, entirely failed to impeach or weaken
in any way the cogent reasoning of the learned judges who formed the majority
in the court appealed from. Chief Justice Armour’s opinion in the analogous
case of Trebilcock v. Gustin also clearly demonstrates, in my opinion,
the unsoundness of the defendant’s contentions.

SEDGEWICK J.—This is an action brought by the
respondent against the appellant to recover five

[Page 708]

hundred dollars deposited in the month of
February, 1892, with the appellant to abide the event of a wager. The wager was
in writing as follows:

Mr. F.T. Trebilcock [the respondent] bets
Mr. J.E. Richards ($500) five hundred dollars, that C.S. Hyman is the gazetted
Member of Parliament for the city of London at the coming election for the
Dominion House to take place on Friday, the 26th day of February, 1892.

                                                                                     (Signed,)
FRED. T. TREBILCOCK.

                                                                                     (Signed,)
JOHN E. RICHARDS.

After the election the respondent demanded from
the appellant the $1,000 deposited with him, and subsequently demanded from him
the sum of $500 deposited by him with the appellant.

After the gazetting of the member for the city
of London (Sir John Carling, the opponent of Mr. Hyman, having been
declared elected) the appellant paid over the whole money to Richards.

The action was tried before the Honourable Mr.
Justice Street, sitting without a jury, who directed judgment to be entered for
the respondent for the sum of $500 deposited by him with the appellant, with
interest and costs.

The appellant then appealed to the Common Pleas
Divisional Court of the High Court of Justice, and subsequently to the Court of
Appeal for Ontario, both appeals being dismissed, Mr. Chancellor Boyd, sitting
as a member of the Court of Appeal, dissenting.

The appeal is now from the judgment of that
court.

The only questions involved are, first, the
proper construction to be given to cap. 159 R.S.C. sec. 9, and cap. 145 R.S.C.
sec. 7, and secondly, the effect of these statutes upon the transaction.

Now, I propose to construe this statute cap. 159
sec. 9 according to its plain and obvious meaning. I do not care what the
intention of Parliament was in passing it if that intention has not been given
effect to by the

[Page 709]

language used. The words themselves must govern.
These words so far as they affect this case are as follows:

Every one who * * * (c) becomes the
custodian or depositary of any money, property or valuable thing staked,
wagered or pledged * * upon the result of any political or municipal election *
* is guilty of a misdemeanour and liable to a fine not exceeding $1,000, and to
imprisonment for any term not exceeding one year.

Now the appellant Walsh became the custodian of
$1,000 staked upon the result of the London election, a political election. Was
that a misdemeanour under the statute? The majority of the Court of Appeal have
said no, that the object Parliament had in view was to restrain the abuse to
which gambling and betting leads where betting houses or places for recording
or registering bets or wagers or selling pools are kept in which money may be
staked or deposited in advance or otherwise by all comers, or in which other
forms of gambling upon the result of a race or election or other event are
facilitated, but that it leaves untouched the stakeholder or depositary of
moneys casually bet upon a political election as not being within the mischief
of the act; and they rely upon subsection 2, viz.: “nothing in this section
shall apply to * * bets between individuals” as conclusively showing that such
was the object of the legislation.

Now, if the words of the section are to be any
guide as to the legislative intention they show that instead of proposing to
deal with two the legislature intended to deal with four practices supposed to
be detrimental to public welfare, describing each practice in a separate sub‑clause.
These are (a) the use of premises for registering bets and selling
pools; (b) the use of apparatus for these purposes; (c) the
holding of stakes in connection with election bets and bets upon illegal
matches of any kind; and lastly (d) the registration of such bets.

[Page 710]

I cannot here see the slightest indication on
the part of the legislature that the two last mentioned practices were limited by
the question of place; that they might lawfully be exercised on the street but
became indictable offences when indulged in within the threshold of the betting
house; that their criminal character was to be determined by the matter of a
road line.

Neither is there any indication that the holding
of moneys bet upon elections was, in the conscience of Parliament, less
injurious to public morals than the keeping of betting houses or the possession
of gambling apparatus. The same sanction is prescribed in each case; the same
penal consequences ensue. In the legislative eye they are equal mischiefs. Then
as to the exception in subsec. 2 above set out; it is clear that the main
section does not attempt to make betting of itself a misdemeanour, not even
betting upon political or municipal elections. Betting in any shape or form may
be, I believe it is, a mischief; its tendency from first to last is opposed to
the greatest good of society; but as a sensible legislature never attempts to
suppress even an admitted evil unless there is a fair chance that with the
nation’s help the attempt will succeed, it did not in the present instance make
betting pure and simple, a mere exchange of words between individuals, a
criminal offence. But the keeping of betting houses, the public selling of
pools, the possession and working of gambling apparatus, the registration in
books kept for the special purpose of wagering transactions, and the actual
receiving and possessing of money or other property as a stake upon political
or other illegal bets, were overt acts, admittedly mischievous but at the same
time susceptible of easy proof, and therefore they one and all were made
illegal. The excepting statement as to bets between individuals was a
declaration by the legislature (it

[Page 711]

may have been an unnecessary statement) that in
this particular act it was not attempting to deal with betting per se,
but only with these concomitants of betting specified in the main section.

So far I am discussing whether the appellant
Walsh, the stakeholder, was chargeable with the statutory offence. In any event
I do not see how the excepting clause assists him. He made no bet, but he did
an act which certainly within the letter, and I believe within the spirit and
intention, of the act was expressly declared to be a misdemeanour.

And I am strongly confirmed in this view by a
consideration of the analogous Imperial act, 16 & 17 Vict. ch. 199,
the provisions of which I doubt not were present to our own Parliament when
passing this act. In that act it is manifest that the practices dealt with were
acts done in particular places. From the fact that in our act place is
not made by express words material as regards the offences specified in c
and d, we are justified in assuming that the question of place was
immaterial.

Then as to the construction of sec. 7 of chap.
145:

Every one who aids, abets, counsels or
procures the commission of any misdemeanour whether the same is a misdemeanour
at common law or by virtue of any act is guilty of a misdemeanour and liable to
be tried, indicted and punished as a principal offender.

Now the making of a bet is one thing, the
recording or registration of a bet is another thing and the depositing in the
hands of a stake-holder of the amount bet is again another thing. I admit that
under the statute the bet itself was not proscribed; whether the committing to
writing of the terms of the bet was a recording or registration of the bet, and
consequently a misdemeanour, we are not called upon in this case to decide. I
am of opinion, at all events, that it was a misdemeanour on the part of Walsh
to act as stake-

[Page 712]

holder of the money. His offence, his only
offence, was the taking of the money. Was not the giving of the money to him by
the respondent Trebilcock, knowing as he did the purpose of the deposit, an
aiding or counselling or procuring of the stake-holder’s taking? In my view of
this there can be no doubt and therefore Trebilcock was a misdemeanant liable
to punishment as a principal offender.

The final inquiry then is: Trebilcock having
paid the stake in question, having committed an indictable offence and (we may
assume for the purpose of argument having, upon conviction, undergone a year’s
imprisonment and paid a fine of $1,000,) can he now recover from the stake-holder
the $500 wager? (It is quite immaterial that he may have lost his bet and that
Richards under the code d’honneur was entitled to the $1,000).

Now I agree that apart from the statutes
referred to the respondent was entitled to recover and the decision of the
courts below was right.

In Roscoe’s nisi prius, 16th edition,
page 590, the law is summed up as follows:

Where money has been paid in pursuance of
an illegal contract it is generally irrecoverable.

Certain exceptions are, however, given as follows:

But in some cases it is recoverable as
money had and received to the use of party paying it; e.g. 1. Where the
contract remains executory though the plaintiff and defendant be in pari
delicto as a deposit upon an illegal wager. Where the plaintiff authorized
his money to be applied to an illegal purpose he may recover it before it has
been paid over or applied to such purpose. 2. Money is recoverable from a
stake-holder in whose hands it has been placed upon an illegal consideration
though executed by the happening of the event upon which a wager is made,
provided the money has not been paid over by the stake-holder to the other
party, or was paid over after notice to the contrary.

[Page 713]

And this statement of the law is fully borne out
by the very recent case of Barclay v. Pearson[38] where the cases of Hasletow v. Jackson[39] and Hodson v. Terrill[40] are reviewed and followed, and the law as
above stated by Roscoe is approved.

It will be observed that in this extract from
Roscoe, as well as in Barclay v. Pearson38, the phrases
“illegal contract,” “illegal purpose,” “illegal consideration,” are used, and
that the right to recover from a stake-holder is treated as an exception to the
general rule that “money paid in pursuance of an illegal contract is generally
irrecoverable.” The word “illegal” has more than one meaning; a contract may be
voidable and in that sense illegal at the option of only one of the parties to
it; he may take advantage of its illegality although the other party may not; a
contract may be illegal because solely upon grounds of public policy the courts
will refuse to enforce it, no further penal consequences resulting; and a
contract may be illegal because Parliament has enacted that the entering into
it is a criminal offence, subjecting the parties to punishment in consequence
of their having made it. Is there any distinction between these different kinds
of illegality? The general principle is illustrated by Lord Mansfield in Holman
v. Johnson[41].

But courts will aid a party, as the cases cited
show, where having only contemplated an illegal act and paid money to an agent
(as in the case of an unenforceable bet) in furtherance of it he has, before
anything further is done, before any offence is actually committed, done all
things necessary to reinstate himself.

But where a plaintiff has actually crossed the
line and committed an offence against the criminal law is

[Page 714]

there then a place for repentance? I am inclined
to think there is not.

Pollock in laying down the general rule says:

Money paid or property delivered under an
unlawful agreement cannot be recovered back unless nothing has been done in the
execution of the unlawful purpose beyond the payment or delivery itself (and
the agreement is not positively criminal or immoral).

In Tappenden v. Randall[42] where the exception above referred to is
established, it is intimated that it probably would not be allowed if the
agreement were actually criminal or immoral; in that case Heath J. says:

Undoubtedly there may be cases where the
contract may be of a nature too grossly immoral for the court to enter into any
discussion of it, as where one man has paid money by way of hire to another to
murder a third person. But when nothing of that kind occurs I think there ought
to be a locus pœnitentiœ, and that a party should not be compelled
against his will to adhere to the contract.

I pass by numerous cases since; Pearce v.
Brooks[43]; Rex
v. Dr. Berenger[44]; Reg.
v. Aspinall[45]; and
refer particularly to Scott v. Brown[46]
decided by the court of Appeal in August last, where the court refused to
enforce a contract held to be an illegal transaction and subjecting the parties
to indictment for conspiracy.

In the present case, as already stated, the
plaintiff had not only proposed the committing of an indictable offence—if that
had been all the locus pœnitentiœ would have still been open—but had
carried his proposition into effect, had committed a criminal act—had by the
simple act of paying the stake-holder the money aided and abetted him in
becoming in the words of the statute “the custodian of money staked upon the
result of apolitical election,” the result being that both are in pari
delicto, both are amenable to the

[Page 715]

criminal law and neither can avail himself of
the civil courts for redress. In my judgment the appeal should be allowed with
costs and the action dismissed with costs in all the courts below.

KING J. I concur in the judgment delivered by
the Chief Justice.

SPECIAL QUESTIONS OF LAW referred by the
Governor in Council to the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and
consideration.

The following are the questions so submitted
on the report of His Majesty's Privy Council for Canada, dated 6th April, 1910.

""The Committee of the Privy Council, on
the recommendation of the Minister of Justice, advise that, pursuant to section
60 of the 'Supreme Court Act,' the following questions be referred to the
Supreme Court of Canada, for hearing and consideration, viz.:

""1. Is a preliminary inquiry before a
magistrate necessary before a charge can be preferred under section 873 (a) of
the Criminal Code ?

""2. Has the lawful deputy of the
Attorney-General, appointed by competent provincial authority in the Province
of Alberta, authority to prefer a charge under section 873 (a) of the Criminal
Code  of Canada, without the written consent of the judge of the court or of the
Attorney-General in person and without an order of the court?

""3. Has the lawful deputy of the
Attorney-General, appointed by competent provincial authority in the Province
of Saskatchewan, authority to prefer a charge under section 873 (a) of the
Criminal Code  of Canada, without the written consent of the judge of the court
or of the Attorney-General in person, and without an order of the court?

""4. Has the lawful deputy of the
Attorney-General, of a province of the Dominion of Canada, appointed by
competent provincial authority, authority to grant the leave of the
Attorney-General of his province, under section 17 of the 'Lord's Day
Act'?""

""F. K.
Bennetts,

""Asst. Clerk
of the Privy Council""

[Page 436]

The above mentioned sections of the Criminal
Code  and ""Lord's Day Act"" are set out in the head-note.

Newcombe K.C., Deputy Minister of Justice, appeared for the Government of Canada.

Forde K.C., Deputy Attorney-General, for the
Province of Saskatchewan.

(C. A. Grant for the Province
of Alberta.

The court answered the first question in the
negative, Idington J. dissenting. The other three questions were unanimously
answered in the negative. Their Lordships delivered the following reasons to
support their answers.

Girouard J.—I think that the observations made by this court in Re Legislation
respecting Abstention from Labour on Sunday[1],
applies more strongly in a case like this. I have serious objection to sit in a
case which looks very much as if it were an appeal from provincial courts in a
criminal matter where the statute says there is no appeal to this court.
However, as our advice has no legal effect, does not affect the rights of
parties, nor the provincial decisions, and is not even binding upon us, I have
no objection to express my concurrence in the answers prepared by this court.

Davies J.—The questions one, two and three referred to this court
respecting section 873 (a) of the Criminal Code  practically ask us to sit
as a court of appeal on the judgment delivered by the Supreme

[Page 437]

Court of the Province of
Saskatchewan, in the case of The King v. Duff[2]. As no such appeal is allowed in criminal
cases where the judgment of the provincial court is adverse to the Crown, I
felt strongly that the better course would be for this court to refer the
questions back to His Excellency in Council, pointing out the fact that the
questions substantially though indirectly involved such an appeal and ought not
to be answered by us.

In addition I may add that we have not had the
benefit of an argument on both sides of the questions. Counsel representing the
Crown alone submitted their contentions. In giving my answers to the questions
1 do so with reluctance and solely in obedience to the imperative provisions of
the statute, ""Supreme Court Act,"" section 60, and out of deference to
the order of His Excellency in Council. At the same time I do not think this
court or its members would feel bound in any concrete case which might arise
hereafter by any expression of opinion we may now give on these questions.

I am strongly inclined to the opinion that the
subsections (l) and (m) of section 31 of the general
""Interpretation Act"" of the Dominion, which were strongly relied upon
by Mr. Forde as clearly settling questions two, three and four in the
affirmative, do not apply to them at all. The expression ""Minister of the
Crown,"" in sub-section (e) refers, I think, to a Minister of the
Crown of the Dominion of Canada only, and not to the ministers of the several
provinces. It is difficult to imagine the Parliament of Canada
""directing"" a provincial minister to do a specific act

[Page 438]

or thing. They might ""empower"" as it
is put in the alternative in the sub-section. But it seems to me Parliament
never intended that a ""lawful deputy"" of  a provincial minister,
whose duties as such are limited and defined by the several provincial
legislatures as they respectively may from time to time determine, and may and
probably are in many cases very far from co-ordinate with those of the
provincial minister, should have and exercise all the powers conferred from
time to time by Dominion statute upon the minister himself. These
considerations would not apply to the cases of Dominion Ministers of the Crown
and their deputies the relative powers and duties of whom are defined by
Dominion statutes, and are subject, of course, to its directions and supposed
to be well known to Parliament when legislating. Following this reasoning
sub-section (m) when it refers to ""any other public officer or
functionary"" means, on my construction, any other public officer or
functionary of the Dominion, and does not relate to provincial officials. This
construction, if correct, would effectually dispose of questions two, three and
four, in the negative. Even if not correct, I would still be of the opinion
that the Deputy Attorney-General of the Provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta
are not entitled as such to prefer a formal charge in writing against any
person under section 873 (a) of the Criminal Code , as enacted by the
""Criminal Code Amendment Act"" of 1907, ch. 8. That section permits
the charge to be preferred by ""the Attorney-General or an agent of the
Attorney-General."" I agree with Chief Justice Wetmore that the Deputy
Attorney-General is not ex officio such an agent, and this quite apart
from the special limitation upon his powers placed by section 10  of ""The
Act respecting

[Page 439]

the Public Service of Saskatchewan,"" 6 Edw.
VII. (1906) ch. 5, and the similar statute of the Province of Alberta. At the
time when section 873(a) of the Code was passed, there were persons in each of
these Provinces of Albert and Saskatchewan appointed by the Departments of the
Attorneys-General respectively to act for the Crown law officers at the
respective courts to which they were appointed and who were styled ""agents
of the Attorney-General."" These were, in my opinion, clearly the persons
and the only persons referred to by the section in question as ""an agent
of the Attorney-General,"" and their special mention would, even if
sub-sections (l) and (m) of section 31 were held applicable to the construction
of section 873(a) of the Code, exclude Deputy Attorneys-General. These
sub-sections of section 31 are only to be invoked when (as the section says) a
contrary intention does not appear. Here by specifically naming a special
well-known class of persons as ""agents of the Attorney-General"" for
the performance of a special judicial function or duty, the general deputy head
of the department, not being within the class, is excluded. ""The contrary
intention"" does appear and excludes the application of the sub-sections.

The 10th section of the provincial Act, 1906, to
which I have above referred, limits and defines the powers of the deputy heads
of the several departments as follows:

In the absence of any head the deputy head
of the department shall perform the duties of such head unless an acting head
of the department is appointed or the performance of such duties is otherwise
provided for by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council; and the deputy head so
acting during such absence shall exercise all the powers vested in the head as
to the control of the other employees of the department.

[Page 440]

In the ex parte argument addressed to us
this section (no doubt inadvertently) was not called to our attention, but it
seems to me conclusive, even if the sub-sections of section 31 of the general
""Interpretation Act"" did apply, against the contention submitted that
the Deputy Attorney-General was ex officio an agent of the
Attorney-General within the meaning of the terms in section 873 (a) of the
Criminal Code .

After examining the criminal legislation of the
Dominion with respect to the North-West Territories, and the Provinces of
Alberta and Saskatchewan carved out of them, and also the section of the Code
(873 (a)) applicable to those provinces alone, I am of opinion that the true
construction of that section does not require that there should have been any
preliminary examination before a magistrate before a charge could be preferred
under that section. For the reasons I have given I would therefore answer
questions one, two and three in the negative.

Section 17 of the ""Lord's Day Act,"" to
which question No. 4 relates reads as follows:

No action or prosecution for a violation of
this Act shall he commenced without the leave of the Attorney-General for the
province in which the offence is alleged to have been committed, nor after the
expiration of sixty days from the time of the commission of the alleged
offence.

Here there is no mention of ""an agent of
the Attorney-General"" exercising the functions and powers conferred on the
latter officer. The leave of the Attorney-General himself must be obtained. In
my view of the construction of sub-sections (l) and (m) of section 31 of
the general ""Interpretation Act,"" there can be but one answer and
that in the negative. Even if the subsections are applicable, I would greatly
doubt whether the ""leave of the Attorney-General"" required by section

[Page 441]

17 could be given by the Deputy
Attorney-General. The high official named is called upon to exercise a judicial
or at the very least a quasi judicial function in granting or refusing leave to
commence an action or prosecution under the Act, and I think the case of Abraham
v. The Queen[3] a
strong authority for the position that it is a function which he must
personally discharge and which he cannot delegate, and which is of a character
and nature not covered by sub-sections (l) and (m) even if applicable.

I answer that fourth question in the negative.

Idington J.—The creation of this court has been generally supposed to have
been intended as an exercise of the powers given by the ""British North
America Act,"" section 101, which is as follows:

The Parliament of Canada may,
notwithstanding anything in this Act, from time to time, provide for the
constitution, maintenance and organization of a general court of appeal for
Canada, and for the establishment of any additional courts for the better
administration of the laws of Canada.

It was constituted as a court of law and equity.
It was given an appellate and other jurisdiction.

In consequence of doubts expressed in In re
Legislation respecting Abstention from Labour on Sunday[4] the ""Supreme Court Act"" was
amended by 6 Edw. VII. ch. 50, now section 60 of the Act.

I must be permitted to doubt if it can as such
be made a court or commission of general inquiry, as the amendment seems to
read.

The words used in section 101, i.e., ""the
better administration of the laws of Canada,"" may, however,

[Page 442]

cover a pretty wide field. If this inquiry
extends beyond that field it probably is ultra vires.

Assuming but doubting if, in some such way the
inquiry falls properly within the second part of the above section 101, it
becomes pertinent thereto at the threshold to try to understand what Parliament
was about when amending the Criminal Code , by section 873 (a).

It is to be observed that though procedure falls
within the power of Parliament subject to that

the administration of justice in the
province including the constitution, maintenance and organization of provincial
courts, both of civil and criminal jurisdiction and including procedure in
civil matters in these courts

is assigned by section 92, sub-section 14, to
the authority of the legislature.

Parliament saw fit to amend the Criminal Code  by
enacting as follows:

873(a). In the Provinces of Saskatchewan
and Alberta, it shall not be necessary to prefer any bill of indictment before
a grand jury, but it shall be sufficient that the trial of any person charged
with a criminal offence be commenced by a formal charge in writing setting
forth as in an indictment the offence with which he is charged.

2. Such charge may be preferred by the
Attorney-General or any agent of the Attorney-General, or by order of the
court.

The question raised thereupon is: Has either the
lawful Deputy Attorney-General of Saskatchewan or of Alberta within his
province the power of the Attorney-General thereof under this section?

The creation of a Deputy Attorney-General and
the definition of his powers are entirely within the power of the legislature
and may be so regulated as to vary as directed from day to day. Certainly
Parliament is not to be supposed to have intended to meddle therewith.

[Page 443]

Nor can I imagine it was intended to entrust the
duty to one whose power to execute it varied from day to day.

The question of what power Parliament has to
assign to and enforce the performance of a given duty by any one holding a
particular office created by and under another autonomous power suggests an
interesting inquiry not easy of definite solution.

For that, if no other reason, its nominee by
such a method of designation ought in reason to be holding an office that has
some relation to the subject-matter being dealt with; and the more intimate the
better.

Though the authority of the Attorney-General of
a province is also subject to legislative limitations, custom, tradition and
constitutional usage, having charged him with the administration of justice
within the province as his primary duty, also pointed him out as the proper one
to have assigned to him such a duty as this section assigns.

Parliament was constituting in a new country an
authority to discharge the duties which the ancient institution of the grand
jury had elsewhere so long performed.

I would assume that Parliament had regard to the
history of that body and to such conditions of law and custom as governed and
guided it and in confiding to any officer the delicate duty of placing a man on
trial without the slightest notice beforehand as contended for here it might be
supposed to have had some regard to the responsible character of his position
as well as to the kind of person it was entrusting with such duties.

It might well be observed that the
Attorney-General is a person generally known to the public and

[Page 444]

so much in the public eye as to be probably responsive
to such just criticism for neglect of duty as his deputy clearly might not be.
An admirable deputy attorney-general within the sphere of duties the
legislature had assigned him might be quite unfitted to discharge such
functions as this new condition of affairs required.

The evident purpose of the whole enactment was
to throw the responsibility directly upon one man.

He might if he saw fit name his agents for
discharging, indeed, for the special purpose of discharging, such onerous
duties. Yet he should remain the responsible head for such delegations of power
to enable the duty to be properly discharged.

The express power of delegation thus given seems
to exclude the idea of any other being substituted.

A deputy attorney-general is not necessarily the
agent of the Attorney-General in any sense. He fills, as said already, whether
nominated or removable by the Attorney-General, an office generally created by
local statute and discharges duties thereby assigned.

Much less can it be the case that he can be said
to fall within the special description given in the Act.

On the other hand the deputy might be merely the
nominee of the Attorney-General. In such case, inasmuch as the Act implies
clearly that the Attorney-General should select special agents for this
purpose, it on this assumption excludes any one else and thus also the strained
meaning sought to be placed on the ""Interpretation Act.""

That meaning is not only inconsistent with the
purview of the amended Code and the very words of the section in question, but
with the interpretation clause of the Code assigning the meaning to be given
the words ""Attorney-General"" in the Code.

[Page 445]

How could Parliament more pointedly shew the
inconsistency that the ""Interpretation Act"" recognizes as possible and
fully provides against than this?

Are we prima facie to assume Parliament
had the intention in every case wherein it assigns a power to a provincial
officer and implies a duty to execute it that it must of necessity mean thereby
as of course to include any and every kind of deputy he may have? The clause
relied on in the ""Interpretation Act"" is hardly to be stretched so
far.

But in principle, as it seemed to me from the
very first, this case is within the case of Abrahams v. The Queen[5]. It also is almost within the very
language of the statute there in question.

A Crown counsel is but the deputy of the
Attorney-General and the lawful deputy for the time and place named.

This was a case where an indictment had been
preferred for an offence within the meaning of the ""Vexatious Indictments
Act"" as it stood in section 28 of ""An Act respecting Procedure in
Criminal Cases,"" etc., 32 & 33 Vict. ch. 29.

It prohibited the grand jury unless certain
preliminary steps described had been taken from finding any bill of indictment

unless the indictment for such offence is
preferred by the Attorney-General or the Solicitor-General for the province or
of a judge of a court having jurisdiction to give such direction or try the
offence.

No special efficacy can be attached to the word
""bill"" as suggested in the factum herein to distinguish it from this
case especially in view of the new meanings given contemporaneously with the
enactment of

[Page 446]

section 873 (a) to the word
""indictment."" See section 2, sub-section 16, of the Code.

The substance of the thing was looked at by this
court following the English courts. And the power of any one, save and except
him specially and specifically designated by his office to perform the judicial
act of giving legal sanction to the proceeding of putting a man on his trial,
was properly repudiated.

The second sub-section of the section of the
""Interpretation Act"" now relied upon stood then just as it does now.
No one seems to have had the courage to try it on the court. In a sense the
Crown officers might have been urged there as deputies and even lawful
deputies.

In substance and in language it is seldom we can
get cases so nearly alike. Substitute the word ""charge"" now included
in the word ""indictment"" and the cases seem almost on all fours.

It was the judicial quality of the act required
to be done that was held to render substitution impossible. It is that which
renders it inconsistent here with the meaning in the ""Interpretation
Act.""

Moreover, in this case the question involved is
not the comparatively trifling one there as to half a dozen or so specified
crimes, but it is the operation of the whole Code.

The deputies attorney-general not only claim
that the right and duty of putting any man on his trial has devolved upon each
of them, but also that of doing so without any need of a preliminary proceeding
of any kind.

If such be the import of the amendment so much
more significant is the designation by Parliament of one man and his agent
specifically delegated to discharge his appointor's duty in that regard.

[Page 447]

But is that the case? At first blush it seemed
so. However, when I find the interpretation section of the Code amended to make
the Act as amended by this section 873 (a) workable, it is evident it is not
intended this new section should be as it were an entirely new code of
procedure in itself.

If we interpret section 871, sub-section 2, in
light of these amendments, we find some curious results possible.

It seems to imply that where a man has been
prosecuted and some one bound over -to prosecute him the charge may have to be
confined within the limits of the original prosecution.

Of course all this, it may be said, is to be
discarded and a new prosecution, as it were, instituted by the Attorney-General
within section 873  (a).

On the other hand Is section 872 entirely
inoperative? Are all the provisions relative to preliminary examination and
inquiry and need therefor in the Code as it stood up to this amendment 873(a)
revoked?

Or is the said section only intended to
substitute the Attorney-General or agent or judge for the grand jury?

It is necessary in order to properly appreciate
all this and answer the first question submitted to bear in mind the history of
legal development relative to criminal prosecutions.

Originally the grand jury had the right to
entertain any complaint and present any offender without any preliminary
inquiry. In practice I think this was in later times not always or
unrestrictedly adopted.

In the old Province of Canada the law was
changed

[Page 448]

in 1861 by the ""Vexatious Indictments
Act"" expressly taking away the power in seven named cases of misdemeanour
unless with the consent of certain designated officers or judges.

With some changes in 1869 the law stood as above
indicated till the Criminal Code  was enacted in 1892.

Section 641 thereof expressly prohibited
indictments being preferred unless there had been the preliminary examination
followed by a prosecutor being bound over or a committal; or the
Attorney-General or any one by his direction or a judge permitted.

This was again amended by 63 & 64 Vict. ch.
46, and again by the Revised Statutes of Canada and stood as it now stands in
the Criminal Code  sections 870  to 873  inclusive.

These sections are plain. They require, except
in specified cases left to the discretion of an Attorney-General or a judge of
a court of record or of criminal jurisdiction, preliminary proceedings.

The amendment section 873 (a) does not in the
slightest degree imply any intention to repeal them beyond the obvious
necessity arising from the substitution of the officers above named for the
discharge of the functions of the grand jury relative to placing a man on his
trial.

It deals only with the case of ""the trial
of any person charged with a criminal offence."" How charged? Is it
confined to those who have been judicially so charged, by virtue of the
provisions of the law for committing the accused for trial?

How can it mean aught else? The word
""charged"" is the apt one to designate a person accused and in charge.
Doubtless it has another meaning, but it

[Page 449]

may well be argued that it is in this restricted
sense that the Act applies it.

It is true the Attorney-General by this
interpretation may either have the power given him under the Code in two ways,
or deprived of that he had already been given by section 872 of the Code.

It is equally true and significant that in one
place he alone is given the power and in the other place he or his agent, and
in reading these sections and giving each its full force the object is fully
accomplished of substituting some one else for the grand jury without bringing
about a revolution in the later principles upon which the administration of
criminal justice proceeded.

I am sure such a thing never was intended. I am
sure it would end in evil. The principle acted upon of not permitting any one
to be put on trial without preliminary examination had been carried so far as
to discard a coroner's inquisition. See section 940.

It may be said that merely rendered going before
a grand jury necessary.

I am satisfied from the practice of such a
thing, though possible in law, never having been attempted, it was of set
purpose to bring about a definite preliminary examination, as the key-note of
criminal prosecution save where an Attorney-General or judge directed
otherwise.

The result was in the plainest possible case the
hearing had to be repeated before a magistrate to ensure committal for trial.

The policy of the law that there should be a
preliminary examination was thus clearly settled and so settled in order that
on grounds of humanity and justice that examination might, as so often happens,
enable

[Page 450]

one accused, without perhaps the slightest
foundation, by cross-examination of his accusers or by his own explanations to
dispel the false appearances  against him and save him the pain and indignity
of being improperly placed on his trial.

The differences between that and the system of
placing a man on his trial without being given such opportunity is most
radical. The tendency in the one method is towards a humane administration of
justice and in the other towards the vicious reverse thereof.

There are cases arise as, for example,
prosecutions of municipal or other corporations in respect of such nuisance as
the maintenance of unwholesome jails or court houses or for non-repair of roads
where such considerations might not operate; but where the Attorney-General
might properly, if inconvenience unlikely to arise, authorize on his official
responsibility the trial of what after all savours of the trial of a civil
proceeding.

It seems to me the question cannot be answered
as if beyond doubt, and when answered here and thus ex parte can bind no
one.

But I am quite sure of one thing relative to the
administration of justice, and that is that no one entrusted therewith or any
part thereof should ever jeopardize or prejudice by the adoption of a doubtful
course of procedure, when a safer one was at hand, either the administration of
justice or the standing, reputation or freedom of another for a single hour.

I therefore answer the first question,
""yes,"" and each of the others, ""no.""

These answers are relative to the acts to be
done under 873(a) for obviously the answer must be so qualified.

[Page 451]

Duff J.—To all the questions submitted I answer ""no."" For my
reasons I refer to the opinion of my brother Davies. I desire, however, to add
one or two observations upon the legal quality and effect of these answers and
the opinions upon which they rest. The practice of asking the extra judicial
advice of the judges upon questions of law is an ancient practice. Seemingly
the last recorded instance in England in which without statutory authority such
advice was sought by the Crown occurred in 1760, when a question arising out of
the proceedings against Lord Geo. Sackville was submitted through Lord
Mansfield and answered. In that case, as in many previous cases, the judges
expressly declared that if the question should afterwards be brought before
them judicially they should be ready ""without difficulty to change""
their opinion[6]. It has
long been settled that the House of Lords is entitled to require the answers of
the common law judges upon questions as to the existing state of law whether
arising out of litigation pending before the House or not. But in such cases
the opinions of the judges have not in themselves the authority of judicial
precedent. In Head v. Head[7],
at page 140, Lord Eldon said:

The answers given by the judges, therefore,
although entitled to the greatest respect as being their opinions communicated
to the highest tribunal in the kingdom, are not to be considered as judicial
decisions.

Lord Eldon is here speaking of opinions given in
answer to questions arising out of contentious litigation actually pending
before the House and given after full argument.   The view of a very able and
experienced

[Page 452]

judge touching the value of such opinions where
there is no cause and no argument may be gathered  from the following passage
in the opinion by Maule J. in McNaghten's Case[8], at page 204:

I feel great difficulty in answering the
questions put by your Lordships on this occasion: First, because they do not
appear to arise out of and are not put with reference to a particular case, or
for a particular purpose, which might explain or limit the generality of their
terms, so that full answers to them ought to be applicable to every possible
state of facts, not inconsistent with those assumed in the questions; this
difficulty is the greater, from the practical experience both of the bar and
the court being confined to questions arising out of the facts of particular
cases; Secondly, because I have heard no argument at your Lordships' bar or
elsewhere, on the subject of these questions; the want of which I feel the
more, the greater are the number and extent of questions which might be raised
in argument; Thirdly, from a fear of which I cannot divest myself, that as
these questions relate to matters of criminal law of great importance and
frequent occurrence, the answers to them by the judges may embarrass the
administration of justice, when they are cited in criminal trials.

In more recent times it has been held that the
jurisdiction of the High Court of Justice upon questions submitted to it under
section 29 of the ""Local Government Act"" is consultative only and not
judicial. Ex parte County Council of Kent and Council of the Borough of
Dover[9].

With regard to questions submitted under the
Dominion statute the course of the Judicial Committee has, I think, been very
instructive. The authority conferred by the statute has been sometimes used for
the submission of specific points in controversy between the Dominion and the
provinces upon the construction of the ""British North America Act""
which, as bearing upon the validity of specific statutes, it was thought
desirable to have determined; both sides to

[Page 453]

the controversy having accepted the issue and
the tribunals having the benefit of the fullest argument upon it. Even in such
cases the Board has usually refused to pass upon questions touching private
interests not represented [the question relating to the rights of riparian
proprietors for example[10]], or
to answer questions the replies to which might properly be influenced by the
circumstances in which the questions should arise for actual judicial decision.
Attorney-General for Ontario v. Hamilton Street Railway Co.[11], at page 529.

The questions submitted in this case relate to
the construction of statutes governing criminal procedure and the answers to
them could not well be affected by the circumstances of any particular case in
which they might arise; and they are therefore not open to the same objections
as may be taken to purely hypothetical questions. But the court is called upon
to answer them, having heard argument from one point of view only; and in these
circumstances it is clear that the opinions expressed in the answers given
cannot have tire weight attached either to a judicial deliverance or to an
extra-judicial opinion pronounced after hearing the possible diverse views of
the question presented in argument. Indeed, there is not a little danger that
such answers may, as Maule J. said in the passage already quoted, tend ""to
embarrass the administration of justice,"" (not only in this court, if, as
is most likely we should hereafter be called upon to answer the same questions
when raised litigiously), but in

[Page 454]

other courts also, which may naturally feel
greater delicacy than this court on a proper occasion would feel in treating
the questions passed upon as res novœ, notwithstanding such opinions.

Anglin J.—Parliament has advisedly denied to the Crown the right of appeal
to this court in criminal cases from judgments of provincial courts in favour
of defendants. Because a review of the judgment of the Supreme Court of
Saskatchewan in The King v. Duff[12],
is unavoidably involved in the disposition of the present case and also because
of the strong disapprobation expressed by the Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council of the practice of procuring judicial opinions upon abstract questions (Attorney-General
for Ontario v. Hamilton Street Railway Co.[13]; The Brewers' Case[14]) the court answers the questions
now submitted with reluctance and diffidence, solely in obedience to the
imperative provisions of the statute (""Supreme Court Act,"" section
60), and in deference to the order of the Governor-General in Council. It must
be understood that as this opinion is given without the advantage of argument
except on behalf of the provincial Attorney-General, it would not be proper
that it should be deemed binding in any case which may hereafter arise, whether
in this court, or in any provincial court.

In the absence of any provision in the Criminal
Code  that there should be a preliminary magisterial inquiry before a charge is
preferred under section

[Page 455]

873 (a), the right to commence proceedings in
the Provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta against persons accused of offences
by preferring charges as provided in that section would appear to be
unqualified.

Under sub-section 1, of section 873 , of the Criminal
Code , applicable to the other provinces, a bill of indictment may be preferred
in respect of a charge as to which there has been no preliminary inquiry. This
section is the legitimate successor of part of section 28  of 32 & 33 Vict.
ch. 29 — other parts of which are replaced in a modified form by sections 871 
and 872 . Under section 28 the preferring of an indictment by the
Attorney-General or Solicitor-General was in certain cases an alternative to
its being preferred by a person who had been bound over to prosecute (section
871 of the Code) or to its being preferred by a Crown prosecutor (section 872
of the Code), or by the grand jury sua sponte against a person who had
been committed for trial. Section 28  provided that ""no bill of
indictment"" for certain specified offences

shall be presented to or found by any grand
jury unless the prosecutor or other person presenting such indictment has been
bound by recognizance to prosecute or give evidence against the person accused
of such offence, or unless the person accused has been committed to or detained
in custody, or has been bound by recognizance to appear to answer to an
indictment to be preferred against him for such offence, or unless the
indictment for such offence is preferred by the Attorney-General or
Solicitor-General for the province.

Under this section it cannot, I think, be
questioned that a preliminary investigation before a magistrate was not a
pre-requisite to the preferring of an indictment by the Attorney-General or the
Solicitor-General. It must not be forgotten that these provisions were
restrictive of the former absolute and unqualified right

[Page 456]

of grand juries proprio motu to present
indictments against any person whomsoever.

While the territory now included in the
Provinces  of Alberta and Saskatchewan was, as part of the North-West
Territories, subject in all matters to the legislative jurisdiction of the
Dominion Parliament, the statute in force provided that ""no grand jury
shall be summoned or sit in the Territories."" R.S.C. (1886) ch. 50, sec.
65. The courts of criminal jurisdiction of the Territories were constituted
without grand juries. The provincial legislatures of these two provinces have seen fit to continue this constitution
of their courts.

Having to deal with courts so constituted,
Parliament found itself obliged to provide some substitute for the methods of
commencing criminal trials prescribed for other parts of Canada in which grand
juries form part of the criminal courts as constituted by the provincial
legislatures. In the North-West Territories trials were begun

by a formal charge in writing setting forth
as in an indictment the offence   *   *    *   charged (54 & 55 Vict. ch.
22, sec. 11).

When the Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan
were created Parliament thought proper to make a more formal and definite
provision, and for this purpose enacted in 1907 what is now clause 873 (a) of
the Criminal Code . This provision is a re-enactment of section 11  of chapter 22
of 54 & 55 Vict. and an application of sub-section 1 , of section 873 , of
the Criminal Code  to the criminal courts as constituted in these provinces.
Parliament does not assume to deal with the constitution of these courts; it
merely provides, as it is its duty to do, a procedure suited to the courts as it
finds them constituted. Parliament having for that purpose adapted to the
existing local conditions the

[Page 457]

provisions of sub-section
1, of section 873 , of the Code, I see no sufficient reason for holding that a
preliminary proceeding, not requisite when a charge is preferred by bill of
indictment under section 873(1), should be deemed necessary when a similar
charge is preferred under section 873 (a). In the former case, with or without
preliminary investigation by a magistrate the grand jury may present a bill of
indictment preferred by the Attorney-General or by any one by his direction or
by any one with his written consent. In the latter the proceedings are
commenced by a formal charge in writing setting forth as in an indictment the
offence charged, which is preferred not before a grand jury, but directly to
the court and petty jury by the Attorney-General or an agent of the
Attorney-General or by any person with the written consent of the
Attorney-General.

For these reasons I am of the opinion that the
answer to the first question propounded should he, ""no.""

The power and duty of the Attorney-General under
sub-section 2, of section 873 (a), is statutory and quasi-judicial. Action by
him is substituted for that of the grand jury under section 873 . It is well
established that such statutory powers and duties can be delegated only under,
and in strict conformity with statutory authority. In Abrahams v. The
Queen[15] this
court so determined in regard to the functions of the Attorney-General under
section 28 of 32 & 33 Vict. ch. 29, the prototype in part of section
873 (a), sub-sec. (2). The Queen v. Hamilton[16]; The Queen v. Townsend[17].

[Page 458]

Two sorts of delegation are expressly provided
for in sub-section 2, of section 873 (a), viz., to

an agent of the Attorney-General — and by
""the written consent of the Attorney-General.""

Agents of the Attorney-General were well known
in the North-West Territories before the constitution of the Provinces of
Alberta and Saskatchewan. They were then agents of the Attorney-General of
Canada. It was stated at bar by counsel for the provincial Attorneys-General
that there are to-day in these provinces similar agents of the provincial
Attorneys-General. These agents have no. general authority to act for the
Attorney-General. They carry out specific instructions given in particular
cases. They probably correspond to persons acting by the direction of the
Attorney-General in other provinces under section 873(1). The Deputy
Attorney-General is not in my opinion an agent of the Attorney-General within
the meaning of sub-section 2, of section 873  (a). The form of the questions
referred to us renders it unnecessary to consider delegation by ""written
consent."" The fact that these two methods of delegation are specified in
section 873 (a) is in itself a cogent argument that Parliament did not intend
that any other delegation should be permitted.

Looking for other statutory authority to support
the delegation of the powers in question to the deputies of the provincial
Attorneys-General, counsel invoke clauses (l) and (m) of section 31 of
the ""Interpretation Act."" Although at first inclined to think that
clause (m) might apply, I am now satisfied that it does not. In clause (l) the
words ""Minister of the Crown"" mean a member of the Dominion
Government — one of the ministers mentioned in R.S.C. ch. 4, sec.

[Page 459]

4 — and not provincial ministers of the Crown.
The scope and nature of the ""Interpretation Act"" and the purpose of
clause (l) of section 31, seem to me to require that its application should be
so restricted. Counsel seemed rather disposed to concede this idea of the
purview of clause (l) to be correct. If it be so, the word other in
clause (m) preceding the words ""public functionary or officer""
indicates that the application of this clause is likewise confined to Dominion
appointees to the exclusion of provincial functionaries or officers. We would,
I think, give to these clauses of the ""Interpretation Act"" a much
wider and more sweeping effect than it is at all safe to assume Parliament
contemplated were we to hold that by virtue of them such a
quasi-judicial power as is by section 873 (a) conferred on the Attorneys-General
of Alberta and Saskatchewan is vested in their deputies. This power is of such
a nature — so personal and so discretionary — that nothing but specific
legislation unmistakably applicable can justify its delegation. If the deputies
of the Attorneys-General of these two newer provinces are by virtue of the
general provisions of the ""Interpretation Act"" clothed with this
power, the deputies of the Attorneys-General in all the other provinces must
have the like power under section 873(1). No one has yet been bold enough to
prefer such a claim. The history of section 873(1) is wholly inconsistent with
its existence. Having regard to the intimate connection between section 873 (a)
and section 873 (1) already alluded to, and to the history of the latter in the
courts and in Parliament, I think I am justified in saying that the language in
which section 873 (a) is couched affords sufficient evidence of that
inconsistency in intent and object which suffices

[Page 460]

to render the provisions of clauses (l) and
(m) of section 31 of the ""Interpretation Act"" inapplicable to it.
(R.S.C. ch. 1, sec. 2.)

I therefore conclude that for lack of statutory
authority their deputies are not, as such, clothed with the powers conferred by
section 873 (a) on the Attorneys-General for the Provinces of Alberta and
Saskatchewan.

Many of the same considerations apply with even
greater force in the case of the powers conferred on provincial
Attorneys-General by section 17 of the ""Lord's Day Act.""

The answer to each of the three questions
referred, numbered respectively 2, 3, and 4, should, in my opinion, be
""no.""

If the powers in question should be held to be
vested in a .deputy attorney-general virtute officii, having regard to
the provisions of section 10, of chapter 4, of 6 Edw. VII. (Alberta), and of
section 10, of chapter 5, 6 Edw. VII. (Saskatchewan), the occasions on which
the deputies of the Attorneys-General in those provinces could exercise them
would probably be comparatively rare.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

New trial—Decree of appellate court—Reasons for judgment.

B., a passenger on a railway train, was thrice assaulted by a
fellow passenger during the passage. The conductor was informed of the first
assault immediately after it occurred and also of the second but took no steps
to protect B. In an action against the railway company B. recovered damages
assessed generally for the injuries complained of. The verdict was maintained
by the Court of Appeal but the Superior Court of Canada ordered a new trial
unless B. would consent to his damages being reduced (34 Can. S.C.R. 74). In
the reasons given for the last-mentioned judgment written by Mr. Justice
Sedgewick for the court, it was held that damage could be recovered for the
third assault only but the judgment as entered by the registrar stated that the
court ordered the reversal of the judgment appealed from and a new trial unless
the plaintiff accepted the reduced amount of damages. Such amount having been
refused a new trial was had on which B. again obtained a verdict the damages
being apportioned between the second and third assaults. On appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment of the Court of Appeal maintaining
this verdict:

Held, Taschereau C.J. and Davies J. dissenting, that as
the decree was in accordance with the judgment pronounced by the court when its
decision was given, and as it left the whole case open on the second trial the
jury were free to give damages for the second assault and their verdict should
not be disturbed.

Held, per Taschereau C.J. that the decree of the court
should have been framed with reference to the opinion giving the reasons for
the judgment and, if necessary, could be amended so as to be read as the court
intended.

APPEAL from a decision of a Court of Appeal for Ontario
maintaining a verdict at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.

[Page 160]

The facts material to this appeal are fully stated in the above
head-note.

Johnson K.C. and Denison for the appellant.

Riddell K.C. and D.O. Cameron for the respondent.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE.—I am not quite convinced that, under the state
of facts brought out at the trial, this respondent has any right of action
whatever against the appellants upon any of the allegations of his statement of
claim. That is why, though I did not enter a dissent, I had, upon the first
appeal[1] to ask
my brother Sedgewick to write down the reasons for our judgment, not feeling
satisfied that I could myself find any good ones in support of the conclusion
of the court that the appellants were liable for the third assault complained
of by the respondent, though not for the two others. However, that judgment is,
of course, binding upon me. It is the settled law of the case.

As to the $2,500 for the second assault, the only point now
before us, I would allow the appeal. The respondent was not entitled to a
second trial as to this assault. The order or rule for a new trial drawn up in
the office must be construed with reference to the opinion of the court upon
which it is based, and, consequently, has to be read with the words

as to the third assault complained of by the respondent in
his statement of claim,

after the words “parties.” This judicial opinion was the only
effective authority for the drawing up of that rule or order. See per Esher
M.R., in Hollby v. Hodgson. It does not, strictly speaking, form part of
the record, but it cannot, as the respondent would contend, be entirely
disregarded in the construction of the formal order. On the contrary, as laid
down by

[Page 161]

the annotator to the word “Mandate.” vol. 13, Ency. of Pl. &
Pr. 847:

The lower court, in giving effect to the mandate of the
appellate court, should construe such mandate with reference to the opinion
accompanying it.

Where a cause is remanded to the trial court for further
proceedings, they must be had in accordance with the opinion or the direction
of the appellate court.

Id. vol. 2, 378. See Davidson v. Dallas[2].

In Pitts v. La Fontaine[3], in the
Privy Council, their Lordships, upon the construction of a previous
order-in-council, referred to a passage in their judgment to demonstrate what
had been their intention in making that order.

The opinion, delivered by this court at the time of rendering
its decree,

said Mr. Justice Gray, for the court, In re Sanford Fork and
Tool Co.[4]

may be consulted to ascertain what was intended by its
mandate and * * * upon a new appeal it is for this court to construe its own
mandate and to act accordingly.

See also West v. Brashear[5]; Supervisors
v. Kennicott[6]; Graff
v. Boesch[7]; and Smith
v. Day[8].

In Thompson v. Maxwell Land Grant and Rway. Co.[9],
Mr. Justice Brewer, delivering the opinion of the court, said, in the same
sense:

We take judicial notice of our own opinions, and although
the judgment and the mandate express the decision of the court, yet we may
properly examine the opinion in order to determine what matters were
considered, upon what grounds the judgment was entered, and what has become
settled for further disposition of the case. We therefore turn to the
former opinion and the mandate to see what was presented and decided.

The reasons for the judgment do not constitute the judgment, but
the formal judgment is void if inconsistent with the opinion of the court and
in direct opposition to it. And upon that ground would the

[Page 162]

court have said to this respondent upon appellant’s motion for a
new trial,

you cannot recover upon the evidence for the first and
second assaults, but we will give you another chance to prove that part of your
case.

The order of this court now in question limits to $1,000 the
amount that the respondent, in our opinion, was entitled to, not because we
held that he was entitled to that amount for the three assaults complained of
in his statement of claim, but because he was not, in our opinion, entitled to
recover for the two first assaults; and as the jury had rendered a general
verdict in his favour for a lump sum of $3,500, for which judgment had been
entered against the appellants, and as we were of opinion that this sum upon
the evidence was grossly in excess of the damages resulting to him from the
third assault, the only one for which the appellants were liable, their appeal
was allowed and a new trial ordered unless he, the respondent, agreed to take
$1,000 for the damages he had suffered from that third assault. Had we been of
opinion that the appellants were liable for the three assaults, their appeal
would have been dismissed. And had we been of opinion that they were not liable
at all for any of the three assaults, it is clearly not a new trial that we
would have ordered; judgment would then have been entered in their favour and
the respondent’s action dismissed. And had the respondent accepted the $1,000,
the judgment entered for that amount would clearly not have been a judgment for
the damages resulting to him from the two first assaults[10].

If necessary, in view of the circumstances of this case, the
order should be amended nunc pro tunc, in furtherance of justice, so as
to read as the court intended it to be.

[Page 163]

Every court has an inherent jurisdiction to put its records in
correct form, on application, or ex mero motû, in default of
application. No court will allow an order to stand which does not speak the
truth. Re Swire[11],
approved of in House of Lords, in Hatton v. Harris[12].
And for ascertaining what it was that the court really ordered or determined,
can there be a safer and more reliable guide than the written opinion of the
court filed as its judgment? And the parties are not at liberty either by
consent express or implied, nor by waiver or acquiescence to bind a court to
accept as its judgment anything else but that which the court intended to be
its judgment.

North J. in Shipwright v. Clements[13],
allowed an amendment of a decree 20 years old so as to make it comfortable to
the written opinion of the judge who had pronounced it. In Hatton v. Harris12,
in the House of Lords, a decree forty years old was amended,

Lord Penzance, in Lawrie v. Lees[14]
said.

I cannot doubt that under the original powers of the Court,
quite independent of any order that is made under the Judicature Act, every
court has the power to vary its own orders which are drawn up mechanically in
the registry or the office of the court,—to vary them in such a way as to carry
out its own meaning, and where language has been used which is doubtful to make
it plain.

See Smith v. Goldie[15] and Rattray
v. Young15, in this court.

In Rajunder Narain Rae v. Bijai Govind Sing[16]
their Lordships of the Privy Council held that

By the common law this court possesses the same powers as
the courts of record and statute have, of rectifying mistakes which have crept
in by misprision or otherwise, in embodying its judgments.

In Insurance Company v. Boon[17]
in the United States Supreme Court, it was said by Strong J.:—

[Page 164]

Every court of record has power to amend its records so as
to make them conform to and exhibit the truth. Ordinarily, there must be
something to amend by, but that may be the judge’s minutes or notes, not
themselves records, or anything that satisfactorily shows what the truth was;

and the learned judge goes on to say that though the opinion of
the judge is no part of the record, yet it is a guide for amending the formal
judgment.

However, in this case, I would not think an amendment necessary.
The order should be construed as if it, in express terms, restricted the new
trial to the third assault. If the trial judge had so construed it and, reading
it by the light of the opinion delivered by this court, had charged the jury
accordingly, the respondent would not have asked us, I am sure, to hold that
the judge had erred in acting in conformity to the unanimous opinion of this
court and to send the case back for a new trial because he had not directed a
erdict for all the assaults.

SEDGEWICK—I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.

GIROUARD J.—The whole difficulty arises out of what appears to
have been an oversight in the judgment of this court delivered in this very
case. The court did not seem to have anticipated that the respondent might
refuse the $1,000 allowed him in full satisfaction of his claim and take the
chances of a new trial.

The respondent, while travelling as a passenger on a train of the
appellants, was thrice seriously assaulted by a drunken fellow passenger,
first, at the Toronto Union Station, before the departure of the train, and
twice after, and claimed damages, in consequence, from the railway company. The
case was tried by a judge and jury who rendered a general verdict for $3,500.

[Page 165]

This verdict being sustained by the trial judge and the Court of
Appeal, an appeal was taken to this court, which, on the 30th November, 1903,
pronounced the following judgment, as per written memorandum read in open
court, and then and there handed down to the Registrar, which was recorded in
the minute book of the court, as follows:

Appeal allowed, no costs in this court nor in the Court of
Appeal. New trial ordered unless respondent accepts a reduction of damages to
$1,000, interest and costs of court of first instance, the latter costs to be
costs in cause to abide the event if respondent takes a new trial.

About a couple of weeks afterward, namely, on the 17th day of
December, 1903, the reasons for the said judgment were handed down to the said
Registrar, who is empowered by statute to publish the reports of the “decisions”
of the Supreme Court (sec. 112 of the Supreme Court Act). In the course of
time, frequently several months after their delivery, in this instance on the
30th of March, 1904, they were published in the Supreme Court Reports[18].

It appears from the report of the case that, as the court had
come to the conclusion, on the evidence adduced at the trial, that the company
was liable only for injury caused by the third assault, a new trial was ordered

unless the plaintiff agrees to accept $1,000, together with
costs, in full of his claim against the company. There will be no costs in the
court below nor in this court.

It must be noted that the reasons for judgment, like the
judgment, do not provide for the case of refusal by the plaintiff of this
reduced amount of damages, by limiting the new trial to the third assault or by
dismissing the action for any injury caused by the second assault. A new trial
was ordered generally.

Later on, on the 5th of January, 1904, the respondent, having
declined the option, applied to the Regis-

[Page 166]

trar for a settlement of the minutes of the judgment, and, after
hearing him and due service of said application having been accepted by the
solicitor of the company who was also present, and no objections being made,
the said Registrar settled and entered the minutes of judgment as follows:

1. This court did order and adjudge that the said appeal
should be and the same was allowed, and that the said judgments of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario and of the Chief Justice of the King’s Bench should be and
the same were reversed and set aside, and a new trial had between the parties,
unless the respondent should accept a reduction of damages to $1,000, interest
and costs of court of first instance, which option the respondent did, on the
31st day of December, 1903, refuse.

2. And this court did further order and adjudge that the
costs in the High Court of Justice for Ontario, in the event of such refusal,
should be costs to the successful party in the cause.

3. And this court did not see fit to make any order as to
the costs in this court.

I cannot conceive that this formal judgment, transmitted to the
court below, is at variance with the written memorandum read in open court as
the judgment of the court. I cannot even say that it contradicts the very terms
of the reasons. But suppose it is inconsistent with their tenor and meaning,
which document is to govern and constitute the judgment of this court? Is it
the judgment pronounced in court, which alone should be transmitted and
certified to the court appealed from, or the reasons for judgment which were
not read in court nor transmitted to the court below? Can it be said that the
reasons for judgment contain the “judgment or order” of the court within the
meaning of the Supreme Court Act? As I understand that Act, R.S.C. ch. 135,
especially sec. 2 (d), and sections 19 and 67, the pronouncement in
court, oral or written, of the decision of the court in any case constitutes
the judgment of the court. The reasons of judgment are mere opinions which may
be considered as part of the judgment in so far as they

[Page 167]

disclose the grounds upon which it is rendered, but they cannot
vary the text or dispositif of the formal judgment.

The judges of the lower courts are not bound by any expressions
used by the appellate court beyond and contrary to the decree. Such is also the
well established jurisprudence not only in England but in the United States,
and I submit, with due respect, that no other rule can reasonably and safely be
adopted. I hardly believe that it is necessary to quote authorities upon this
point; I will merely refer to the following where all the cases are collected;
Encyl. of Pleading and Practice, vol. xi., pp. 825-826; Seton on Decrees, (6
ed.) 187; Daniels Chan. Prac vol. i., p. 636. The new trial had to take place
as ordered by this court. It was held, accordingly, and the jury found
negligence as to both second and third assaults—a finding not shewn at the
first trial, the verdict being a general one—and returned a verdict for $1,500
by reason of the third assault, and $2,500 for the second one, which has been
sustained by the trial judge Anglin J., and the Divisional Court, Chancellor
Boyd, Teetzel and Magee JJ. We are now asked to set it aside as to the second
assault, the appellant relying upon our reasons for judgment on the first
appeal. I cannot examine the evidence in the latter case, the same not being
before us, and applying the principles of law laid down in our said reasons of
judgment and reading the evidence as I do in the present case, I have come to
the conclusion not to disturb the verdict.

It is contended that the evidence is the same at the two trials.
I do not know that, and I have no means of knowing. I see no admission of the
parties to that effect. I notice also an order of the master permitting the use
of any deposition of any witness given at the

[Page 168]

first trial only in the event of the plaintiff being unable to
obtain the evidence of such witness. I find in the present printed case only
one deposition taken at the first trial, that of Dr. McCallum. True, the
evidence given at the former trial is on file among the archives of our court;
but, as I understand my duty, I am functus officio and incompetent to
take it into consideration I must decide this appeal like any other one, just
as the Privy Council would do if ever called to review our decision, upon the
record before us.

The appellants have only themselves to blame if they are deprived
of the benefit of the former judgment of this court. They raised no objection
to the judgment as pronounced, nor to the settlement of the minutes, although
they were duly notified and appeared before the Registrar. They did not move to
have them corrected or completed by this court or a judge thereof, either
before they were transmitted to the court below or after, in the manner and
form indicated in several cases collected in the digest of the reports of this
court[19] in The
Chambly Manufacturing Co. v. Willett[20] and Letourneau
v. Carbonneau[21], both
decided in this court in 1904, and also in Annual Practice[22].

On the first of February, 1904, the appellants moved in the court
of first instance for a stay of proceedings upon the ground that they had
applied for leave to appeal from the decision of this court to the Privy
Council, which leave was later on refused[23]. They
must be presumed to have known then the tenor of the judgment, and yet they did
nothing to have the former properly rectified. They seemed to have

[Page 169]

relied entirely upon the principle of law involved in the case.

And, when the second trial was held, no objection to the charge
of the judge as to the second assault was raised; probably, in face of our
judgment, none could be made; not even a suggestion was thrown out that this
branch of the case had been disposed of by the judgment of this court. The
appellants evidently understood that the whole case was re-opened and relied
upon a fresh verdict as to both assaults, it being conceded by the plaintiff
that the company was not liable for the first one. It is now too late to allow
them to take a different view of the situation.

The appeal should be dismissed with costs.

DAVIES J.—This is the second time that this case has been before
us on appeal. On the first appeal[24] this
court laid down the rule as to a carrier’s liability, as follows:

Whenever a carrier through its agents or servants knows or
has the opportunity to know of the threatened injury, or might reasonably have
anticipated the happening of an injury, and fails or neglects to take the
proper precautions or to use the proper means to prevent or mitigate such
injury, the carrier is liable.

Applying that rule to the facts as proved we held that the
carrier company was liable for damages for the third assault (so called), and
was not liable for what was called the second assault. We, therefore, ordered a
new trial, and, in such trial, the judge very properly directed the jury to
find separately the damages for each of the assaults, which was done. No
question was raised here as to damages for the last assault, the appellant
finding itself precluded on the question of liability as to that by our
previous decision, and not raising any question as to their amount.

[Page 170]

The question, and the only question raised, is as to the
defendant’s liability for what has been called the second assault, but which,
as the trial judge justly remarked, might more properly, as against the
defendants, be called the first assault.

I have very carefully read all the evidence given at this second
trial, but am quite unable to see any difference on the only point now before
us between that evidence and the facts we had before us on the first appeal. We
then held that the facts were not such as would justify a conclusion that the
conductor ought reasonably to have anticipated this assault and taken measures
to prevent it. So far as the facts are concerned the evidence as to what
occurred at the Union Station and the Parkdale Station were admittedly the same
at both trials. Mr. Riddell contends that on this trial the evidence of
the conductor was not given and that Mr. Blain’s evidence is fuller and
more complete as to the facts at the moment the second assault took place. I am
not able to see that these two contentions in any way should alter the result.
So far as the assault which was made on the plaintiff at the Union Station, and
before the train started, is concerned, it is common ground that the defendants
are not liable. The conductor had no knowledge whatever of this assault except
what he heard from Blain himself just as the train was leaving. In fact the
train had actually started, but was stopped by some one to enable Blain, who,
after the assault, had left the train, as, he says, to get a constable, to get
aboard again. Then, for the first time, both men standing on the platform, the
conductor hears from Blain that he had been assaulted by some one, but whether
Anthony’s name was mentioned or not Blain could not say. He told the conductor
he would not go on the train unless the man was put off, and says the conductor
replied there

[Page 171]

was no time then, but that he would get a constable at Parkdale,
a station a couple of miles away. Just after this promise was given, the
plaintiff Blain swears, that Mr. Thornton, the ticket agent at Brampton, from
whom he had purchased his return ticket, came along the platform where he and
the conductor were standing and called out, “its all right, Mr. Blain, get on,
and, I still hesitated, he added, he (meaning Anthony) is quiet now, and, I
thought he was quiet now till we got to Parkdale.”

The only information the conductor had was that there had been an
assault but that the man who committed it was all right and then quiet. Before
hearing this he had given the promise about the constable.

At Parkdale, Mr. Blain spoke to the conductor on the platform
about the constable and was told there was none there and to get on. But he
does not say a single word intimating that the man had not remained quiet or
that anything had occured since assurances had been given to Blain and the
conductor that Anthony was quiet to make the conductor fear or anticipate any
renewal of trouble.

In all the evidence before us I have not been able to find a
single word or fact indicating that from the moment on the Toronto platform,
when the assurances were given about it being all right to get on, that the man
was quiet, up to the moment when the second assault took place, the man Anthony
had not remained perfectly quiet or that the conductor could or ought to have
had any knowledge to the contrary. In the absence of any such evidence, how can
it be held that the conductor could or should have anticipated a renewal of the
troubles? He knew nothing of the previous relations between the parties. He was
in charge of an excursion train filled with passengers, and learns, at the
moment of starting, that there had been

[Page 172]

an assault committed, whereupon, he tells the complaining party
to get on the train and he would have a constable at the next station. This is
followed by assurances from friends of the parties that the man had become
quiet and that it was all right. No subsequent information was given to the
conductor of any change in the man’s attitude, nor did any facts occur from
which he could or ought to have inferred any such change till after the second
assault took place. No evidence whatever was given that any change did as a
fact take place till the actual commission of the second assault. The
conductor, therefore, had been lulled into a false security and could not
reasonably have anticipated this assault. Mr. Blain, himself, did not
anticipate it. The assault was sudden, so much so that the friends of Mr.
Blain, who were sitting around him at the time, could not interfere in time to
prevent it,

Under these facts I feel that unless we reverse our previous
decision we are obliged to set aside the finding of damages for the so-called
second assault and to reduce the verdict to the sum of $1,500, the damages awarded
for the third assault.

The appeal should be allowed accordingly.

IDINGTON J.—Plaintiff having entered as a passenger one of the
defendants’ passenger cars forming a train which was to leave Union Station,
Toronto, for Brampton 11 p.m. on 10th October, 1901, was in passing along
the aisle assaulted, knocked down between two seats and pounded there by one
Anthony, till fellow passengers took him off.

Anthony was wild, boisterous, in a very noisy condition and
quarrelsome. He was drunk. He had immediately previous to this assault upon
plaintiff seized another passenger on the same train, shoved him back on a seat
threatening that he would choke

[Page 173]

him to death. He was a big, strong, powerful man, weighing about
two hundred and fifty pounds.

The train was a large one. The plaintiff with his wife, got off
the car, and he went for a constable, whilst she stood on the platform.
Meantime Anthony was scuffling with others on the car striking at them. People
were standing up and quite a row and noise were going on in the car.

This was five minutes before the train was due to leave. No
conductor or brakesman was about. After traversing the tracks going upstairs
and inquiring in vain for a constable, plaintiff returned to the train which
was starting.

Plaintiff says:

And some one called out, here is Mr. Blain; he is coming;
and the car stopped, and the conductor then for the first time came to me, and
he says: What did you stop the train for?

Q. Is that the tone he said it in?

A. A good deal more surly than that. I said, I did not stop
the train. He said why don’t you get on. I said I have been assaulted by a man
in there—I think I mentioned the name Anthony, but I am not sure—he has
assaulted two or three other parties, and he threatens to do it again, and I am
not going on the train unless he is removed or arrested. He says, well, the man
has a ticket, and he has a right to go. Well, I said, he has no right to go on
and commit a breach of the peace, and I won’t go on. He said, you get on; and I
positively refused. I had abandoned the idea of going. Well, he said, there is
no constable here, and if you get on we will have a constable at Parkdale. I
hesitated; and just at that moment Mr. Thorburn, the ticket agent at Brampton,
who had sold me the ticket, called out, he is all right, Mr. Blain, you get on.

Q. You told him you had been assaulted by some person, and
that you had been told he had assaulted two or three others, had you?

A. Yes.

Q. What others?

A. I saw him striking at Beattie, and I saw him striking at
Jim Noble before he made the assault on me.

Q. And then you also said he threatened to do it again?

A. Yes. As I was coming down the stairs somebody said, you
get a constable, Mr. Blain; he is threatening to go after you again.

Q. You do not know of your own knowledge about a threat?

A. No.

Q. But did you tell the conductor that?

[Page 174]

A. Yes.

Q. Then did you get on when he said he would get a constable
at Parkdale?

A. Yes.

Q. Would you have got on without that promise?

A. I certainly would not. I had abandoned the idea. I had no
hat; my hat had been knocked off, and I was running through the station without
a hat.

Q. Did not you see any of the officers at all around the
Union Station when you were running around that way without your hat looking
for assistance?

A. I did not; I tried earnestly to get a constable.

Q. Then did you get on?

A. I got on.

Q. Did you see Anthony at all between Toronto Union Station
and Parkdale?

A. I did not.

Q. Then at Parkdale what did you do?

A. I got off at Parkdale, and did not see the conductor or
Anthony. The car that I got off was not quite up to the station. I walked up
the platform past a car, and in the next car, one next to the one I passed, was
Anthony standing with a crowd around him, and I could hear him; he was talking
in a loud voice.

Q. Was he in the car?

A. He was in the car; and, of course, I was surprised he was
there. I looked around for the conductor, and I went into the station house and
the conductor was there; he was getting his orders. Mr. Burnett from Brampton
was there. After he got his orders I said to him, have not you got a constable?
Are you not going to remove this man? He said, there is no constable here.
Well, I said, it is only a matter of a few minutes to get a constable, and that
man will cause trouble all the way to Brampton, and he has been threatening me
again. He said: There is no one making a row but yourself. Well, I said,
I had a right to make a row. I continued addressing him as I was walking on
towards the train. He would hardly listen or stop, and when he got to the train
he waved his lantern and says, you get on or you will be left. So I had not
time to get back to the car I got off; I got on the car ahead of the one I got
off.

Q. Where was your wife?

A. She was in the car behind the one I got on. I hesitated a
moment, but my wife was in the car, and I could not possibly communicate with
her, and I got on.

Q. Then there was no way by which you could have
communicated with her if you had stayed off at Parkdale?

A. No.

Q. Where was your hat at that time?

A. I had no hat.

[Page 175]

Q. Then you got on at Parkdale?

A. I got on at Parkdale.

* * *

Q. Then did you see the conductor before the next assault?

A. No. The conductor got on the car in front of the one I
got on.

Q. Then from Union Station up to Parkdale, did the conductor
pass through the train?

A. No.

Q. Parkdale, that is the first station after you leave the
Union Station?

A. Yes.

Q, Did he pass through your car, at all events, from the
time that you left the Union Station until such time as you were assaulted for
the second time?

A. No.

Within three miles from this point where plaintiff so imploringly
made an appeal for protection, he was again assaulted by this drunken man in
such a violent manner that for the damages arising therefrom the jury has
awarded $2,500 damages, and the defendants say nothing as to the amount of the
damages.

The conductor came along just after this second assault, and
plaintiff relates thus what passed and was said, p. 21:

Now this man has attacked me again. Well, he said, I did not
see it. Well, I said, surely I am not to be killed before you believe me. There
are plenty of people who saw him and know what is going on, and you ought to
have him removed. Well, he said, he has a ticket, and he has a right to go on;
and he did not give any satisfaction in any way.

Q. Would he interfere to prevent him striking another
assault or is that all he said?

A. That is all he said.

Before reaching next station two miles further on, that is less
than five miles from where the protection was asked and refused, a third
assault took place, and plaintiff finally quit the train.

From Union Station the man Anthony is described to have been “mad
drunk” all the time and the condition of things in the car is described thus,
p. 32:

The ladies could hear what was going on in the smoking
compartment—a fearful noise, and everybody was crowding around to see the man.
He was perfectly wild, and people came. He was mad drank all the time.

[Page 176]

Q. Were the people in the car quiet all the way going up
from Toronto, too?

A. They were in a great state of excitement; the car in
which the first assault took place the women folks all left that car and went
into another car.

Q. And what about the other cars: were they quiet?

A. They were in an uproar all the way along.

Q. Then at any time was that uproar put an end to? Was it
quieted down at any time from the time you were assaulted at the Union Station
until you got off?

A. Never.

Burnett, another passenger, who was also assaulted complained to
the conductor and told him also of the assault on the plaintiff, and is asked:

Q. Then what did he say to that?

A. Well, he did not see the row or anything to that effect
at all. He did not seem to be around to see this row.

Q. No, I do not want the words; I want the substance of it?

A. He said there was no one around here to arrest him; there
was no policeman around.

Again, others desired arrest

Q. What did he say when they wanted him arrested?

A. Well, he said he did not see any row at all.

Q. Well, then, when Mr. Blain spoke to the conductor about
having been assaulted upon the train what did the conductor say to him then?

A. The conductor said there did not seem to be any police
around or any one around here to arrest this Anthony.

Witness repeats variations of this view conductor took of the
incident.

The condition of Anthony, the excitement in the car and the
expectation that Anthony would be arrested at Parkdale, and the attitude of the
conductor as testified to by each and all are corroborated by Beattie, and as
to the excitement in the car and Anthony’s condition, by Gilkinson and Broddie,
Mr. Clendenning and Mrs. Clendenning, and Graham.

The last named also adds, p. 69:

The conductor said he had a ticket and he had as good a
right to ride as Mr. Blain. Mr. Blain said he would not get on. Then the
conductor said he would have a constable at Parkdale and have him arrest him
there. Then we got on and the train went.

[Page 177]

Q. What else did Mr. Blain tell the conductor in addition to
the assault?

A. He told him that he thought he had threatened to attack
him again.

And Mrs. Blain, corroborating the general story adds, p. 74:

Q. Was anything said as to what the conductor would do at
Parkdale?

A. He said he would have him arrested.

A number of the passengers testify that the conductor and
brakesman could have managed Anthony if they had tried to arrest him and each
of the gentlemen says that, if asked by the conductor, they would have assisted
to arrest the drunken man.

In regard to those passages from the evidence cited above, that
relating to what transpired after the second assault I refer to as throwing
light upon the attitude of the conductor. It seems to rebut all that was
adduced in argument, as to the conductor having relied upon something that had
gone before, lulling him into apathy. It indicates an entirely different frame
of mind on the part of the conductor. He clearly did not, at the time, take the
position that counsel now takes here, that by reason of what had transpired,
after his promise at the Union Station to have the man arrested, he had been
induced to change his mind by his observance of the man’s condition or any
other facts that would lead a reasonable man to believe the danger had passed
away.

He seems, on the contrary, to have taken the stand even after the
second assault, boldly upon the ground that he had no right or power or duty to
interfere, unless the matter had come directly under his own eye.

No such position is open to a conductor under such circumstances.
I take it he was in duty bound, upon finding the disturbance that existed in
his train, and hearing the complaint that was made, to have taken

[Page 178]

due care to prevent a recurrence of such incidents as had been
already explained to him.

I think this evidence furnishes, within the principles laid down
in The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Blain[25],
which govern cases like this, sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to have the
questions submitted to the jury which were submitted, and to support the
findings of fact the jury have by their answers found, in relation to the
circumstances in question.

There is no objection taken to the charge of the learned trial
judge who seems to have left the case fairly to the jury, nor is there anything
else in the trial of the case to indicate that it was not fairly tried. The
results arrived at are wholly within the province of the jury, and I submit
cannot be interfered with by this court.

The order granting a new trial left the whole case open as if
nothing had transpired before the trial now in question. The case must
therefore be considered, I think, solely in the light of the evidence given at
that trial. It sometimes may be instructive to look at the facts of a previous
decision to ascertain what the exact point, if not sufficiently illustrated in
the opinion judgment, really was, that the court intended to decide. The doing
so however, must always be liable to produce error, for when the facts are not
set forth in the opinion judgment, it may well happen that some particular fact
may have been overlooked, or may not have been presented in the same light that
it may bear upon later and better argument. I have therefore not considered,
beyond listening to the arguments of counsel upon the point, the facts that may
have been reported as the result of the first trial. Counsel claims that the
evidence did differ in this, and

[Page 179]

that is not denied though the materiality of the difference is
questioned.

I think, therefore, the judgment of the Divisional Court should
be upheld, and the appeal dismissed with costs.

Appeal dismissed with costs.

Present:—Sir Elzéar Taschereau C.J. and Girouard, Davies, Nesbitt and Idington JJ.

ON APPEAL FROM THE TERRITORIAL COURT OF THE
YUKON TERRITORY.

New trial.—Contradictory evidence—Wilful
trespass—Rule in assessing damages— Practice—Adding party—Reversal on appeal.

In an action for damages for entry upon a placer mining claim
and removing valuable gold bearing gravel and dirt, the trial judge found the
defendants guilty of gross carelessness in their work, held that they should be
accounted wilful trespassers, and referred the cause to the clerk of the court
to assess the damages.

The referee adopted the severer rule applicable in cases of
fraud in assessing the damages. The Territorial Court en banc reversed
the trial judge in his findings of fact upon the evidence.

Held, reversing the judgment appealed from, that the
trial judge's findings should be sustained with a slight variation, but that
the referee had erred in adopting the severer rule against the defendants in
assessing the damages, and that his report should be amended in view of such
error.

Semble, that the record and pleadings should be amended
by adding the plaintiff's partner as co-plaintiff.

Held, per Taschereau C.J. dissenting, that although not
convinced that there was error in the judgment of the trial judge which the
court en banc reversed, while at the same time it did not appear that
there was error in the judgment en banc, yet the latter judgment should
stand., as the court en banc should not be reversed unless the Supreme
Court, on the appeal, be clearly satisfied that it was wrong.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Territorial
Court of Yukon Territory reversing the judgment of Mr. Justice Craig, at the
trial, and dismissing the plaintiffs' action
with costs.

 [Page 153]

The plaintiffs sued to recover damages sustained
through trespasses committed by the
defendants on fractional creek placer
mining claim No. 20A, below discovery, on Hunker creek in the Yukon Territory, of which the plaintiffs were grantees from the Crown at the time the action was brought. The
trespasses complained of consisted
of the removal of the pay-dirt and gold-bearing gravel from a portion of
the claim, covering an area of 964 square
feet, and the washing up by the
defendants and converting to their own use of the gold therein. The action was tried in June, 1903, before
Mr. Justice Craig, who found that the defendants
committed the trespasses complained of, and that they did so wilfully and deliberately, or at all events, that such gross carelessness was shown
by them in the operations from which
these trespasses resulted that they
must be accounted wilful trespassers. At
the trial it was agreed between counsel, with the approval of the court,
that the issue being tried should not bear upon the quantum of damages, but
that that should be referred to a referee later. Pursuant to this arrangement the judgment directed a reference to
the clerk of the Territorial Court to take an account of the plaintiffs' damages in accordance with
the declarations as to the
rights and liabilities of the parties set out therein. The
referee made his report fixing the plaintiffs'
damages at $14,993, for which amount and costs judgment was entered. From this judgment and report
the defendants appealed, and the Territorial Court in banco, Craig J. dissenting, reversed the judgment at the trial and dismissed the action. The
plaintiffs now appeal.

Aylesworth K.C. and
Walsh K.C. for the appellants.

Auguste Noël for the respondent.

[Page 154]

The Chief Justice (dissenting).—I would dismiss
this appeal. Not that I am convinced that there was error in the judgment of
the trial judge, which the court in banco reversed, but because I am not
convinced that there is error in the judgment in banco appealed from.

The appellant, I am free to confess, has
succeeded in creating considerable doubt in my mind as to its correctness, but
I cannot reverse upon a doubt. That judgment must stand if the appellant has
not convinced us that it is wrong, and that, as far as I am concerned, he has
failed to do. It may be that, had I formed part of the court in banco, I would
have affirmed the judgment of the trial judge, because, though doubting, I
would not have been clearly satisfied that he was wrong, but it is the judgment
of the court in banco that the appellant asks us to reverse, and we cannot
reverse it, though doubting, if not clearly satisfied that it is wrong.

In Hale v. Kennedy ([1]), it was held in that sense, that:

The rule generally followed by the courts
is not to review the finding of the judge of
first instance where his decision depends upon a balance of testimony;
still, if the court in banco has reversed that finding, this court must
be satisfied upon appeal that the court in banco was wrong, before it
will interfere with that judgment.

We are concerned directly, (said Lord
O'Hagan, in Symmington v. Symmington ([2])
an analogous case,) not with the judgment of the Lord Ordinary, (the trial judge,) but with that which overruled it; and
the latter, we ought to affirm
unless we are satisfied of its error,—

followed in this court in Demers v. The
Montreal Slearn Laundry Company ([3]).

Girouard J.—I would allow this appeal
and restore the judgment of
the trial judge in to, but, as the majority of the court has come to the conclusion to








[Page 155]

send the case back to re-assess the damages, I
will not dissent.

DAVIES J. concurred with Idington J. 

NESBITT J. concurred with Idington J.

IDINGTON J.—This appeal should be
allowed and the judgment of Mr. Justice Craig restored upon amendment to be
allowed.

A careful consideration of the judgments of Mr.
Justice Dugas and of Mr. Justice Macaulay and the evidence they respectively
lay stress upon, and the rest of the evidence supporting defendants' view of
the case, leaves no doubt in my mind but that the learned trial judge is right
in finding that the defendants had trespassed.

Much of the confusion that exists, arises from
attaching too much importance to some answers of the witness Hovland, which if
taken as literally and mathematically correct, may furnish an apparently good
foundation for what the majority of the court below have built thereon. Such an
interpretation of the witness's evidence is not warranted by it as a whole. He
did not, though placing his finger at point ""E"" in Exhibit H, intend
to convey the meaning that there was at that point, as distinct from shaft No 3
on same plan, another shaft with timber in it, and lagging leading from it
towards or across the line dividing 21 from fraction 20a. If he had been
for a moment so understood by court and counsel, we would have had much more
relating to this point E than we have been favoured with. The witness, quite
honestly, put himself, by his speaking of the centre of the cut and distances
he gave from that point, at another place than he would be, consistently

[Page 156]

with holding him as referring to shaft No. 3 in
much of his evidence. It is to my mind just one of those obvious errors that
occur daily at the trial of cases where a witness, however much he tries, may
not be able to be absolutely correct in regard to either time or space, and
especially when dealing with maps or plans which many intelligent men often
cannot com-prehend.

The witnesses have been so numerous and the
holes they refer to have been in their stories multiplied so many times beyond
what appear on the plans before us, as to render the case somewhat troublesome.
The learned trial judge, and counsel, I have no doubt, understood what each
witness referred to, and when the witness happens to speak of ""this""
and ""that,'' ""here"" and ""there,"" without specifically
identifying on the plan the point referred to, he was not confusing anybody at
the trial. This furnishes to my mind (in addition to the usual reasons for so
doing) abundant reason for here accepting the judgment of the learned trial
judge rather than that in appeal. I think it is not at all a case where there
is any need for assuming wholesale perjury to have existed in any view one
might take of the case.

But there is needed in the trial judge of a case
like this that keen discrimination that weighs the evidence by tests that
separate, as the trial proceeds, the results of the accurate from the
inaccurate witness, the candid, truthful one from the one less so. I am, therefore,
slow to suggest that the learned trial judge may have erred in his finding
wilful carelessness.

It is, however, by assuming that in the main the
witnesses tried to give us the truth that we are here enabled so to reconcile
nearly all the evidence, with the result arrived at. In doing so we have to
assume defendant and his witnesses, with one or two excep-

[Page 157]

tions, honest, and if honest there cannot be
that wilful carelessness imputed to the defendants that the law requires before
assessing damages on the scale which has been adopted. I think the milder rule
suggested in Trotter v. Maclean ([4])
should be adopted and the defendant should be allowed in any event the full
cost of getting out the gold in addition to the mere cost of washing after the
earth was dug out. I think, too, the referee has been influenced by the severer
rule having been adopted, into treating this piece of ground as exceptionally
rich as compared with all the surrounding ground, apparently thinking the
defendant should be punished with a very high average.

I offer no opinion as to the proper result other
than to say I am of opinion the result arrived at is unreasonable and
excessive, and is not supported by the evidence.

It is not clear that in law the respondents who
raised by their statement of defence the issue of title are precluded by their
failure to press it at the trial from now taking the objection they have done
as to Bonner not being a party. At all events the defendants are entitled to
have the doubt removed and Bonner, in whose name (with that of his partner) as
one of the partners the license stood when some of the trespasses were
committed, bound by the recovery herein. I think, therefore, he should be added
as, a party plaintiff. He seems to have assigned his rights to his partner
Kirkpatrick. That assignment may not so have transferred his right of action as
to vest it in Kirkpatrick. But evidently he intended to sell all his interests
to the remaining partner, and that sale carried with it the right to use his
name.








[Page 158]

The case has been tried as if the defendants
were liable therein for any of the trespasses that the licensees or any of them
might have a right to complain of, and to give effect to this result let the
suggested amendment be made; to carry out this let the court below amend the
record and the referee then re-assess the damages on basis indicated.

See Harper v. Godsell ([5]) at p. 428; Dawson v. Great Northern and City Railway Co.
([6]); May v. Lane ([7]); Colonial Bank v. Whinney ([8]); Job v. Potton ([9]); Caldwell v. Stadacona Fire & Life Insurance Co. ([10]).

The appeal then should be allowed with costs.

Appeal allowed with costs.

2240318,Priovolidis v R [2016] NSWCCA 201,"Judgment


	
	GLEESON JA: The applicant, Spiros (Ross) Priovolidis, seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him in the District Court by Conlon DCJ on 9 June 2015.
	
	
	The applicant had earlier pleaded guilty in the Campbelltown Local Court to two driving offences. The first was the offence of failing to stop when the applicant knew or reasonably should have known the police were in pursuit and driving in a manner dangerous to others (police pursuit) contrary to s 51B(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (Crimes Act). The maximum penalty for this offence is five years’ imprisonment. The details of the offence charged under s 51B(1) were that the applicant:
	


…. on 21 August 2013 at Campbelltown and other places in the State of New South Wales did drive a vehicle, … knowing that police officers were in pursuit of the said vehicle and that he was required to stop the vehicle and did not stop the vehicle and then drove the said vehicle in a manner dangerous to others. [Emphasis added].


	
	The second was the offence of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm (aggravated dangerous driving) contrary to s 52A(4) of the Crimes Act. The maximum penalty for this offence is 11 years’ imprisonment. The details of the offence charged under s 52A(4) were that the applicant:
	


….on 21 August 2013 at St Andrews and other places in the State of New South Wales did drive a vehicle… when it was involved in an impact occasioning grievous bodily harm to Charles HOVAREAU and at the time of impact the said Ross PRIOVOLIDIS was driving the vehicle in a manner dangerous to another person or persons in circumstances of aggravation, namely the said Ross PRIOVOLIDIS was driving the vehicle to escape pursuit by a Police officer. [Emphasis added].


	
	The sentences imposed by his Honour were as follows:
	



	
	In respect of the police pursuit offence – 2 years and 6 months’ imprisonment to date from 21 August 2013 and to expire on 20 February 2016.
	
	
	In respect of the aggravated dangerous driving offence – a non-parole period of 3 years to date from 21 February 2014 and to expire on 20 February 2017 with an additional term of three years, to expire on 20 February 2020.
	



	
	In sentencing for the aggravated dangerous driving offence the judge took into account, at the request of the applicant, pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (Sentencing Act), the applicant’s guilt in respect of a further offence listed on a Form 1 document, namely dishonestly possess interfered with unique identifier (vehicle identification number) contrary to s 154I(1) of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	The applicant was also sentenced on two related offences which had been referred to the District Court pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), namely an offence of drive while disqualified, contrary to s 54(1)(a) of the Road Transport Act 2013 (NSW), and taking a conveyance without consent of the owner, contrary to s 154A(1)(a) of the Crimes Act. On the former, his Honour imposed a fixed term of 6 months’ imprisonment to date from 21 August 2013 and on the latter, a fixed term of 12 months’ imprisonment to date from 21 August 2013.
	
	
	The total effective sentence comprised a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months with a total term of 6 years and 6 months.
	
	
	The sole proposed ground of appeal is that his Honour erred by imposing double punishment upon the applicant.
	


Relevant legislation


	
	Section 51B of the Crimes Act provides:
	


51B Police pursuits

(1)    The driver of a vehicle:

(a)   who knows, ought reasonably to know or has reasonable grounds to suspect that police officers are in pursuit of the vehicle and that the driver is required to stop the vehicle, and

(b)    who does not stop the vehicle, and

(c)    who then drives the vehicle recklessly or at a speed or in a manner dangerous to others,

is guilty of an offence.

Maximum penalty:

(a)    in the case of a first offence-imprisonment for 3 years, or

(b)   in the case of an offence on a second or subsequent occasion-imprisonment for 5 years.

(2)    In this section, “vehicle” has the same meaning as it has in section 52A.


	
	Section 52A(4) of the Crimes Act provides:
	


(4)    Aggravated dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm

A person is guilty of the offence of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm if the person commits the offence of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm in circumstances of aggravation. A person convicted of an offence under this subsection is liable to imprisonment for 11 years.


	
	The expression “circumstances of aggravation” is relevantly defined in s 52A(7) as including:
	


(7)    Circumstances of aggravation 

In this section, “circumstances of aggravation” means any circumstances at the time of the impact occasioning death or grievous bodily harm in which:

(a)    …

(b)    …

(c)    the accused was driving the vehicle to escape pursuit by a police officer, or

(d)    …

Circumstances of the offences


	
	The sentencing judge proceeded on the basis of the Crown’s statement of facts which had been agreed by the parties. The following summary is taken from his Honour’s findings on sentence, which were not challenged on appeal.
	
	
	The applicant was disqualified from driving on 5 January 1996. Between October 1996 and November 2012 he was convicted of numerous offences of drive whilst disqualified and other speeding and reckless or dangerous driving offences. The cumulative effect of those sentences is that the applicant will remain disqualified for 2 years from 14 December 2080.
	
	
	On 21 August 2013 at about 10.42am, police in an unmarked highway patrol vehicle observed the applicant driving a green Ford XR8 sedan in Railway Street, Campbelltown. This vehicle had been stolen a year earlier. It also bore license plates that belonged to another Ford Falcon.
	
	
	The applicant failed to give way to a female pedestrian at a designated pedestrian crossing on Railway Street. The pedestrian took evasive action. Police activated their lights and warning systems and followed the applicant, who proceeded through a red traffic signal at an intersection in Dumaresq Street. The police initiated a pursuit. A pedestrian attempting to cross the road was forced to stop in the middle of the road. The applicant proceeded through another red traffic signal at the intersection of Dumaresq Street and the Moore-Oxley Bypass. At the intersection of the Moore-Oxley Bypass and Cordeaux Street, Campbelltown, the applicant proceeded through a third red traffic signal by making a right hand turn in circumstances where a truck and bus were obstructing the view from the left. Police terminated the pursuit due to the danger being posed to other road users.
	
	
	The pursuit recommenced a short time later on the Moore-Oxley Bypass where the applicant’s vehicle was travelling at an estimated speed of 160 kph in a signposted 60 kph speed zone. At 10.44am, the police finally terminated the pursuit due to the high volume of traffic and danger to other road users.
	
	
	The conduct described above was identified in the agreed Crown Facts as the conduct the subject of the police pursuit offence.
	
	
	At 10.45am, a second police vehicle (fully marked as a Highway Patrol vehicle) which was stationary at the intersection of Blaxland and Campbelltown Road, Campbelltown, observed the applicant’s vehicle travelling north through the intersection on Campbelltown Road at an estimated speed of between 80 kph per hour and 110 kph. The police activated all warning signs and attempted to stop the applicant’s vehicle. The applicant failed to stop and the police commenced pursuit. The applicant’s vehicle was travelling at an estimated speed of 100 kph in a 70 kph zone. The police terminated the pursuit due to the danger being posed to the public.
	
	
	A short time later, that police car observed the applicant’s vehicle travelling on the intersection of Eagle Vale Drive and Raby Road intersection, controlled by a roundabout. The applicant turned north onto Spitfire Drive, Raby and the police re-engaged pursuit. The applicant was observed travelling at an estimated speed of 120 kph in a 60 kph speed limit zone overtaking a single vehicle on the incorrect side of the road. A little later, the applicant’s vehicle was observed travelling south along Campbelltown Road, Minto before it crossed onto the incorrect side of the road at the commencement of the concrete median barrier that separated north and south bound lanes. The applicant ignored a ‘Keep Left’ sign at the commencement of the concrete median strip. At 10.49am, police terminated the pursuit and pulled over to the nearside breakdown lane.
	
	
	The applicant’s vehicle was observed to continue along Campbelltown Road, travelling south in the northbound lane (the incorrect side of the road), weaving in and out of oncoming traffic until colliding with an oncoming vehicle driven by a 72 year-old man. The impact occurred well within the victim’s lane. Both vehicles sustained extensive damage. Police who were situated approximately 400 metres away observed the victim’s vehicle become airborne, and estimated that the applicant’s vehicle was travelling at a speed of no less than 80 kph in a 70 kph speed limit zone.
	
	
	The conduct described above was identified in the agreed Crown Facts as the conduct the subject of the aggravated dangerous driving offence.
	
	
	When police spoke with the applicant at Macquarie Fields’ police station he said: “It would never have happened if you’d left me alone and not chased me”. The applicant subsequently declined to be interviewed.
	
	
	The victim of the motor accident was taken to Liverpool Hospital suffering from a number of injuries including to his right shoulder and left anterior chest wall; displaced fracture of the right clavicle; blood in the right chest cavity; fractured sternum; lamina fractures of the third to fifth cervical vertebrae (broken neck bones); shallow right sided subdural haematoma over the right tentorium (intracranial bleeds); multiple rib fractures; fracture of the first lumbar vertical body (back bone fracture).
	
	
	The victim remained at Liverpool Hospital until he was discharged on 17 October 2013. Whilst in hospital the victim developed an acute embolic stroke that resulted in right sided hemiparesis (weakness with speech and swallowing deficiencies) which soon resolved although he suffered ongoing cognitive deficiencies.
	


Proceedings on sentence


	
	The proceedings on sentence commenced on 2 April 2015, were stood over, part-heard, to 13 May 2015 and due to the unavailability of documents on that date from Justice Health, stood over further to 9 June 2015. The applicant gave evidence in his case particularly directed to his medical condition, including ongoing eye problems. The Crown bundle (Exhibit A) included the agreed Crown Facts which, as indicated above, distinguished between the applicant’s two periods of conduct the subject of the police pursuit offence and the subject of the aggravated dangerous driving offence.
	
	
	The Crown provided detailed written submissions on sentence. Attention was drawn to the principle of totality and the need for careful consideration whenever sentences are accumulated. The Crown submitted that the totality principle was not restricted to sentences imposed for offences committed as part of a connected and roughly contemporaneous series of offences. The Crown further submitted that the sentencing judge should look at each offence individually then take into account totality and accumulation. The Crown submission continued:
	


It is submitted that in order to reflect the objective seriousness of each of the offences and give appropriate punishment for each, your Honour should at least partially accumulate the sentences.

The judge’s reasons


	
	After summarising the agreed facts, his Honour made the following findings. Dealing with the offence of police pursuit, the judge found that the objective gravity of the offending fell towards the top end of the range. His Honour took into account that there was “the extreme potential for danger to other users of the roadway” and in this regard also referred to the applicant’s:
	


final desperate act of trying to evade the police by crossing onto the incorrect side of the concrete median barrier and weaving in and out of the oncoming traffic would have been a terrifying experience for other motorists.


	
	Next, after referring to R v Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252, the guideline judgment for dealing with the offence of aggravated dangerous driving, and subsequent authorities, the judge found that the applicant “clearly abandoned his responsibility to other users of the roadway” and that his “moral culpability is high”. It is convenient to set out the following passage from his Honour’s remarks on sentence in full:
	


Of course the aggravated form of the offence arises from the fact that the offender was attempting to escape police at the time of the dangerous driving resulting in impact and grievous bodily harm. Whilst the Court is called upon to deal with the offender for the police pursuit charge the Court can have regard to aspects of his manner of driving leading to the collision and resulting injury. His driving was both erratic and aggressive and involved speeds well in excess of the applicable speed limit. He ignored the police warnings to stop. He ignored the keep left sign at the commencement of the median barrier. He took his car onto the incorrect side of the road into the path of oncoming vehicles, accordingly numerous other drivers were put at risk.


	
	The judge then summarised the applicant’s subjective case, including that the applicant was aged 45 years at the time of sentence, and his criminal history, including numerous convictions for driving whilst disqualified and related driving offences, and considered it such that he would not be entitled to any leniency. Having regard to the applicant’s ongoing eye problem, the judge found that the applicant’s time in custody would be much more difficult than it is for other prisoners. His Honour accepted that the applicant was genuinely remorseful.
	
	
	The judge expressed his satisfaction, given the objective seriousness of the offences, that no penalty other than imprisonment was appropriate: Sentencing Act, s 5. The judge also expressed the view that at least a partial accumulation in respect of the two sentences should be imposed.
	
	
	The judge found special circumstances (under s 44 of the Sentencing Act) to support a variation of the statutory ratio of the non-parole period to the overall term on two bases: one that there should be, at least, a partial accumulation in respect of the two sentences to be imposed; the other being that the applicant’s time in custody would be much more difficult due to his ongoing eye problem.
	
	
	After allowing for a 25 per cent discount for the early plea of guilty in the Local Court, his Honour imposed the sentences indicated.
	


Ground 1: His Honour erred by imposing double punishment upon the applicant

Submissions

Applicant’s submissions


	
	In writing, the applicant referred to the common element principle identified in Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610; [1998] HCA 57 (Pearce) at [40] and submitted that the overlapping elements between the two offences under ss 51B and 52A(4) meant that the sentences imposed on the applicant involved double punishment as described in Pearce. It was submitted that both offences were committed whilst in control of a motor vehicle, the elements in common being (a) escaping police pursuit; and (b) driving in a manner dangerous to other persons. The unstated premise of this submission regarding double punishment was that a single act by the applicant was the basis of both offences.
	
	
	In oral argument, senior counsel for the applicant submitted that the issue in the present case is of quite short compass. Counsel submitted that separation of the applicant’s driving into discrete aspects is an artificial construction of the circumstances, especially given that the total time involved was under 10 minutes. It was emphasised that the sentencing judge dealt with the facts of the offending on a global basis and did not make the distinction now drawn by the Crown in its submissions in this Court between the separate and distinct conduct giving rise to the two offences.
	
	
	As to the applicant’s failure to raise the double punishment issue before the sentencing judge, senior counsel for the applicant (who did not appear at the sentencing hearing) submitted that where a matter “may have been overlooked by the defence and the sentencing judge”, this Court may intervene to correct a miscarriage of justice or serious injustice, and relied on Zreika v R (2012) 223 A Crim R 460; [2012] NSWCCA 44 (Zreika) at [82] (Johnson J, McClellan CJ at CL agreeing) and White v R [2016] NSWCCA 190 at [28] (Simpson J, Bathurst CJ agreeing).
	


Crown submissions


	
	The Crown’s submissions took a different approach. No submissions were directed to the question of whether there were common elements between the police pursuit offence and the aggravated dangerous driving offence. The Crown’s submissions focused on the question of whether the two offences were based on different conduct such that the common element principle in Pearce did not apply.
	
	
	In support of this submission the Crown identified four aspects of the applicant’s driving on 21 August 2013, which the Crown submitted should be divided into two different parts. The first part involved the pursuit by an unmarked police highway patrol vehicle which commenced at 10.42am in Railway Street, Campbelltown up to the point where the police finally terminated that pursuit on the Oxley-Moore Bypass at 10.44am. The Crown submitted that this aspect of the applicant’s driving satisfied the offence of police pursuit contrary to s 51B(1).
	
	
	The second part involved the pursuit by a marked police highway patrol vehicle which commenced at 10.45am on Campbelltown Road, travelled through the suburbs of Raby (and it seems St Andrews) before turning back in the direction of Campbelltown via Campbelltown Road at Minto when the police stopped the pursuit at 10.49am and shortly thereafter the applicant’s vehicle collided with an oncoming vehicle, injuring its driver. The Crown submitted that this aspect of the applicant’s driving related to the more serious offence of aggravated dangerous driving contrary to s 52A(4).
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the criminality for the earlier driving conduct is distinct and separate to the criminality of the later conduct, because that earlier criminality was separate, there being a temporal disconnect between the two sets of offending.
	


Decision

(a)   The common element principle


	
	The common element principle identified in Pearce was reiterated in Johnson v R (2004) 205 ALR 346; [2004] HCA 15 (Johnson v R) at [33] – [34] where the plurality (Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ) emphasised that it is an error of principle to punish an offender twice for the commission of elements that are common to the offences of which he or she has been convicted.
	
	
	The premise of the common element principle is that the offender is being sentenced for two or more charges which arise out the same circumstances, or, as stated in Pearce (at [3]), the “two charges arose out of a single episode”.
	
	
	In Pearce, the offender broke into the victim’s home and beat him. Sentences had been imposed for numerous offences including counts 9 and 10, maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent contrary to s 33 of the Crimes Act, and breaking and entering a dwelling house and inflicting grievous bodily harm in the dwelling contrary to s 110 of the Crimes Act. In each case the victim, and the grievous bodily harm inflicted on him, was the same. The offender was sentenced to imprisonment for 12 years with a minimum term of 8 years on each of counts 9 and 10, to be served concurrently, but cumulatively upon a sentence for another offence. The High Court held that the sentence imposed on each offence fully punished the appellant for his infliction of grievous bodily harm on the victim. Accordingly, the offender was prima facie punished twice for that common element notwithstanding that the sentences for two offences had been ordered to be served concurrently: at [40] – [43] (McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ; Gummow J agreeing at [69], contra Kirby J at [132]).
	
	
	The plurality (McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ) in Pearce stated the common element principle as follows (at [40]):
	


[40]   To the extent to which two offences of which an offender stands convicted contain common elements, it would be wrong to punish that offender twice for the commission of the elements that are common.


	
	Their Honours continued (at [42] – [43]):
	


[42]   It is clear in this case that a single act (the appellant's inflicting grievous bodily harm on his victim) was an element of each of the offences under ss 33 and 110. The identification of a single act as common to two offences may not always be as straightforward. It should, however, be emphasised that the enquiry is not to be attended by “excessive subtleties and refinements”. It should be approached as a matter of common sense, not as a matter of semantics.

[43]   The trial judge sentenced the appellant to identical terms of imprisonment on counts 9 and 10 and made those sentences wholly concurrent. We can only conclude that the sentence on each of those counts contained a portion which was to punish the appellant for his inflicting grievous bodily harm on his victim. Prima facie, then, he was doubly punished for the one act.


	
	The plurality then considered whether the prima facie conclusion that the appellant had been doubly punished was avoided by the sentencing judge making the sentences wholly concurrent before concluding it was not. The plurality held (at [45]) that a sentencing judge must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of accumulation or concurrence, as well as, of course, questions of totality. The plurality continued (at [49]):
	


[49]   Looked at overall, it may well be said that the effect of the sentences imposed on this appellant was not disproportionate to the criminality of his conduct. Nevertheless, we consider that the individual sentences imposed on counts 9 and 10 were flawed because they doubly punished the appellant for a single act, namely, the infliction of grievous bodily harm. Further, to make the sentences imposed on those two counts wholly concurrent may also be said to reveal error in that to do so failed to take account of the differences in the conduct which were the subject of punishment on each count. (emphasis added).


	
	The relevant principle to be derived from Pearce is that where an offender is convicted of offences arising from the same set of facts which have elements in common, the court should not sentence twice for the elements of the offences which are in common.
	
	
	In Pearce, it was the single act of inflicting grievous bodily harm for which the offender was doubly punished.
	
	
	In Johnson v R, the offender had pleaded guilty to one count of attempting to obtain possession of prohibited imports to which s 233B of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) (Customs Act) applied, namely a quantity of ecstasy, and a second count of attempting to obtain possession of prohibited imports to which s 233B of the Customs Act also applied, namely a quantity of cocaine. The two offences arose from one transaction. In the High Court, the plurality held (at [33]) that the two offences “had much in common: one inducement, one payment for performance, one occasion, one package and one receipt of it by the appellant.” The plurality observed (at [30]) that the West Australian Court of Criminal Appeal had erroneously found that the offender took possession of two separate parcels of two separate drugs and that this error seems to have influenced the Court of Criminal Appeal in treating the offences as entirely separate, and in holding that there was no common element. The plurality stated (at [34]) that “[f]acts either lend themselves to the application of a particular principle or not.”
	
	
	In view of the conclusion I have reached below in relation to the proposed ground of appeal, it is unnecessary to consider the proper approach to sentencing when the offences arising from the same set of facts have elements in common: see the discussion in Portolesi v R [2012] NSWCCA 157 at [45] – [46] (Beech-Jones J, Basten JA and Harrison J agreeing).
	


(b)   The common element principle had no application on the facts in the present case


	
	It may be accepted for the purposes of argument (no submission to the contrary having been advanced by the Crown) that the elements of dangerous driving and police pursuit are common to both the offence under s 51B(1) and the aggravated form of the dangerous driving offence under s 52A(4). However, the existence of overlapping elements between the two offences does not in and of itself engage the double punishment principle described in Pearce. A closer examination of the facts is required.
	
	
	In considering the two offences’ underlying facts, the critical issue is whether the applicant’s driving on 21 August 2015 is, properly viewed, a single act or episode (as the applicant contended) or two separate and discrete acts giving rise to two separate offences (as the Crown contended).
	
	
	The starting point is the details of the conduct relied upon for each offence charged, which were different notwithstanding that they involved the driving of the same vehicle on the same day. The police pursuit offence was alleged to have been committed in a different suburb, namely “at Campbelltown and other places”. The aggravated dangerous driving offence was alleged to have been committed “at St Andrews and other places”. Location was thus an obvious differentiator between the respective charges.
	
	
	Next, the agreed statement of facts makes it abundantly clear that the two offences were separated in time and place, albeit that the temporal gap between the two offences was only very short. The conduct relied upon for the police pursuit offence was different from the conduct comprising the aggravated dangerous driving offence, the former offence being completed when the unmarked highway patrol vehicle terminated the pursuit on the Oxley-Moore Bypass at 10.45am, with the latter offence commencing with a pursuit by a second (marked) highway patrol vehicle at about 10.46am and concluding at about 10.49am when the applicant’s vehicle collided with an oncoming car on Campbelltown Road, Minto.
	
	
	In this case, the conduct relied upon as constituting the offences was separate and distinct. Although close in time and occurring in adjoining or nearby suburbs, this is not a case like Pearce where the two charges arose out of a single episode (the appellant having broken into the victim’s home and beaten him) or Johnson v R (where the two charges arose out of possession of one package of drugs). Both the terms of the charges and the agreed statement of facts support the Crown’s identification, in the applicant’s driving, of separate and discrete sets of conduct the subject of the two offences.
	
	
	That the sentencing judge treated the two offences as arising from separate and distinct conduct may be seen from his remarks on sentence. In his summary of the agreed facts, the judge noted the differences between the two highway patrol vehicles involved in the two pursuits. He also noted the different localities and the different times at which the two offences were committed. In accepting the Crown’s submission that there should be at least some accumulation of the sentences imposed, the judge may be taken to have had proper regard to the totality principle (Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295, 304 (Dawson and Gaudron JJ); 307 – 309 (McHugh J); 335 – 339 (Kirby J)) including the objective seriousness of each offence. This does not mean that his Honour treated the two offences as a single episode or incident.
	
	
	Further, it is apparent from the judge’s remarks on sentence (set out at [28] above) when dealing with the aggravated dangerous driving offence, that his Honour was careful to distinguish between the applicant’s separate conduct the subject of the police pursuit offence, and the regard which could be had “to aspects of the [applicant’s] driving leading to the collision and resulting injury”. The aspects of the applicant’s driving involving police pursuit which his Honour identified may be taken to refer to the applicant’s conduct during the police pursuit by the second police highway patrol vehicle from 10.46 am to 10.49 am through the suburbs of Raby, St Andrews and Minto, leading to the collision at Campbelltown Road, Minto.
	
	
	It can be accepted that in an earlier part of the remarks on sentence when describing the “extreme potential for danger to other users of the roadway” the judge went on to refer, in the context of the charge of police pursuit, to the applicant’s “final desperate act of trying to evade the police by crossing onto the incorrect side of the concrete median barrier and weaving in and out of the oncoming traffic would have been terrifying experience for other motorists”. This can be taken to be a reference to a subsequent aspect of the applicant’s driving involving the aggravated dangerous driving offence. As the applicant submitted, the judge at this point was dealing with the facts globally. Nonetheless, the distinction between the conduct involved in the police pursuit offence, and the subsequent conduct involved in the aggravated dangerous driving offence is implicit, arising from the judge’s preceding remarks as well as those made later when dealing with the aggravated dangerous driving offence.
	
	
	His Honour’s remarks should not be read as an acceptance that the two offences were derived from a single episode or incident. There was no occasion for his Honour to consider the question of double punishment on the facts of the offending in this case.
	
	
	In my view, the error asserted in proposed ground 1 of the notice of appeal has not been made out.
	
	
	Having regard to the above conclusion, it is unnecessary to decide whether the applicant is precluded from raising the double punishment issue in this Court, not having raised the issue at the sentencing proceedings. On the view of the circumstances of the offending which I take, it is unsurprising that it was not raised before the sentencing judge; contrary to the applicant’s submissions in this Court, the sentencing judge was not dealing with two offences arising out of a single episode or incident but rather two separate and discrete sets of conduct.
	
	
	Nevertheless, if it were necessary to decide, I would accept the applicant’s submission that the principle of double punishment is so fundamental that the failure by the applicant and the Crown to raise it before the sentencing judge would necessarily lead to error for the reasons given in Pearce, and that Zreika would not preclude the applicant raising the matter on appeal.
	


Conclusion and orders


	
	In my view, whilst leave to appeal against sentence should be granted, the appeal should be dismissed.
	
	
	PRICE J: I agree with Gleeson JA.
	
	
	HIDDEN AJ: I agree with Gleeson JA.

		21 September 2016",2016-09-20 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2240323,R v Cameron; R v Forward; R v Wilkinson [2016] NSWSC 1342,"Judgment


	
	Donald John Cameron and Stanley Robert Forward are before the court for sentence having pleaded guilty to a charge that they did murder Jacob Munro on 22 July 2014 at Schofields. David Ian Wilkinson has pleaded guilty to a count on the same indictment that he did receive, harbour, maintain and assist Cameron and Forward in the murder, contrary to s 349(1) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). All three men have pleaded guilty to a further count, also on the same indictment, that on 27 July 2014 at Schofields they knowingly took part in the cultivation of 664 cannabis plants being not less than the large commercial quantity, contrary to s 23(2)(a) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW).
	
	
	The maximum penalty of life imprisonment for murder may be reduced to a specific term of years pursuant to s 21(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) but not if the Court is satisfied that “the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through” a sentence of life imprisonment (s 61(1)). For reasons which will appear later in these remarks I consider that I should fix a finite term. In doing so I will have regard to the standard non-parole period of 20 years which applies to the offence of murder under Pt 4 Div 1A, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	The maximum sentence faced by Wilkinson as an accessory after the fact of the murder is 25 years imprisonment. No standard non-parole period is fixed by statute. By force of s 33 subss (1) and (3)(b)(i) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, the maximum penalty faced by each of the offenders for the offence of cultivation under that Act is 20 years or 5000 penalty units ($550,000) or both. The standard non-parole period is 10 years imprisonment.
	
	
	The years of birth of each of the three offenders and of other relevant persons and their respective ages at the date of the commission of the offences in mid-2014, were as follows:
	



	
	Cameron was born in 1952 and was aged 62.
	
	
	Forward was born in 1993 and was aged 21.
	
	
	Wilkinson was born in 1946 and was aged 67.
	
	
	Shaun Steven Zanker (further identified below) was born in 1989 and was aged 25.
	
	
	Phillip John Holder was born in 1961 and was aged 52.
	
	
	The deceased, Jacob Munro, was born in 1990 and was aged 24.
	


Circumstances of the murder


	
	Holder and Cameron were the principals of an enterprise of growing cannabis under hydroponic conditions on a property at Angus Road Schofields during the second half of 2013 and in 2014. There was a small house at the front of this block of land and a large steel shed at the rear. The shed and the residence were served by separate driveways. A large colour bond sheet metal fence surrounded the shed and restricted access to it and visibility of it. The fence separated the shed from the house.
	
	
	In August 2013 Cameron put down a deposit for rental of the property. He entered into a two year lease from 1 September 2013. Between then and July 2014 cultivation of a substantial number of cannabis plants was undertaken in the shed. This commenced with Cameron and Zanker setting up and fitting out the shed. Zanker worked under Cameron’s direction. I find beyond reasonable doubt that Cameron had the requisite know-how from his past experience with cannabis cropping: see [58]. He imparted his knowledge to Zanker and to the other workers in the business.
	
	
	Forward was introduced to Cameron in late 2013 or early 2014 by a person through whom Forward was accustomed to purchase cannabis. Cameron agreed to engage him at $200 per day. From about late 2013 Forward worked 2 or 3 days per week, first on the setup of the infrastructure and then on maintaining and harvesting the crop. As plants came to be harvested he contributed to the work of “trimming”. That is, cutting off leaves and preparing the plants for drying before sale. According to Forward, Cameron made periodic deliveries of the drug by car to a purchaser in Port Macquarie. About 8 to 10 pounds of dried cannabis were delivered at a time. On at least one occasion Cameron took Forward with him to Port Macquarie to introduce him to the buyer and to put him in a position to make delivery trips in future.
	
	
	Wilkinson joined the operation from about March or April 2014. He was introduced by Holder. He did some construction work and some crop management and harvesting. Wilkinson had building skills and helped construct a second, upper level of cultivation rooms within the shed. He was provided with accommodation in the on-site residence and he was paid $500 per week. S also lived in the residence, which had three bedrooms.
	
	
	Holder introduced Jacob Munro as a worker from about May 2014. Munro was at first permitted to live in the residence at the front of the property with Wilkinson and Zanker.
	
	
	There was continual friction between Munro and Zanker during June 2014. Altercations between them were at times physical. In about late June 2014 there was an incident when Jacob Munro seized Zanker around the throat, pushed him through a makeshift thinly constructed wall of an upstairs room in the shed and held him over the edge. Cameron attempted to prevent the hostility between Zanker and Munro from flaring into violence by directing these two younger men to work in different parts of the operation. After the violent incident in late June 2014 Cameron asked Holder to cease employing Jacob Munro and to order him off the property.
	
	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that by this time Cameron believed Munro was highly unstable and unreliable. According to Forward, Cameron informed zanker and Wilkinson during June and July 2014, in Forward’s presence, that he feared Munro would “bring heat to the crop”. Cameron said that if Munro was simply fired there was a risk he might tell his friends about the crop and that they might “rob the place”. Alternatively, the police would find out about the activity at Schofields through Munro’s loose talk. I accept beyond reasonable doubt that Cameron held these fears. I infer, beyond reasonable doubt, that he spoke of these concerns to each of Forward, Wilkinson and Zanker in early July 2014.
	
	
	Holder removed Jacob Munro from the Schofields site temporarily in early July 2014 and arranged accommodation for him in a caravan park at a Vineyard, about 25 minutes drive from the cannabis growing shed. Cameron urged Holder to keep Munro off the property and to pay him to keep quiet about the activities there. However Holder subsequently informed Cameron, Forward, Wilkinson and Zanker that he proposed to give Munro another chance.
	
	
	Cameron has said in a record of interview that about one week after the significant fight between Zanker and Munro in late June 2014, Zanker informed Cameron that he and Forward were willing to kill Jacob Munro. He has said that Zanker repeated this offer more than once at around this time and on one occasion did so with Forward also present. Forward at that time asked Cameron “Do you mind if it is messy?” Cameron said that he did not mind.
	
	
	That version of events conveys the impression that Zanker and Forward were the initiators of what became a concrete plan, hatched between them and Cameron, to kill Munro. On the other hand Forward has asserted in his record of interview that Cameron decided in early July 2014 that Munro had to be killed and, in effect, directed Forward that he should be the one to do it. Forward has said that he initially agreed, thinking that it would never happen but fearing to say no in case he should appear to be disloyal and become isolated as a potential risk to the group, thereby exposing himself to violent silencing measures.
	
	
	Neither Cameron nor Forward gave evidence in the sentence proceedings. Without hearing each of them tested under cross-examination I cannot resolve their conflicting accounts of who initiated the plan to kill and whether Forward was enthusiastic or reluctant. However these differences are not critical to evaluating the culpability of Cameron and Forward, respectively.
	
	
	Wilkinson heard Cameron, Forward and Zanker discussing that they would kill Munro. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that he did not take this literally and/or that he did not believe they that they would actually carry out such a plan. This is what Wilkinson had said in his interviews with police and, before that, in a letter he wrote on 12 January 2015. The letter was secreted in Wilkinson’s house with the intention that it should be found in the event of his death. He said the same thing as to his state of knowledge of the homicide plans in a conversation with Cameron’s wife at Casino on 13 January 2015. This conversation took place before his arrest on the charge of being an accessory to the murder and was detected by a listening device under warrant.
	
	
	On Saturday, 12 July 2014 Cameron arranged with Zanker and Forward to drive the next day to a location near Bulahdelah which Cameron had identified on a map as a potentially suitable place to bury the body of Jacob Munro after he had been killed. Early on the morning of Sunday 13 July Cameron drove in his own motor vehicle to a hardware store at Rouse Hill and purchased two spades, a mattock and three pairs of gloves. He then drove to Schofields and collected Zanker, pursuant to the arrangement he had made with him by phone the night before. Cameron drove, with Zanker as passenger, north to Gorokan on Tuggerah Lake. There Forward joined them and they continued toward Bulahdelah. During the drive north the three discussed the location which Cameron had identified on the map as a suitable burial place.
	
	
	Notably, Wilkinson did not accompany the other three on the grave digging venture. He wrote in the letter of 12 January 2015 to which reference has previously been made that Cameron, Forward and Zanker spoke amongst themselves in a jocular manner about having dug a grave for Munro. This was in the week before Munro was killed. I accept Wilkinson’s claim that he did not believe they were serious or that they would put the grave to use. This conclusion is consistent with him not having believed that any of the talk between Cameron, Forward and Zanker about killing Munro was in earnest.
	
	
	After passing through Bulahdelah township Cameron drove onto an unsealed road and stopped at a point along it where he thought the grave might be dug. The three men explored surrounding locations for about 20 minutes, agreed upon a place and proceeded to dig. At the end of this task Forward lay down in the grave briefly to ensure that it was of sufficient capacity to hold Jacob Munro’s body. The open grave was then covered with branches and the three men returned to Sydney.
	
	
	During the week following the grave digging of Sunday, 13 July 2014, Jacob Munro did not attend at the cannabis growing shed. On the evening of Monday 21 July 2014 Cameron learned that Munro would return to work the next day. At about 8:00 am on Tuesday, 22 July 2014 Cameron attended at the Vineyard caravan park where Jacob Munro was residing and met with him to drive him to the property at Schofields. On arrival there he let Munro into the shed, then went to the residence to wake Zanker. Forward arrived at the property at about this time. Wilkinson accompanied Cameron to the shed after Zanker had been woken. For about half an hour Cameron, Forward, Wilkinson and Jake Munro worked in the shed.
	
	
	Wilkinson and Munro sat on chairs near a table in what was known as the trimming room. There was a door connecting this room to the larger area of the shed. The table had cannabis plants spread out on it. Wilkinson and Munro were engaged in trimming them, seated side-by-side on chairs with their backs up against a wall. Forward and Cameron were also in the trimming room engaged on this work for a short time. They then left the room, Cameron first and Forward shortly after him. Forward at this stage took up a knife which he had brought to the shed the day before and with which he intended to kill Munro.
	
	
	I accept Wilkinson’s account of the attack upon Munro which then took place, given in his record of interview and during a walk-through of the shed with homicide detectives. Wilkinson had not been expecting the attack. Forward ran back in to the trimming room, straight up to Munro and delivered a punching or thrusting knife blow to his neck. Forward then ran out of the room into the adjoining part of the shed. Munro, although he must have been severely wounded, got up from his chair and ran out of the trimming room after Forward. I infer that he was trying to escape from the shed. Forward seized him by his clothes and delivered more knife blows. They went to the floor, wrestling, with Munro trying to gain control of the knife. Cameron was present in this part of the shed whilst the struggle was going on.
	
	
	Munro then collapsed onto a lounge chair which was located in the area where the attack by Forward upon Munro was continuing. Cameron applied a Taser to his head and delivered a burst of electric current. Forward grasped the handle of the knife in both hands and plunged it into Jacob Munro’s upper body with great force as Munro was slumped on the couch. Munro did not move again. Forward’s account of the attack in his record of interview is substantially to the same effect as that which I have summarised thus far from Wilkinson’s description. I find beyond reasonable doubt that the parts played by Forward and Cameron were as related in this and the preceding paragraph.
	
	
	After this Forward removed his own clothing and showered in a bathroom located within the shed. He changed into clean clothing and placed that which had been blood spattered during the attack in a black plastic bag for destruction later. Forward had sustained a deep cut to his right thumb and a laceration to a knuckle of his left hand whilst wielding the knife against Munro. These injuries were taped up in a temporary fashion. Cameron, Zanker and Wilkinson lifted Munro’s body onto some plastic sheet, wrapped the body up and placed it in the boot of Cameron’s motor vehicle.
	
	
	The floor of the shed upon which Munro had been standing when he was stabbed and to which he fell was concrete. Zanker applied bleach to the bloodstained surface and Cameron mopped up after him. Zanker and Cameron went through the pockets of the deceased and removed his phones and wallet. The phones were turned off so that their location could not be traced. They were discarded into rubbish bins remote from the Schofields shed. The wallet was similarly disposed of.
	
	
	Within half an hour to an hour after the deceased’s body had been loaded into the boot of Cameron’s car he drove it north to the prepared grave site near Bulahdelah. At Cameron’s request Wilkinson accompanied him as a passenger. Forward drove toward the site in his own car with Zanker. By arrangement between Cameron and Forward, the latter drove ahead in case there should be any random breath testing patrols along the highway. The offenders agreed that if there were such patrols there was a better chance of Cameron not being stopped and having his car searched if Forward preceded him.
	
	
	During the journey north Cameron stopped at a hardware store to purchase two bags of hydrated lime. Upon arrival at Bulahdelah township Forward parked his vehicle. He and Zanker then rode in Cameron’s car for the last part of the journey to the burial location. Upon arrival there the covering of branches was taken off the grave. Wilkinson assisted Cameron to carry the body to the grave. Lime was placed in the bottom of the grave, the body was lowered in and more lime was spread over the top.
	
	
	The grave was then backfilled by Cameron and Zanker. It was about 900 mm deep and approximately 15 m from the edge of the unsealed road. Forward did not take part in the burial but remained at the motor vehicle. His hand injuries would have prevented him from helping and he has said in his record of interview that he was shaken by what had taken place and felt unable to assist with the body. Wilkinson stood near the grave and observed the activities of Cameron and Zanker.
	
	
	The black plastic sheeting in which the body had been wrapped and a bag of Forward’s clothing were burned a few hundred metres from the burial site. All four men returned to Bulahdelah in Cameron’s motor vehicle. Whilst they were together they agreed that they would tell Holder and anyone else who might ask that Jacob Munro had never turned up for work at the shed that day. At Bulahdelah Forward returned to his own car and with Zanker as passenger they drove to Wyong Hospital where Forward obtained treatment for the cuts to his hands. Cameron drove Wilkinson back to Schofields. Consistently with their plan Cameron sent text messages to Holder either on the Tuesday evening or within subsequent days stating that Munro had not arrived at work. Zanker returned to work at the shed the next day. Forward did not return at any time after the murder up until the property was raided by Drug Squad officers on 27 July 2014.
	


Motives


	
	I find beyond reasonable doubt that Cameron’s motive for his participation in the killing of Jacob Munro was primarily to avoid detection of the cannabis growing enterprise. He was unable to persuade Holder, who was his partner with equal authority in the illegal business, to dismiss Munro from the property and to pay him for his silence. Because of Munro’s volatility in his conflict with Zanker, regardless of who was at fault in that conflict, Cameron perceived a risk that Munro would leave the cannabis growing business on bad terms and would leak information that could lead directly or indirectly to police detection. Cameron has admitted he was conscious of the likelihood that he would be sent to prison if he was detected in the activity. In this he was correct. In mid-2014, Cameron would have been acutely aware of his record, summarised at [58]. He was at the time on parole under a sentence imposed on the last occasion when he was caught growing cannabis, in 2009. He would have appreciated that if caught by police in the cultivation project upon which he was engaged in 2014 he would face many more years in prison.
	
	
	I find beyond reasonable doubt that Forward had the same motive as Cameron. I accept, on the balance of probabilities, that he also had some apprehension that once he had discussed with Cameron the plan to kill Munro he felt some pressure to go through with it lest he be perceived as a risk to Cameron and Zanker. I find that Forward believed Cameron, at least, would be capable of violence towards himself if Cameron thought it necessary in order to keep Forward quiet.
	
	
	It is not alleged by the Crown that Wilkinson shared the common purpose of the other three to kill Munro or that he was party to the plan in advance of Forward’s attack upon the deceased on 22 July 2014. I find beyond reasonable doubt that his motives in assisting the others to cover up the crime included avoidance of detection of his own involvement in the hydroponic cannabis cropping enterprise.
	
	
	In the intercepted conversation with Cameron’s wife in January 2015 Wilkinson stated that after the event he had been in possession of the murder weapon with the intention of disposing it at his property in northern New South Wales. However the bag in which he held it was searched during the execution of a warrant at Schofields by the Drug Squad on 27 July 2014. The knife was at that time seized, its significance not having been appreciated by the Drug Squad officers.
	
	
	I have accepted that Wilkinson was not aware that an attack upon Munro would really take place until it did, suddenly, in his presence on 22 July 2014. Once that had occurred he was faced with a difficult choice. He had just witnessed what his co-offenders were capable of. He was requested by Cameron to assist with transporting the body and burying it. Only by cooperating in this could he assure them of his involvement in the murder and hence that he was committed with them and not likely to speak to police. Hesitation on his part or any attempt to distance himself from the homicide would reveal him to the others as a risk. He may well have perceived that refusal to take part in the disposal of the body would expose him to elimination himself.
	
	
	Wilkinson asserts that after the murder he wished to leave the cannabis growing project as soon as possible and that he had packed his bags by the time the Drug Squad raided the property on 27 July 2014. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he intended to continue on at the cannabis cultivation shed, drawing his wage, or that his participation in disposing of the body can be seen as motivated to any extent by a cold desire to continue his illegal employment. I have accepted that his actions as an accessory were in part motivated by the wish to avoid detection for what he had already done at Schofields, up to 22 July 2014.
	


Objective seriousness of the murder


	
	Murder is in every instance a most serious crime. The maximum penalty of life imprisonment and the long sentences which are commonly imposed reflect the high value which the law places upon human life. Several features of the killing of Jacob Munro increase its gravity and attract a relatively high sentence for each of Cameron and Forward. First, it was thoroughly premeditated, with a bush grave being dug over a week in advance of the killing. This was not a spontaneous, passionate or angry reaction to any situation. It was a coldly planned elimination. I find beyond reasonable doubt that the grave was not merely dug in order to be available for a possible contingency, which might never arise. Cameron and Forward were resolved upon Jacob Munro’s death from the Sunday when they went to such considerable trouble to prepare the way for it.
	
	
	Through his record of interview and by way of the history he recounted to his psychologist, Forward has asserted that he adhered to the plan with reluctance and out of apprehension for Cameron’s reaction if he should withdraw. I cannot find on the balance of probabilities that his reservations were significant given that he had a full eight days after the grave was dug within which to reconsider before the knife attack was made. His conduct at the time speaks more forcefully than his words after the event. That a person of his age and background should be willing to be part of such a plan is surprising but on the evidence I cannot be satisfied that he was not willing.
	
	
	Secondly, the purpose of the murder was to silence a potentially loose talking participant in the criminal cultivation activity. An abrasive, volatile and at times violent employee could, in the setting of a legitimate business, be worked around in any of a number of ways. His co-workers could continue to urge the principal who had hired him (Holder) to dismiss him. Alternatively they could make life so unpleasant for Munro as to drive him to resignation. They could leave the employment themselves. None of these solutions would work for the offenders because any of the alternatives would likely result in word getting out through Munro about the hydroponic cannabis operation. Jacob Munro was killed to enable the offenders to avoid detection of their illegal activity to date and, at least in Cameron’s case, to enable continuation of the large-scale commercial production of the prohibited drug.
	
	
	Thirdly, this may properly be regarded as a murder for financial gain from Cameron’s point of view. Although he did not seek to take money or property directly from the victim, his purpose involved the continuance of the hydroponic cultivation enterprise and the derivation of unlawful profits from it. For the purpose of comparing the facts of this case with those upon which other murderers have been sentenced, this homicide was in principle similar to cases where a witness to an offence such as robbery has been murdered to help the murderer retain the proceeds of the original crime and avoid being brought to justice for it.
	
	
	Fourthly, the murder was extremely brutal in the manner in which was carried out. A stabbing death such as this one is a savage, painful drawn out affair. It was particularly so because multiple blows were necessary to kill the victim. Jacob Munro died struggling for his life so far as he could whilst rendered largely helpless by the Taser shock administered by Cameron. With respect to Forward, I accept that the brutality and prolongation of the attack, involving 15 separate wounds, was not the product of innate savagery on his part but of his inexperience in violent struggles and his own fear and desperation once he had commenced.
	
	
	Fifthly the offenders acted callously towards relatives and friends of the deceased. His elimination left them to wonder whether or not he had died and if so for what reason and in what circumstances. They were left with no last remains to grieve over, to inter or to cremate.
	
	
	Sixthly, the murder was committed in company. By s 21A(2)(e) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act this is an aggravating feature which I must take into account. Other statutory aggravating features listed in s 21A(2) have already been considered in these remarks or are inapplicable. Some of the statutory factors are inherent in the crime of murder and cannot be separately considered without double counting, for example par (b) of s 21A(2).
	
	
	The degree of objective culpability for the offence differs between Cameron and Forward. Both took part in discussion of the plan from its first conception. Thereafter Cameron led and drove the implementation. He selected the method of disposing of the body and the site where the grave would be dug. He arranged with the others the grave digging trip. He bought the tools and led the expedition. He instructed Forward as to the day the murder was to take place and gave him the go-ahead. Cameron participated in the act of killing by immobilising the victim with electric current from the Taser whilst the younger man, Forward, did the heavy work of wielding the knife. Cameron directed operations with respect to transporting and concealing the body.
	
	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the plan would not have been made and would not have proceeded to implementation without Cameron’s assent, leadership and direction. He was one of two principals of the illegal enterprise which was to be protected by the killing. He was Forward’s boss in that business. He was older than Forward and had authority over him. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the plan to kill could have been stopped by Cameron at any time.
	
	
	For his part, Forward gave his assent to the plan and participated with his full share of the physical work. He helped dig the grave, he stabbed the victim and he took part in transporting the body by driving ahead to screen Cameron’s car from police attention. So far as the evidence shows, he was the only one of the three who was prepared to carry out the final attack so that his involvement also was indispensable to the commission of the murder.
	
	
	Aggravated as this murder was I do not consider it to have been in the worst category of particularly heinous homicides such as to demand imprisonment for life. Further, the ameliorating subjective circumstances of each of Cameron and Forward, to be mentioned shortly, and their entitlement to reduction of sentence under s 22 and other provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act tell against life imprisonment.
	


Victim impact statement


	
	In fixing sentence for Cameron and Forward for the murder I will have regard to a victim impact statement by the deceased’s mother, Ms Deborah Hall, read to the Court on her behalf. Ms Hall has been devastated by the loss of her son and by the shocking circumstances of his death and burial. Her statement described the understandably deep effect the events have had on her other children. Ms Hall’s statement concluded with a compassionate recognition of the effects of these crimes upon the families of the offenders, a profound demonstration of her own humanity and strength of character.
	


Objective seriousness of Wilkinson’s accessory role


	
	As for Wilkinson, it is fair to say that his assistance as an accessory after the fact was not strictly necessary to the implementation of the burial plan made by the others. It has been recognised that disposal of a body is a most serious manner of providing assistance to a murderer after the fact: R v Quach [2002] NSWSC 1205 at [11]. Obviously, circumstances of an offender’s involvement in the disposal of a body may vary greatly from one case to the next. A survey of cases illustrating the range of circumstances was made by Buddin J in R v Cowen [2008] NSWSC 104.
	
	
	Here, the disposal would have occurred in the way that it did with or without Wilkinson’s cooperation. He added very little except to keep his silence about a murder which had been perpetrated in his presence without prior knowledge that it would occur and without any choice on his part as to being present. This is in contrast to the facts in R v Quach where the offender was the only person on hand to assist a murderer in disposing of the body of his victim and where concealment of the crime would not have been possible without the accessory’s contribution.
	
	
	Nevertheless Wilkinson’s offence must attract a term of full-time custody. The significant consideration in this is the requirement for general deterrence, having regard to the policy of the law as referred to by Thomas J of the Supreme Court of Queensland in R v Hawken (1986) 27 A Crim R 32 at 38:
	


“… it is in the interests of the community that murderers should be completely isolated from support and deprived of assistance and that such crimes be not covered up. The severe penalty available against accessories after the fact is a way in which the community protects itself and it is an aspect of the law's general deterrence against homicide.”

Arrest of the offenders for cannabis cultivation


	
	At some time in July 2014 New South Wales police attached to the State Crime Command Drug Squad had commenced investigations into possible cultivation of cannabis at the Schofields property. On 27 July 2014 surveillance was conducted on the shed and on vehicles driving to it and from it. During that day a search warrant for the property was executed. Police found within the shed a sophisticated two level, multi-room cannabis plantation. Each room was walled with insulated plywood. Cultivation of cannabis plants was being enhanced by artificial lighting and an irrigation system. A large amount of chemical fertiliser was found within the shed. Cannabis plants at various stages of growth were located and there was a significant amount of harvested cannabis laid out on racks in the process of being dried.
	
	
	Holder, Cameron and Wilkinson were arrested on charges of being knowingly concerned in the cultivation. Holder and Cameron have since that time remained in custody on this charge, bail refused. Wilkinson was released on bail soon after his arrest. Neither Forward nor Zanker was immediately arrested for his part in the cannabis cultivation. Forward had not returned to the Schofields shed by the date of the police raid which was only five days after the murder.
	
	
	On 28 July 2014 an agronomist working with police identified in the Schofields shed 664 cannabis plants at various stages of growth, comprised of 598 plants in plastic pots and 66 plants in rockwool blocks on propagation trays. Police have estimated that all of the plants identified, when fully grown, could yield a crop with a maximum street value of $2.99 million.
	


Objective seriousness of the cannabis cultivation


	
	As described at [5] – [9] and [51] the cannabis cultivation project at Schofields was highly organised and equipped for high-volume continuous production. Cameron’s role as one of two partners who stood to reap the profits constituted an offence against s 23(2)(a) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act in the mid range of gravity. One can envisage more serious offending against this section with more plants and more workers. For hydroponic cultivation the threshold for the large commercial quantity is 200 plants. Approximately 3½ times that number were being grown at Schofields in July 2014. This was cannabis production on at least a light industrial scale.
	
	
	Cameron has not been separately charged with the periodic supplies, by way of delivery to Port Macquarie, as referred to at [7]. That aspect of the activity is taken into account only as indicating the commercial nature of the enterprise, the degree to which it was established and the recurrent nature of the planting, cultivation and harvesting. Cameron’s offending is comparable to that which was considered in Licastro v R [2008] NSWCCA 131.
	
	
	The offending by each of Forward and Wilkinson was of a very much lower order. They were mere employees at relatively low rates of remuneration. There is no evidence that they shared in profits. Forward’s conduct was somewhat more serious than that of Wilkinson because he was involved over a longer period.
	
	
	For each offender the aggravating factor referred to in par (n) of s 21A(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act applies: the cannabis cultivation was a part of a planned and organised activity. Also, par (o) is engaged: the cultivation was for financial gain. This is an aggravating circumstance, not a feature inherent in the offence. Although the section infringed is concerned with a “large commercial quantity”, it is not in every case that the plants falling within that statutory term are grown for profit. In some such cases it has been found that a large commercial quantity was grown for personal use but that was clearly not so at the Schofields shed.
	


Cameron’s antecedents, subjective circumstances and plea


	
	Cameron’s criminal record shows that he has been a persistent offender with respect to the cultivation of cannabis and is entitled to no lenience on the cultivation charge to which he has now pleaded. The dates of his prior drug offences and the penalties he has received are as follows:
	



	
	February 1996 (age 44): cultivate cannabis, periodic detention 9 months.
	
	
	October 2002 (age 50): cultivate cannabis, imprisonment for 2 years non-parole period and 12 months balance of term; supply cannabis, imprisonment for 12 months to be served concurrently.
	
	
	January 2003 (age 50): cultivate cannabis, imprisonment for 2 years non-parole period and 2 years balance of term. This offence was committed on 29 January 2003 whilst Cameron was on bail in respect of the October 2002 charges. The October 2002 and January 2003 matters were disposed of together, the imprisonment for the latter being made cumulative by 6 months upon the imprisonment for the former.
	
	
	July 2009 (age 57): cultivate cannabis, imprisonment for 3 years and 6 months non-parole period and 1 year 9 months balance of term. A further offence of supplying cannabis was the subject of imprisonment for 12 months to be served concurrently.
	



	
	This record demonstrates that Cameron has no regard for the law which prohibits the cultivation of prohibited plants. He may fairly be said to be defiant of it and incorrigible with respect to this form of offending. It has been mentioned that at the time of the cultivation offence for which he is now to be sentenced he was still on parole for the 2009 offences. I find that upon release from the imprisonment which is now to be imposed Cameron would be strongly inclined to return to cultivating cannabis except for the fact that he would not likely be physically able to do so having regard to the age at which release can be expected. On the other hand Cameron’s record discloses no prior offences of violence or of anything relevant to the manner in which he should be dealt with for the murder. I consider it unlikely he would commit any further offence of violence.
	
	
	Cameron did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings but there was tendered on his behalf a report of Dr Nielssen, psychiatrist, dated 17 August 2016. This contains the only evidence available to me of Cameron’s personal background. The report includes reference to a summary of events provided by his wife. Cameron’s parents separated when he was very young. For most of his childhood and early teens he was raised by grandparents who at times administered harsh physical punishments. He left school at 15 years of age and was employed in unskilled occupations until he joined the army. He served for a few years and was discharged in 1977 at age 25. Shortly afterwards he married. Cameron and his wife have a son and a daughter both now in their mid 30s. The marriage has held together notwithstanding his incarceration from time to time as summarised at [58].
	
	
	Cameron has been a gambler. He has overused alcohol at times. He has not been a perpetual cannabis user. He claims to have been intoxicated by THC absorbed through his skin and through the air he breathed whilst he was working in the hydroponic shed at Schofields. I cannot accept that evidence or draw any conclusion as to whether he was drug affected at any time relevant to the murder. There is no expert opinion evidence before me capable of establishing that absorption of THC by the means which Cameron describes is possible.
	
	
	All of Cameron’s background personal circumstances, apart from his criminal record, are unremarkable and neutral in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. Dr Nielsen considers that Cameron is now affected by a depressive disorder which, again, is unremarkable and neutral to sentence. His arrest, incarceration and expectation of a long prison term are no doubt depressing influences.
	
	
	According to Dr Nielssen’s report Cameron told the doctor he did not think about the murder “until a few months after I was picked up” (on 27 July 2014, for the cannabis cultivation) but after that he was “tormented by memories and feelings of guilt about what happened”. He said to Dr Nielssen: “I abhor violence. … I was a mess after [I] was arrested and I had to get it off my chest”.
	
	
	I accept these statements concerning the development of his reflections upon the murder. His volunteering of information about the crime to police, commencing in mid-December 2014, is consistent with and tends to corroborate them. The absence of any criminal record of violent offending or other evidence of past violent conduct is also consistent with his assertions to Dr Nielssen. Cameron has shown genuine remorse with respect to the murder.
	
	
	Cameron pleaded guilty to both the murder and cannabis cultivation charges in the Local Court on 29 January 2016. He should have a 25% reduction of the sentences which would otherwise be appropriate.
	


Cameron’s assistance to authorities


	
	Following his arrest on 27 July 2014 on the charge of cultivating a large commercial quantity of cannabis plants, Cameron was refused bail. On 16 December 2014 he informed police through his solicitor that he wished to speak to them. When police contacted him he said he had information concerning Jacob Munro, whose disappearance police had been investigating since 27 July 2014. On that date Munro’s girlfriend had reported him missing.
	
	
	On 17 December 2014 Cameron took part in a record of interview with homicide detectives over one and a half hours. In this he described the stabbing of Munro by Forward as having taken place spontaneously and, from his point of view, unexpectedly on the morning of 22 July 2014. He volunteered that he had used the Taser but said this had been to subdue Munro in circumstances where he thought Munro was wielding the knife. He did not inform police that a grave for Munro had been dug over a week earlier. He admitted that he and Wilkinson drove the body to the burial site near Bulahdelah and that Forward and Zanker had also attended, in Forward’s vehicle. However he suggested that the selection of the site was made only after the killing had occurred, without pre-planning.
	
	
	On 19 December 2014 Cameron voluntarily attended the burial site with homicide detectives and participated in a walk-through. This was electronically recorded. He identified the area where he, Forward, Zanker and Wilkinson had buried the deceased’s body. He directed police to an area about 500 m to the south where the plastic sheet in which Munro’s body had been wrapped and clothing worn by Forward during the homicide were burned. It was during this walk-through that he first informed police that the grave had been dug days prior to the killing.
	
	
	During 19 and 20 December 2014 New South Wales police forensic service officers exhumed the remains of the deceased from the grave. Post-mortem examination showed that he had been stabbed 15 times to the face, neck, back and chest. One stab wound had penetrated the deceased’s heart.
	
	
	On 29 January 2015 Cameron made a statement to police in which he retracted the falsehoods in his record of interview as summarised at [67]. His account in this statement included the planning in advance that had been undertaken between himself, Forward and Zanker, the selection of the burial site and the preparation of the grave more than a week before Munro was stabbed to death. The statement was adopted on 16 February 2015. On 29 January 2015, when providing information for the statement, Cameron marked up the transcript of the record of interview in which he had participated on 17 December 2014 to indicate portions which were untruthful or inaccurate.
	
	
	For the purposes of s 23(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I have considered a confidential exhibit which sets out the police view of the nature, utility, completeness and truthfulness of Cameron’s assistance to authorities. I accept that without that assistance police would probably not have located the deceased’s body. It is not said, by police or by Cameron, that the murder would not have been uncovered and solved without his help. Nevertheless I accept that the information he supplied greatly expedited the investigation. Relatively speaking, the provision of the information was timely. It enabled all co-offenders to be apprehended and charged. As a result of Cameron’s assistance it has been necessary for him to be placed in protective custody and this restricts his access to programs within the correctional facility where he is located and otherwise isolates him during his imprisonment.
	
	
	By reason of this assistance I will discount the sentence which otherwise I would have imposed on Cameron for the murder by 15%, in addition to the discount to which he is entitled for his plea of guilty. One factor which I have considered in arriving at this percentage is that the risks to which Cameron has exposed himself by his co-operation, in particular risks of harm by associates, are not nearly as great as in other cases where higher discounts for co-operation have been allowed. Cameron has also cooperated with police in relation to the cultivation charge but I do not consider that this warrants any discount to his sentence for that offence. The case against Cameron, Holder and Wilkinson with respect to the cannabis cultivation was overwhelming from the moment of their arrest at the site, without any input from Cameron. Wilkinson had already provided information against Zanker in relation to the activities at Schofields before Cameron spoke to police about that. So far as information from Cameron may have assisted in proving a case against Forward for his involvement in the cannabis enterprise, this is not of great significance in itself and is really an incidental outcome of the information provided in respect of the murder.
	


Forward’s antecedents, subjective circumstances and plea


	
	Forward has no record of convictions for any offence committed prior to the date of the murder. He is an intelligent person and was promising as a junior school pupil. His progress at school was impeded from an early stage by serious ill health. By the age of 14 years he had fallen far behind in physical development and was well below the 1st percentile for height for his age group. He was at that time diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, an inflammatory disorder of the bowel. Treatment for this during his high school years and absences due to symptoms prevented him from achieving the intellectual and scholastic development of which he would have been capable.
	
	
	Forward abused alcohol heavily from the age of 15. He became a heavy user of cannabis by age 17. His mother, although aware of the problem and very concerned about it, could not break him of the habit. He has used ecstasy, amphetamines and cocaine since he was 18. He left school without completing year 12. Thereafter he had only temporary, part-time, unskilled employment in retail up to the time when he commenced work at Schofields.
	
	
	I accept on the balance of probabilities Forward’s explanation of how he came to be involved with the cultivation enterprise, as given in his record of interview on 23 March 2016. He was unemployed in late 2013 and was using cannabis daily. He ran up a debt of about $2000 to his supplier. As a means of him earning income from which to pay off this debt, the supplier introduced him to Cameron who then employed him at the Schofields cultivation site. He had paid off the debt within about four or five weeks but then continued in the cultivation business, earning about $200 per day.
	
	
	Forward has expressed to his psychiatrist remorse, recognition of the gravity of his wrongdoing and acceptance of responsibility, including sympathy for the family of the deceased. The psychiatrist considers that at the time of the murder “his reasoning process was likely impaired by substance intoxication (with greater impulsivity), and to a lesser extent the negative style of his depressive thinking”. I accept that conclusion. It provides no significant reduction in culpability but, with respect to his decision to participate in the murder, it constitutes a partial explanation which leaves open significant prospect of rehabilitation provided he can abstain from substance abuse after his release.
	
	
	I take into account that Forward is a young offender being sentenced to imprisonment for the first time so that amelioration of sentence is appropriate to afford an opportunity for rehabilitation. Another factor warranting mitigation of penalty is that Forward’s ongoing suffering of the symptoms of Crohn’s disease will make his time in custody particularly difficult. The Justice Health record of his treatment to date whilst on remand bears this out.
	
	
	Forward was arrested on 27 February 2015 for the murder and at that time refused to take part in a record of interview. He offered a plea of guilty to murder on 4 December 2015 in the Local Court, when he was committed for sentence. His first appearance in the arraignment list in this Court was on 4 March 2016. On 23 March 2016 he took part in a record of interview with homicide detectives and gave an account of his involvement in the murder.
	
	
	Forward had not been charged in connection with the cultivation of cannabis at Schofields up to the time of his arrest for the murder. That charge was first laid on 27 February 2015. He offered a plea of guilty to that, also, on 4 December 2015 in the Local Court. He should have a 25% reduction of whatever sentence would otherwise be imposed, under s 22 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	


Forward’s assistance to authorities


	
	For the purposes of s 23 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act I have considered a confidential exhibit in which the officer in charge of the murder investigation has acknowledged the utility, truthfulness and completeness of information supplied by Forward in his record of interview of 23 March 2016. Forward is willing to give evidence against Zanker. It is primarily in relation to the prosecution of Zanker that Forward’s evidence will be of utility although a strong case would exist against Zanker without Forward’s assistance, upon evidence which can be given by Cameron and Wilkinson who provided their assistance to authorities earlier in time. It is nevertheless appropriate to allow some discount under s 23 with respect to sentence on the murder charge, in addition to the discount which he will receive for his plea of guilty in the Local Court. I consider an additional 5% to be appropriate.
	
	
	There is no reason to discount Forward’s sentence on the cultivation charge pursuant to s 23. Anything he may say about his own or any other person’s involvement in that is well provable by the Crown independently of him. I accept that Forward will be at some risk of hostility from other inmates within the prison system by reason of his cooperation with authorities. He has not sought or accepted protective custody. I take into account that his co-operation in giving evidence is at a cost to himself of added stress which is adverse to the management of his bowel disease. It is the limited utility of his assistance which most influences the level of discount that can be allowed in his case.
	


Wilkinson’s antecedents, subjective circumstances and plea


	
	Wilkinson has a small number of minor offences on his record but none are relevant for present purposes. There is nothing in his record which would disentitle him from lenience if it can otherwise be extended.
	
	
	Information concerning his personal history comes from a psychologist’s report prepared for the purpose of sentence proceedings. He came to Australia with his family as a four-year-old. He was educated to the age of 15 years at which time his father died and he left school. Wilkinson worked in a variety of unskilled and semi trade occupations. He had an unstable marriage over 16 years which produced one son from whom he is estranged. Wilkinson’s health is poor. He had bypass surgery in about 2013 to address coronary artery disease. He remains anxious and physically weakened as a result of this.
	
	
	I consider it unlikely that Wilkinson would offend seriously again. He has expressed regret for his actions which I accept as genuine.
	
	
	Wilkinson denied knowing that Munro was missing when asked about him by police on 3 September 2014. At that time Wilkinson provided a statement in which he admitted that he had worked at the crop site with Holder, Cameron, Zanker, Forward and Munro. On 28 October 2014 and 19 November 2014 Wilkinson was again spoken to by police and on both occasions claimed to have no information concerning the deceased’s disappearance.
	
	
	Wilkinson was arrested on 25 February 2015 on the charge of having been an accessory after the fact to the murder of Munro. Up until then he was on bail in relation to the cultivation charge. He has been in custody since 25 February 2015. He pleaded guilty to both charges in the local Court on 4 December 2015 and is entitled to a 25% reduction of his sentence for each offence on that account.
	


Wilkinson’s assistance to authorities


	
	At the time of his arrest on the accessory to murder charge Wilkinson indicated to police an area behind a set of drawers in his home. Police there located two envelopes, one addressed to Holder and the other to the Missing Persons Squad. Each of these envelopes contained a copy of the letter of 12 January 2015, referred to at [16], outlining the circumstances of the murder of Jacob Munro and the disposal of his body. Wilkinson stated that his intention in preparing and concealing these letters was that he believed if he died they would be found.
	
	
	Following Wilkinson’s arrest on 25 February 2015 on the charge of having been an accessory after the fact to the murder of Munro, Wilkinson gave police useful information in relation to the prosecution of Forward (who did not admit his involvement until 13 months later) and relevant to the prosecution of Zanker for murder. I accept that this information has been and will continue to be of significant utility to the Crown. I consider that a 10% discount under s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is appropriate in relation to Wilkinson’s sentence on the accessory to murder charge.
	
	
	The assistance provided by Wilkinson in relation to the cannabis cultivation, as described in a confidential exhibit prepared by the officer in charge of the investigation, was given promptly, on 31 July 2014, and was substantial. Again a discount of 10%, additional to the 25% which he will receive for his early plea of guilty, is in my view appropriate in relation to penalty on the cannabis cultivation charge.
	


Cameron: sentence


	
	Cameron has been in custody from his arrest up to today’s date. To allow the time served to count the first of the sentences imposed on these charges will commence on 27 July 2014, the date of arrest. I consider that there should be some accumulation of the sentences for the two offences respectively because they are quite distinct in the nature of the criminality involved. Also, having regard to his egregious record with respect to cannabis cultivation his punishment for the current offence of that nature cannot be allowed merely to merge in his punishment for the murder.
	
	
	Were it not for the 25% discount to which Cameron has become entitled by his plea to the cannabis cultivation charge I would have sentenced him to a non-parole period of 10 years and a balance of term of 3 years and 4 months. It is redundant to fix a balance of term. Following the expiration of his non-parole period for the cultivation he will remain in custody under his sentence for the murder charge. Despite the redundancy it appears I am obliged, by the operation of ss 44 and 45 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, to fix both a non-parole period and a balance of term.
	
	
	In relation to the murder charge I find no special circumstances for the purposes of s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which would warrant altering the statutory ratio between non-parole period and balance of term. The starting point, to which there must be applied the combined discount of 40% to which I consider Cameron entitled, would be a non-parole period of 30 years and a balance of term according to the statutory ratio.
	
	
	Applying the discounts and taking into account all of the considerations I have mentioned, the offender is sentenced as follows:
	



	
	For the offence of knowing concern in the cultivation of prohibited plants being not less than the large commercial quantity of such plants at Schofields on 27 July 2014 Donald John Cameron is sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months to commence on 27 July 2014 and to expire on 26 January 2022 and a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months to commence on 27 January 2022 and to expire on 26 July 2024.
	
	
	For the murder of Jacob Munro at Schofields on 22 July 2014 Donald John Cameron is sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 18 years to commence on 27 July 2018 and to expire on 26 July 2036 and a balance of term of 6 years to commence on 27 July 2036 and to expire on 26 July 2042.
	
	
	Donald John Cameron will be eligible for release on parole at the expiry of the non-parole period in respect of the offence of murder.
	


Forward: sentence


	
	Stanley Robert Forward has been in custody from his arrest up to today’s date. To allow the time served to count the sentences imposed upon him will commence on 27 February 2015, the date of arrest. The starting point for the cannabis cultivation charge, before the discount of 25% for his plea of guilty, would be an overall term of four years with a non-parole period and balance of term in the statutory proportion.
	
	
	With respect to the sentence of Forward for murder I find special circumstances within the meaning of s 44 which warrant altering the ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of term. Forward’s youth, his being in prison for the first time at such a young age, his medical condition and requirements for treatment, his prospects of rehabilitation and the potential benefit of an extended period of rehabilitation in the community after his release are factors which justify the variation. Because of the discount to which he is entitled on the sentence for this charge, the balance of term under parole which results from varying the statutory ratio does not become excessive. The starting point for his sentence before application of the 30% discount would be a non-parole period of 22 years and a balance of term of 8 years.
	
	
	There are factors which distinguish the position of Forward from that of each of the other offenders with respect to accumulation. Because of his youth and the prospects of his rehabilitation it is important that the overall effective sentence, whilst adequately reflecting the gravity of his actions, should not be crushing. As he is to serve a significant term for the murder and as his criminality in the cannabis cultivation was in a subordinate capacity and of relatively low culpability, I consider it appropriate to fix the sentences on both charges to be served concurrently.
	
	
	Allowing for the discounts to which he is entitled and giving due weight to all other considerations to which I have referred the offender is sentenced as follows:
	



	
	For the offence of knowing concern in the cultivation of prohibited plants being not less than the large commercial quantity of such plants at Schofields on 27 July 2014 Stanley Robert Forward is sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months to commence on 27 February 2015 and to expire on 26 May 2017 and a balance of term of 9 months to commence 27 May 2017 and to expire 26 February 2018.
	
	
	For the murder of Jacob Munro at Schofields on 22 July 2014 Stanley Robert Forward is sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 15 years and 5 months to commence on 27 February 2015 and to expire on 26 July 2030 and a balance of term of 5 years and 7 months to commence on 27 July 2030 and to expire on 26 February 2036.
	
	
	Stanley Robert Forward will be eligible for release on parole at the expiry of the non-parole period in respect of the offence of murder.
	



	
	Notwithstanding s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act I will not make an order for release of the offender at the expiration of his non-parole period in relation to the cannabis cultivation charge. To do so would create confusion for Corrective Services because he will at that time remain subject to the non-parole period in respect of the murder.
	


Wilkinson: sentence


	
	David Ian Wilkinson has been in custody from his arrest up to today’s date. To allow the time served to count the first sentence imposed will commence on 25 February 2015, the date of arrest. There must be some degree of accumulation between the sentences. I see no special circumstances warranting adjustment of the statutory ratio between non-parole period and balance of term, for the sentence on either count.
	
	
	In respect of the cannabis cultivation, the starting point to which it is appropriate to apply a 35% discount by reason of Wilkinson’s pleas of guilty and the other matters identified in these remarks would be an overall sentence of 3 years and 9 months. For the accessory to murder charge, where a 35% discount is also to be allowed, the starting point would be an overall sentence of 2 years and 4 months.
	
	
	Upon application of the reductions in sentence to which I find him entitled, the offender is sentenced as follows:
	



	
	For the offence of knowing concern in the cultivation of prohibited plants being not less than the large commercial quantity of such plants at Schofields on 27 July 2014 David Ian Wilkinson is sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 1 year and 10 months to commence on 25 February 2015 and to expire on 24 December 2016 and a balance of term of 7 months to commence on 25 December 2016 and to expire on 24 July 2017.
	
	
	For the offence of being an accessory after the fact to the murder of Jacob Munro at Schofields on 22 July 2014 David Ian Wilkinson is sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 1 year and 2 months to commence on 25 November 2015 and to expire on 24 January 2017 and a balance of term of 4 months to commence on 25 January 2017 and to expire on 24 May 2017.
	
	
	David Ian Wilkinson is to be released on parole at the expiry of the non-parole period of his sentence in respect of the offence of accessory after the fact to murder.
	



	
	Notwithstanding s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act no order is made for release of the offender Wilkinson at the expiration of his non-parole period in relation to the cultivation of prohibited plants because he will at that time continue to serve a non-parole period in respect of the accessory to murder offence.
	


Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act


	
	Pursuant to s 25C(1) of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) all three offenders are notified that the provisions of the Act apply to them and to the offending the subject of these proceedings.

		18 September 2017",2016-09-21 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2240349,Regina v Jay Lindsay John Curtis-Hodge [2016] NSWDC 222,"sentence


	
	Jay Curtis-Hodge (the offender) appears for sentence after he pleaded guilty in the Local Court to one count of robbery in company contrary to section 97 Crimes Act 1900 and one count of drive recklessly in a police pursuit contrary to section 51B Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the robbery offence is 20 years imprisonment.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the police pursuit offence is 3 years imprisonment. A conviction for that offence also carries with it an automatic licence disqualification of 3 years, reducible to a minimum of 12 months.
	
	
	The offender has also been called up for the breach of 6 good behaviour bonds, by reason of his plea of guilty to the matters on which he appears for sentence. The offender consents to this Court dealing with the breach of the bonds imposed in the Local Court.
	
	
	On 17 February 2014, his Honour Magistrate McAnulty sitting at Leeton Local Court ordered the offender to enter 4 good behaviour bonds pursuant to section 9 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 for the offences of Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm, Common Assault, Stalk/Intimidate with intent to cause fear of physical or mental harm and Drive in a manner dangerous.
	
	
	On 22 October 2014 the offender was sentenced to 2 terms of 15 months imprisonment for offences of Stalk/Intimidate with intent to cause fear of physical or mental harm, by her Honour Judge English sitting at Wagga Wagga. Those terms of imprisonment were suspended on condition that the offender enter into a good behaviour bond pursuant to section 12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, for the period of 15 months.
	
	
	It is appropriate to deal with the breach of the good behaviour bonds first, so that issues of accumulation and totality can be properly considered: R v Dinh [2010] NSWCCA 74.

Facts of the matters giving rise to the section 9 bonds


	
	The victim Sarah Temple and the offender had been in a domestic relationship over a 6 year period. They had 3 children together aged 3, 2 and 7 months (the baby) at the time of the offences. They lived in rented accommodation in Leeton.
	
	
	On Sunday 13 October 2013 the victim awoke and found that items of her property were missing. At about 11.30am the offender returned home and there was an argument. The victim left the house intending to walk to the police station to report the offender’s behaviour. The victim took the baby with her. The older children were being cared for by others at the time.
	
	
	When she was walking past a residential property the victim saw the offender approaching her in a vehicle. The victim fearing a confrontation with the offender retreated to the front yard of the property. The offender stopped the vehicle in the driveway of the property. He said to her, “Get in the fucken car Sarah now, they will ring the coppers”. The victim refused. The offender got out of the vehicle and approached the victim and said, “Get in the fucken car, I’ll fucken kill you, I’ll take your son”. The offender repeated words to that effect, a number of occasions. The victim noticed that there was another man in the front passenger seat, Mitchell Crowe a relative of the offender. Mr Crowe said to the offender, “Just leave her”. The victim left the front yard and continued to walk towards the police station. The offender followed her in the vehicle.
	
	
	About 100m further down the road the offender drove in front of the victim and blocked her path by reversing the vehicle onto a dirt driveway. Mr Crowe was no longer in the vehicle but was on the street with his girlfriend Ms Kilby. The offender got out of the driver’s seat and walked to the rear passenger door, where the victim was. The offender grabbed the victim by her left arm and twisted her arm up behind her back. At the same time he used his other hand to try to take the baby from her arms. The offender said, “Let go of him or I’ll snap your arm, I’ll fucken snap your arm Sarah”. The victim was crying and experiencing pain in her arm. The offender continued to apply force to her arm for a further 10 seconds. The pain in her arm continued for 10 minutes after he released her.
	
	
	Mr Crowe and Ms Kilby approached. Mr Crowe tried to reason with the offender to leave. Arrangements were made for the baby to go with Mr Crowe and Ms Kilby and they crossed the street. The victim walked in the same direction. The offender reversed the vehicle onto the grass traffic island in the middle of the street. The offender said, “Get the fuck in the car Sarah”. The victim refused. The offender grabbed the victim by the hair and pulled her towards the vehicle.
	
	
	The victim fearing for her safety got in the rear seat of the vehicle, behind the offender. Mr Crowe got in the front passenger seat. Ms Kilby left on foot with the baby. The offender drove in the direction of their house. The victim said, “Take me to my son”. The offender replied, “You don’t get it do you, you’re never going to see your son again, I’m going to knock you”. The victim took this to mean that the offender was going to kill her. The offender accelerated to about 90km per hour in a 60 km/hour zone whilst saying, “I’m taking you to the bush to knock you, you’re never seeing the kids again”. The victim tried to get out of the vehicle but could not do so because the child lock was engaged. The victim lowered the window and partially opened the door from the outside. The offender swung his left arm around and reached out for the victim, grabbing her t-shirt around the left sleeve causing it to tear whilst continuing to drive at speed.
	
	
	A short distance further the offender turned right down a dirt access road and slowed the vehicle. The victim jumped out of the vehicle landing on the ground. The vehicle came to a stop a further 2m away. The offender yelled at the victim, “Get the fuck back in the car”. The victim refused. As she was still getting up the offender said, “I’ll fucken run you over then”. The offender reversed the vehicle until it was about 4m away from the victim. He then drove the vehicle forwards towards the victim. The victim stood up and ran to the front left hand side of the vehicle. The vehicle came within an arms-length of her. Fearing for her safety the victim ran through a small park . The offender ran after the victim and continued yelling at her. The victim continued to walk to the police station to report the incident. On the way she saw Ms Kilby who returned the baby to her. The victim was left with marks on her neck.
	
	
	The victim reported the matter to the police. The offender could not be located.
	


Facts of the matters giving rise to the section 12 bonds


	
	The victims, Wesley Whiteman and Tiana Byrnes lived in a domestic relationship in Young. Mr Whiteman was known to the offender.
	
	
	At about 11.15am on Saturday 9 November 2013 the offender came to the victims’ house, with a co-offender. Mr Whiteman invited the offender and co-offender into the kitchen, where Ms Byrnes was seated at the kitchen bench.
	
	
	The offender became aggressive and in the course of the conversation, the offender said to Mr Whiteman, “Give me one good reason why I shouldn’t break your fucking jaw?” Mr Whiteman replied, “Whoa mate I have no idea what you’re talking about”. At the same time he raised his hands with his palms facing towards the offender.
	
	
	The offender then put his left hand behind his back and stood up, producing a syringe. He said, “Give me all your fucking money”. Ms Byrnes picked up a pair of scissors and held them in front of her. Mr Whiteman said, “I don’t have any fucking money”.
	
	
	Mr Whiteman ran to the lounge room and told his 10 year old step-daughter to take his 19 month old son to the bedroom. The co-offender was standing in the hallway. The co-offender said to Mr Whiteman, “Get back in the kitchen, he’s skitzing out”. Mr Whiteman replied, “Get out of my house you fucking dog”. The co-offender said, “Get out in the kitchen, he wants your money”. Mr Whiteman said, “No!”
	
	
	At this time the co-offender walked out the front door. Mr Whiteman followed him outside. Ms Byrnes left the kitchen and locked the front door to prevent the offender following Mr Whiteman. The offender said to Ms Byrnes, if you don’t open the door I’m going to stab you with the syringe, I have Hep C and I am not scared to give it to you or anyone else. You don’t know what I’ve got in this”.
	
	
	The offender continued to demand that Ms Byrnes open the door and then said, “I am going down to the kids if you don’t”. Ms Byrnes then pointed towards the glass sliding door. The offender left through the sliding door.
	
	
	When Mr Whiteman could not enter because the front door was locked he went to the neighbour’s house to call the police.
	
	
	The offender was seen running from the scene and could not be located.
	
	
	On 11 March 2014 the offender was taken from Goulburn Correctional Centre to Goulburn Police Station and charged with 2 counts of intimidation.
	


Facts relating to the sentence proceedings


	
	At the date of the offence the victim, Francesco Carlino, was 86 years of age and required a walking stick to assist him with walking.
	
	
	A few days before the offence the offender travelled from Young to Sydney with Jennifer Lee Clarke (the co-offender) and a friend.
	
	
	At approximately 9.20am on 19 November 2014, the co-offender was sitting outside the Commonwealth Bank at Chester Hill having a conversation with the victim. At approximately 9.33am the bank opened. The victim entered the bank and withdrew $500 which he immediately put into his wallet before returning his wallet to his right back pocket. The offenders entered the bank separately and had separate interactions with bank staff.
	
	
	The victim walked out of the bank and spoke to the co-offender. A short discussion ensued before the victim and co-offender walked away together.
	
	
	The co-offender and the victim walked to Priam Street underground carpark. The offender also attended the carpark and hid behind a large concrete pole. Once the victim and the co-offender had reached the bottom of the carpark, they turned around and walked back.
	
	
	When the victim passed the concrete pole, the offender stepped out and swung his right arm out striking the victim on the right side of his face. The victim fell backwards to the ground. The co-offender initially walked away, before returning to the offender who was crouching beside the victim. The co-offender then searched the victim’s pockets while the offender stood next to the victim. The offender then stomped on the lower part of the victim’s face.
	
	
	The offender and co-offender rolled the victim back and forth a number of times. The offender then lifted the victim by the rear pocket of his pants before dropping him back onto the ground. The victim felt his wallet being removed from his back pocket, and his clothing being torn. The victim’s wallet contained $570, a medicare card, pension card, and a list of phone numbers.
	
	
	The offenders then left the victim and exited the carpark. Two people arrived shortly after and assisted the victim. The victim was treated by Ambulance officers at the scene before being transported to Liverpool Hospital. The victim suffered bruising to the right side of his mandible (jaw), swelling to the right side of his lips, 4mm laceration to the right upper lip inside his mouth, loosening of his lower left incisor tooth, a broken denture, as well as a graze to the left elbow.
	
	
	Following the offence, the offenders travelled to Bankstown by motor vehicle.
	
	
	At about 9.00pm the offender drove the same vehicle to Bankstown Police Station and 2 persons got in the vehicle. Police recognised the offender and activated their warning lights on the police vehicle. The offender accelerated harshly and failed to stop. A pursuit was initiated.
	
	
	The offender accelerated north on the Cairds Avenue, turning left into Carmen Avenue, right on Brancourt before turning onto the Hume Highway and travelling west. The offender drove through a red traffic light at the intersection of Cooper Road, where there were other motorists waiting at the intersection. On approaching the intersection of Highland Avenue, the offender was unable to proceed to because of traffic stopped at a red light. The offender then veered harshly from lane 3 to Lane 1 and mounted the kerb. The offender drove the vehicle down the southern footpath colliding with a number of chairs and tables outside of a restaurant. The vehicle continued along the footpath and onto Highland Avenue at speeds of approximately 50 to 60 km/h. The offender drove the vehicle onto The Crescent and continued to stop before a brick fence at 105 The Avenue, Yagoona. The offender ran from the scene and could not be located.
	
	
	On 20 November 2014 the offender was arrested on a train.
	


Video evidence


	
	The CCTV footage of the carpark was played in Court during the co-offender’s sentence proceedings. Whilst the agreed facts do present a clear picture of what occurred the CCTV footage is the best evidence of what occurred. From the footage I would make the following observations in addition to the agreed facts:
	



	
	the underground carpark was isolated;
	
	
	the co-offender appeared to be leading the victim;
	
	
	the offender took considerable steps to hide himself in the carpark prior to attacking the victim;
	
	
	the victim had considerable difficulty for an extended period of time in regaining his feet following the attack. He had to be assisted to do so by two people.
	


The offender’s evidence


	
	The offender relied on a report of Sam Borenstein, clinical psychologist dated 24 August 2016. That report can be summarised as follows.
	
	
	The psychologist interviewed the offender at the Metropolitan Remand and Receptions Centre on 24 August 2016 for the purpose of preparing the report.
	
	
	The offender told the psychologist that he was in the company of the co-offender, having to travelled to Sydney for the purpose of buying drugs. At the time of committing the offences he had not slept for 2 weeks and was consuming more than 3.5 g of ice per day.
	
	
	The offender told the psychologist that when he learned that the victim was in his 80s that he felt putrid and knew that what he had done was not right. The offender told the psychologist that the offences were committed about 8 weeks after his release from prison. He had been using ice whilst in custody and when was released he attempted to reconcile his six-year relationship.
	
	
	The offender gave a history of being in custody for approximately 18 years of his life, in both juvenile detention and adult prisons.
	
	
	The offender provided a significant psychiatric history. He was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder as a child and treated with medications including Ritalin. He consulted a psychiatrist roughly every month for about two years. He was diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia and possibly bipolar disorder. He was treated with antipsychotic medication but he could not tolerate side-effects.
	
	
	The offender has been trialled on a variety of medications and did not like the side-effects of any of them. The offender instead of medicated with a variety of drugs in particular methyl amphetamine over many years.
	
	
	He has consulted a psychiatrist in custody recently, but disagreed with the psychiatrist’s suggestion to try a new medication, saying that he did not want to be treated like a guinea pig.
	
	
	The offender has obtained benefit in the past from a medication known as Lyrica the past. Lyrica is a mood stabilising medication used to the treatment of bipolar disorder. It has been the offender’s experience in the past that when he stops taking prescribed medication that he commences illicit drug use.
	
	
	The offender has consulted a drug and alcohol counsellor and psychologist in the prison after his sister died of an overdose in February 2016. The offender has attempted suicide on a number of previous occasions.
	
	
	The offender told the psychologist that he relapsed into drug use as a result of his relationship faltering prior to Christmas 2013. The offender said at this time he was making a concerted effort to get his life back on track but that he was not equipped to deal with the emotional turmoil.
	
	
	The offender has been attracted to illicit drugs for the purpose of self-medication. They make him feel empowered and invincible and allow him to avoid feeling negative effects of his life.
	
	
	The offender told the psychologist that he was introduced to marijuana at age 12, amphetamines at age 13 and heroin at age 15. The offender was introduced to ice at age 21 when he was in prison and it became his preferred drug. The offender has also engaged in binge drinking and gambling from time to time.
	
	
	The offender told the psychologist that he understands he needs medication. The offender has not had benefit of impatient drug and alcohol treatment or inpatient psychiatric treatment. The offender reported previously experiencing hallucinations, hypersensitivity and paranoia. The offender is currently on protection as a result of being targeted by other prisoners.
	
	
	The offender was born in Harden and is an only child to his parents. His father left prior to his birth and he only met him at the age of 16. His mother entered a de facto relationship when the offender was about age 7. He has a number of half siblings. He was very close to his sister Donna who died in February 2016.
	
	
	The offender’s mother was heroin dependent and placed on methadone. She was later diagnosed with depression. The offender’s stepfather was drug dependent and violent towards the offender and his mother.
	
	
	The offender identifies as aboriginal.
	
	
	The offender attended about 10 different schools. He was regularly suspended and expelled. He was an average student. He can read and write. He was good at sport, particularly rugby league.
	
	
	The offender has little employment experience. He does not like being told what to do. He has completed a number of courses whilst in juvenile detention including building/construction, welding, carpentry, commercial cookery, hospitality and landscaping.
	
	
	The psychologist administered a number of tests. The results indicated that the offender was displaying symptoms of extremely severe depression, extremely severe anxiety and severe stress. He was unhappy and apprehensive, impulsive and compulsive. He has had anger management issues for as long as he can remember.
	
	
	The psychologist did not find any frank evidence of serious psychiatric disorder. The psychologist reported that he has a history of mental conditions including attention deficit disorder, oppositional defiant disorder and bipolar disorder. The psychologist noted that the offender has not been adequately treated for bipolar disorder and has resorted to self-medication. The psychologist believed that the benefit provided by Lyrica was supportive ofthe diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Psychologist recommended further treatment with appropriate medications and cognitive behavioural therapy to manage his mood swings. The psychologist opined if the offender’s bipolar disorder was properly treated would be less likely to resort to illicit drug use as a form of self-medication.
	


Pre-Sentence Report


	
	I will try not to repeat matters contained in the PSR that have already been mentioned.
	
	
	The offender has had 2 internal misconduct charges since has been in custody since 20 November 2014. They were both drug related. One of them occurred following the death of his sister.
	
	
	Prior to being taken into custody the offender had resided with his mother and step-father and 3 of his step-siblings in the Harden area. They are supportive. The offender reported having a close relationship with one of his step-sisters, who committed suicide in February 2016 when he was in custody.
	
	
	The offender had a violent childhood marred by domestic violence, alcohol and drug abuse as well as both physical and sexual abuse. During his childhood he was placed in the care of his grandmother and was first placed in juvenile detention at age 11. He has spent most of his life in custody.
	
	
	The offender was expelled from numerous schools in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. He completed Year 10 and has obtained a Certificate III in Commercial Cookery whilst in juvenile detention. His longest period of employment has been 6 months and he has performed odd jobs when he was most recently at liberty.
	
	
	The offender started using cannabis at age 13 and used heroin form 14 or 15 years of age. He ceased using heroin following an overdose. He commenced using drugs as a coping strategy to deal with mental health issues. He has had some benefit from drug and alcohol counselling in the past.
	
	
	The offender was using 5-6 grams of methylamphetamine and smoking a couple of cones of cannabis a day in November 2014. He had not slept for 11 or 12 days leading up to the commission of the robbery offence.
	
	
	The offender reported being non-compliant with his prescribed mental health medication. He has attempted suicide 5 times during his lifetime, the last attempt being before the commission of the robbery offences. The offender reported having been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bi-polar disorder, schizophrenia, depression and anxiety. He is not on any medication in custody and has refused the treatment from Justice Health. He has had treatment from a mental health practitioner in the community, but did not find that helpful.
	
	
	The offender told the author of the PSR that his actions were “putrid” and “wrong”. He was disgusted and ashamed of his actions and has tried not to think about their impact on the victim.
	
	
	The offender was assessed as a medium to high risk of reoffending. The offender will need support on his release from custody to engage with drug and alcohol rehabilitation, intervention targeting his violent tendencies and referral to mental health practitioners.
	
	
	I have also taken into account an undated letter from the offender to the Court.
	


Consideration

Breach of the section 9 bonds


	
	The Crown has invited me to take no action on the breach of the section 9 bonds, considering that they have expired and by reference to the other penalties that are to be imposed.
	
	
	I note that the imposition of the section 9 bonds by the magistrate was a penalty intended to assist the offender by avoiding further time in custody. Regrettably the offender did not take up that opportunity. I also note that the victim was vulnerable and the offences involved a significant violence. Those features are present in the sentence matter.
	
	
	I find that the section 9 bonds have been breached and I take no further action.
	


Breach of the section 12 bonds


	
	A determination of the breach of a suspended sentence is governed by sections 98(3) and 99 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	The Court must revoke a section 12 bond unless it is satisfied that the offender’s failure to comply was trivial or that there are good reasons for excusing the offender’s failure to comply. The subjective circumstances of the offender at the time of the breach proceedings are irrelevant to a determination of what will amount to “good reasons”.
	
	
	It was properly conceded on behalf of the offender that the bonds must be revoked.
	
	
	Section 99(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides that the Court may make an order that the sentence of imprisonment be served by home detention or an intensive corrections order. In Lambert v R [2015] NSWCCA 22 the Court of Criminal Appeal at [46], per Simpson J, decided that section 99(2) mandates the consideration by the Court of either home detention or an intensive corrections order as an available lesser punishment than full-time imprisonment, if appropriate.
	
	
	In the present case, neither of those options is appropriate.
	
	
	Section 99(4) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides that in resentencing an offender for the breach of the bond the Act must be applied. Sections 24(a) and 47(3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provide that I must take into account pre-sentence custody in relation to the offence. I calculate that to be 45 days. I will back date the sentences imposed to 7 October 2014 being 45 days before the offender was taken into custody on 20 November 2014.
	
	
	The good behaviour bonds are revoked.
	
	
	In relation to the offence of intimidating Mr Whiteman the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for 15 months, with a non-parole period of 10 months to date from 7 October 2014.
	
	
	In relation to the offence of intimidating Ms Byrnes the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for 15 months, with a non-parole period of 10 months to date from 7 October 2014.
	


Sentence proceedings

Objective seriousness of the offence


	
	The objective seriousness of the robbery offence is considerable. This offence was a cowardly and vicious attack on a defenceless, elderly and partially disabled man. The offenders worked in concert when they realised that he had withdrawn cash from the bank and was an easy target. The offender brutally struck the victim in the face from behind without warning bringing him to the ground. Both offenders then took part in an extensive violation of the victim’s person rifling through his clothing for the money they sought to take. The offender then viciously and dangerously stomped on the victim’s head before eventually taking his wallet by force. The co-offender stood by when the victim was savagely assaulted by the offender and assisted when it came time to take his wallet. The amount of money taken was relatively small. There was a limited degree of planning.
	
	
	The victim suffered a 4mm deep laceration to his upper lip, bruising to his jaw, swelling to his lips, a graze to the right elbow, a loose left lower incisor tooth and broken denture. I infer from the facts and am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offence would have been traumatic for the victim and resulted in ongoing psychological disturbance.
	
	
	The objective seriousness of the police pursuit offence is considerable. The police pursuit occurred at night and there were was a risk to a significant number of other road users. The extent of the reckless driving included disobeying the speed limit and traffic lights. The most disturbing aspect was the driving on the footpath where the vehicle collided with the tables and chairs set up in the alfresco dining area of the restaurant.
	


Deterrence


	
	General deterrence is of significance to the offences before the Court, One of the main purposes of punishment is to protect the public from the commission of crime by making it clear to the offender and other persons intending to commit similar crimes that they will meet with severe punishment.
	
	
	General deterrence may be attributed less weight in cases where the offender suffers from mental condition because such an offender is not an appropriate person to be made an example of: Muldrock v R (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [53]-[54]. The authorities do not mandate an entire disregard of general or specific deterrence by the sentencing judge: The extent of the reduction depends on the circumstances of the case: Palijan v R [2010] NSWCCA 142 at [27], R v Scognamiglio (1991) 56 A Crim R 81, R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 and R v Lawrence [2005] NSWCCA 91.
	
	
	The factors that are relevant to the assessment include the nature and extent of the mental condition suffered, whether the offender acted with knowledge of what they were doing and the gravity of their actions and whether the community require protection from the offender by reason of the mental condition suffered.
	
	
	The offender’s substance use, in particular his abuse of methylamphetamine that was the most direct cause of his offending behaviour. Addiction is not normally an excuse for committing offences, but considered to be a choice: R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. In this case, the offender was introduced to drugs at a young age and did not have the capacity to make an informed choice: R v Todorovic [2008] NSWCCA 49. I consider that his addiction was as a result of social disadvantage and arising from his mental condition. The offender is now 31 years of age and he has not managed to complete a course of rehabilitation. The offender now seems to accept that he needs to address his mental condition in order to stay away from illicit drug use.
	
	
	There is no evidence to suggest that the offender did not know what he was doing or did not realise the gravity of his actions. The footage of the incident and his manner of driving during the police pursuit indicate that he acted deliberately and there was no casual connection between his mental condition and the offending conduct.
	
	
	The offender’s substance abuse makes the offender a danger to society when he is at large. That danger is likely to continue unless he can achieve rehabilitation from substance abuse. This cannot lead to the imposition of a heavier sentence than would be appropriate if the offender was not suffering from a mental condition, but it is a material factor in determining the appropriate sentence.
	
	
	There is a need for specific deterrence in his case: R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 68. The offender has a history of offences of violence and the penalty imposed needs to convey the message that he must address his offending behaviour.
	


Aggravating factors


	
	The offender has a record of previous convictions: section 21A(2)(d) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offender has been convicted of a number of other offences involving violence. In at least 2 of those convictions the victim has been particularly vulnerable. The offender has received lengthy sentences of imprisonment for 2 of those convictions.
	
	
	Prior convictions are pertinent to deciding where, within the boundaries set by the objective circumstances are set, a sentence should lie: R v McNaughton (2006) 66 NSWLR 566 at [26]. It cannot be said in the present case that the offences before the Court were isolated. Rather it appears that the offender has a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law, which I accept has been as a result of his drug use. Prior convictions should not be taken into account in such a way to punish the offender again for those earlier matters, but in this case they do not assist the offender in affording to him any particular leniency.
	
	
	The offences were committed whilst the offender was on conditional liberty: section 21A(2)(j) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. At the time of the commission of the offences the offender was on six good behaviour bonds, including 2 suspended sentences that I have already dealt with. I have taken the breach of the section 9 bonds into account as an aggravating factor on the sentence matters.
	
	
	The victim was vulnerable by reason of his age and physical incapacity section 21A(2)(l) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. At the date of the offence the victim was 86 years old and required a walking stick to assist him with walking. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this aggravating factor is established and consider it to be a significant consideration in the sentencing exercise.
	
	
	The offence was committed for financial gain: section 21A(2)(o) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	


Mitigating factors.


	
	The offender has demonstrated remorse: section 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offender has expressed remorse to the psychologist, the author of the PSR and to the court. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender has expressed genuine contirion and remorse.
	
	
	The offender entered a plea of guilty in the Local Court: sections 21A(3)(k) and 22 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offender is entitled to a discount on penalty that reflects the utilitarian value of that plea. The extent of the discount should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25%, but that is only a guide. The primary consideration in determining where in the range a particular case should fall, is the timing of the plea so that the earlier the plea the greater the discount: R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 and R v Borkowski (2009) 195 A Crim R 1 at [32]. The plea also indicates remorse: Borkowski at [32]. The appropriate discount is 25%.
	


Totality


	
	The offender has been in custody almost continually since 2002. I have had regard the principle of totality in setting the appropriate terms of imprisonment and in partially accumulating the terms of imprisonment to be imposed.
	


Parity


	
	There is no rule of law which requires co-offenders to be given the same sentence for the same offence even if no distinction can be drawn between them. Disparity may be justified by differences between co-offenders such as age, background, criminal history, general character and the part each has played in the relevant criminal conduct or enterprise, Green v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 462 at at [31]-[32].
	
	
	In this case, the differences between the criminal records of the offenders and the fact that the violence was deployed by the offender, justify the imposition of different sentences for the robbery offence.
	


Other matters


	
	I have considered the principles outlined in R v Fernando (1992) 65 A Crim R 98. I am satisfied that the offender had a dysfunctional upbringing and a home life in which he was exposed to the abuse of alcohol and drugs as well as domestic violence and sexual abuse. The offender had a limited opportunity to participate in education. He has had little opportunity to participate in paid employment and has resorted to drugs to alleviate the symptoms of his mental condition.. The offender’s deprived background is a matter that should be considered as a matter that mitigates the sentence imposed: Bugmy v R (2013) 249 CLR 571.
	
	
	I have had regard to the guideline judgment in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. In my view this matter is more serious than the offence of the character identified in Henry, because of the extent of the violence used, the extent of the offender’s record for offences of violence, the extent of the vulnerability of the victim and the fact that the offender was on conditional liberty.
	


Sentencing statistics and comparative cases


	
	The offender tendered sentencing statistics for the substantive offence when dealt with in the local and by the higher courts. I have considered the pattern of sentencing disclosed by those matters and have noted the limitations on their use set out in the cases such as Hili v The Queen (2010) 242 CLR 520 and Barbaro v The Queen (2014) 253 CLR 58.
	
	
	I have also been referred to and considered a number of comparable cases, set out in the written submissions of the offender.
	


No alternative to imprisonment


	
	I have considered section 5 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and I am satisfied that having considered all possible alternatives that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate.
	


Sentence


	
	The appropriate penalty for the police pursuit offence is 2 years imprisonment. The appropriate penalty for the robbery offence is 7 years and 6 months imprisonment. Both of those terms will be discounted by 25% to take into account the pleas of guilty.
	
	
	I find that there are special circumstances. The offender has spent most of his life in custody. He requires an extended period of supervision upon his release from custody to assist him to reintegrate into the community, to get vocational training and to deal with his addiction and mental health issues. The offender has recently accepted that he requires medication and treatment for his mental condition and there is some hope for his rehabilitation.
	
	
	In relation to the police pursuit offence the offender is convicted. I impose a sentence of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 12 months to date from 7 April 2015 and a head sentence of 18 months.
	
	
	In relation to the robbery offence the offender is convicted. I impose a sentence of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months years to date from 7 January 2016 and a head sentence of 5 years and 9 months.
	
	
	Taking into account the terms of imprisonment imposed for the suspended sentences, the total effective sentence I have imposed for all matters is 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months to date from 7 October 2014. The offender will be eligible to be released on parole on 6 April 2019.

		20 September 2016",2016-09-14 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2240581,Prothonotary of the Supreme Court of New South Wales v Mallegowda [2016] NSWSC 1087,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	On 5 June 2014 the Prothonotary commenced proceedings by summons against the contemnor seeking a declaration that he was guilty of contempt of court and consequential orders. Following various interlocutory applications and directions the hearing of the summons commenced on 30 June 2015. The plaintiff called three witnesses – Mr Ashwin Gowda, Mr Dhanraj Malpe Shridhar and Mr Naveen Lingaiah – who were cross-examined, in substance it being put to them that their evidence of the contumelious conduct was untrue – as well as Mr Samuel Roberts, a solicitor. The trial was then adjourned to 25 August 2015. The plaintiff called another witness, who was cross-examined, again it being put to him that in certain respects he was not telling the truth. The contemnor gave evidence and called one witness. On 27 August 2015 the contemnor’s counsel obtained an adjournment to make enquiries regarding the accuracy of certain records which had been produced under subpoena during the hearing. When the hearing resumed on 18 November 2015 the contemnor pleaded guilty to the charge, which was in the following terms –
	


“For that [the contemnor] is guilty of contempt of Court in that on 26 August 2013, he, being a party to defamation proceedings, did threaten a witness by making the following two telephone calls, (a) to Mr Ashwin Vishweshwaria, a witness in those proceedings, during which he said words to the effect, ‘how dare you testify against me, you think you're very smart, I have the details, all the details, of you helping university students in exchange for money, and I'll get you caught for plagiarism. I have all the records of your bank account and tax, and I'm going to report you to the university tax department and the immigration department’, and (b) to Mr Dhanraj Shridhar, who was a friend of Mr Vishweshwaria, during which he said words to the effect ‘tell Ashwin that if he doesn’t withdraw his affidavit by midday tomorrow, I will make complaints to the ATO and immigration departments about him’; which conduct had a tendency to interfere with the administration of justice.”

The circumstances of the contempt


	
	The circumstances are summarised in the submissions of the Crown Advocate, who conducted the proceeding on behalf of the Prothonotary. No significant issue was taken with them and they provide the basis for much of the following account.
	
	
	In November 2012 the contemnor commenced defamation proceedings against Mr Amit Sood and Mr Lingaiah in the District Court of New South Wales concerning emails sent by them to members of the Indian Association of Newcastle several weeks before. Mr Sood cross-claimed against the contemnor in relation to an earlier email allegedly sent by him to the Association. The contemnor denied sending this earlier email and this became an important issue in the proceedings. Mr Sood obtained an expert’s opinion to the effect that the earlier email was sent from a Gmail account created on a computer which was assigned to the contemnor at his workplace with NSW Roads and Maritime Services (RMS). An affidavit of Mr Gowda had been provided to the expert and was attached to his report, which had been served on the contemnor’s solicitors. In that affidavit Mr Gowda said that the contemnor had contacted him on his mobile phone on 23 August 2012 and asked him how to delete a Gmail account. He said that he was driving at the time, so he called him back about an hour later but the contemnor told him that he had already worked out how to delete it.
	
	
	On 26 August 2013 a mediation of the defamation proceedings took place. Present at the mediation were the contemnor, his legal advisors, Mr Lingaiah, Mr Sood and Mr Roberts, their solicitor. It is evident from an affidavit of Mr Roberts filed in the present proceedings (following the contemnor’s plea of guilty) that he became aware of the contents of Mr Gowda’s affidavit during the mediation. The mediation concluded at 12.30pm and, shortly after, the contemnor made two telephone calls. The first was made to Mr Gowda at about 1.07pm in which he said words to the effect –
	


“How dare you testify against me? You think you are very smart. I have all the details of you helping university students in exchange for money and I will get you caught for plagiarism. I have all the records of your bank account and tax and I am going to report you to university, tax department and the immigration department.”

At the time of this call Mr Gowda was travelling from Sydney to Newcastle. In the car with him was Mr Lingaiah, Mr Sood and Mr Roberts who were immediately told about the contemnor’s threat. About half an hour later, the contemnor telephoned Mr Shridhar who was a friend of Mr Gowda’s and said to him –

“Tell Ashwin that if he doesn’t withdraw his affidavit by midday tomorrow I will make complaints to ATO and immigration department about him.”


	
	There can be no doubt that this conduct of the contemnor in making these threats had a real tendency to interfere with the administration of justice and constituted a contempt of court. That this was so was necessarily admitted by the contemnor by his plea of guilty.
	


Maximum penalty


	
	(The legal principles, which are not controversial, have also been usefully and fairly summarised in the Crown Advocate’s written submissions, from which the following is largely drawn). The penalty for the common law offence of contempt of court is at large: R v Smith (1991) 25 NSWLR 1 at 13. Part 55 Rule 13 of the Supreme Court Rules 1970 provides –
	


13 Punishment

(1) Where the contemnor is not a corporation, the Court may punish contempt by committal to a correctional centre or fine or both.

(2) Where the contemnor is a corporation, the Court may punish contempt by sequestration or fine or both.

(3) The Court may make an order for punishment on terms, including a suspension of punishment or a suspension of punishment in case the contemnor gives security in such manner and in such sum as the Court may approve for good behaviour and performs the terms of the security.


	
	The circumstances of the contempt here are similar to those which would otherwise fall within ss 322 and 323 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Section 322 relevantly provides that a person who threatens to do or cause any injury or detriment to any person intending to influence a person to withhold true evidence or to not attend as a witness is liable to imprisonment for 10 years whilst s 323 relevantly provides that a person who does any act intending to cause any person called as a witness in any judicial proceeding to withhold true evidence or not to attend as a witness is liable to imprisonment for 7 years. The threat made by the contemnor to Mr Gowda to my mind is of the kind to which both of these sections apply: there was a clear threat to cause detriment to Mr Gowda, with potentially catastrophic consequences for him and, in effect, it was designed to punish him for having provided the affidavit and induce him not to give evidence of that kind in the defamation proceedings which were then pending. It has been said, in connection with an offence under s 323, that “the conduct strikes at the integrity of the system of justice and some form of custodial sentence is normally appropriate”: Warby v The Queen (2007) 171 A Crim R 575; [2007] NSWCCA 173 at [25]; R v Burton [2008] NSWCCA 128.
	
	
	The principles pertaining to sentencing for common law offences where there is an analogous statutory offence were set out by Campbell J (with whom Macfarlan JA and Barr AJ agreed) in Blackstock v R [2013] NSWCCA 172 as follows –
	


“[8] Misconduct in public office is a common law offence in respect of which the penalty is at large, that is to say, no maximum penalty is fixed by law. In respect of such matters it is the practice of the Court to adopt an analogous or corresponding statutory offence, where one is available, as a reference point for the imposition of penalty: R. v. Hokin, Burton and Peisley (1922) 22 SR (NSW) 280 at 291 - 2 per the Court.

[9] In Jaturawong v. Regina [2011] NSWCCA 168 Beazley JA (as her Honour then was) (Hall and Harrison JJ agreeing) adopted the offences created by Part 4A Crimes Act relating to corruptly receiving commissions and other corrupt practices as the appropriate reference point for this common law offence. The offences created by the provisions of that part each impose a maximum penalty of imprisonment for seven years.

[10] I do not understand R. v. Hokin to establish a rule that the sentence imposed for the common law offence cannot, as a matter of law, exceed the maximum imposed for the statutory analogue ...”


	
	In R v Abdallah; In the matter of John Leger [2014] NSWSC 320 at [29] Campbell J observed that these principles apply also in the context of sentencing for a common law contempt –
	


“[29] I should say at this point that the offence of contempt in the face of the court is a common law offence and as such it is said that the penalty is at large. In dealing with such offences courts will often have regard to any available, or near, statutory analogue which might provide a reference point for determining the maximum penalty appropriate to what might be called a worst possible case of the common law offence. I am not suggesting that this is the worst possible case of contempt in the face of the court.”


	
	I agree with the Crown Advocate that the maximum penalties provided by ss 322 and 323 are relevant reference points for the purpose of sentencing the contemnor in the present case. In my view, of the two sections, s 322 is the more relevant provision.
	


Plea of guilty


	
	The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) applies to sentencing the contemnor. Section 22 of that Act requires the Court to take into account a plea of guilty and permits a lesser sentence to be imposed where such a plea is made. As the chronology shows, the contemnor changed his plea to guilty on 17 November 2015.
	
	
	The effect of s 22 has frequently been discussed in judgments of this Court but, for present purposes, it is sufficient to return to the decision which preceded the enactment of s 22 but in which the appropriate principles were stated by Spigelman CJ (the other members of the Court agreeing): R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383; 115 A Crim R 104. In stating that the utilitarian value of a plea to the criminal justice system should generally be assessed in the range of a 10 to 25 per cent discount on sentence, the Chief Justice pointed out that the “primary consideration determining where in the range a particular case should fall, is the timing of the plea” noting that “[i]n some cases a plea will not lead to any discount”. In this case, the Crown Advocate submits that the plea was entered at the conclusion of the evidence both for the prosecution and the defence, so that it had negligible utilitarian value and no discount should be applied. However, it is not quite accurate to say that the plea was entered at the conclusion of the evidence. On 27 August 2015, the last of the trial hearing dates, the Crown Advocate indicated that it intended to call Mr Roberts in the plaintiff’s case in reply and might well also need to call Mr Rasmussan, who was his counsel at the mediation proceedings. The plea on the adjourned date obviated the necessity to call Mr Roberts and Mr Rasmussan. Furthermore, it also obviated the need for submissions on the question of guilt, which must certainly have taken a day or so. Accordingly, there was some, though not much, utilitarian value in the contemnor’s change of plea to guilty. I propose to apply a discount of 10 per cent to his sentence.
	


Criminal record


	
	The contemnor has never been convicted of a criminal offence either in Australia or elsewhere.
	


Remorse


	
	Section 21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requires remorse shown by an offender to be taken into account as a mitigating factor but only if there is evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions and has acknowledged any injury caused by those actions or made reparation for any such injury. A pre-sentence report was tendered in which the officer stated that the contemnor had “acknowledged his wrongdoing and admitted that he acted inappropriately at the time of committing the offence”. The Crown Advocate however, submits that his conduct throughout the history of the proceedings, particularly in the conduct of the trial itself, was inconsistent with genuine remorse. The most significant is the conduct of the proceedings themselves. As the Crown Advocate pointed out, the contemnor had not merely put the prosecution to proof – from which no adverse conclusion could be drawn – but his evidence, going much further than mere denials, comprised a sustained attack on the credit and character of Mr Gowda, Mr Shridhar and Mr Lingaiah, all of whom had been cross-examined to suggest that they had, for various personal reasons, given false evidence. Furthermore the contemnor’s evidence involved fabrication of supporting details.
	
	
	The contemnor also gave evidence in the proceedings on sentence. When he was first asked what his attitude was about the commission of the offence, he said –
	


“A. I did plead guilty. I did wrong. I did regret and I should not have done this and I’ll never do it again. And I apologise to the honourable Court and the Honourable Judge and I ended up as guilty for contempt of Court and I take in that’s the responsibility of me and I will never do it again.”


	
	He was asked whether he accepted that he threatened Ashwin Gowda that if he did not withdraw his affidavit he would report him to immigration and the ATO. He said that he mostly accepted this. He explained –
	


“I said words to the effect of, I’ve made complaints to the organisation. Those were the words that were said. And I never used the word… [not transcribable] withdraw an affidavit.

Q. Sorry, I never used the word?

A. What is said in the affidavit that I told him to withdraw an affidavit. Those words were not said but the remaining of whatever was in his affidavit, I’ll agree with that.”

The contemnor said that he commenced his telephone conversation by talking about the family and how he was and added –

“Then I came to ask him questions about confronting him giving an affidavit and why he’s giving it. And then I said “I can report you doing some fraudulent things to the authorities of the government”. Those were the words were said, but I never said about withdrawing an affidavit.

Q. Sorry you said what to him?

A. I said words to the effect that I have known your contact as well, and I can also complain to Australian Immigration Department, Australian Taxation Office and Newcastle University. These words were literally a threatening message but said in this way.

Q. Mr Mallegowda, in any event, you agree do you not that the purpose of the conversation was to threaten Mr Gowda not to give evidence in the defamation proceedings?

A. As I understand now, those words are definitely a threat.

Q. No, not what you understood now, that’s what you intended at the time to convey to him?

A. Yes.”


	
	He later explained that he denied the charge “because the affidavits which were tendered were not entirely true. As I said, I never spoke the words to the effect ‘withdraw an affidavit’”. However, he conceded that, whatever words were used, he intended them to have the effect of frightening Mr Gowda into withdrawing his affidavit, and that he “knew all the time that his affidavit was the truth”, that he could have pleaded guilty, that he was aware that subpoenas were issued by his solicitor with the intention of attacking the credit of Mr Gowda and Mr Shridhar because his case, essentially, was that they had lied. He was then asked –
	


“Q. In substance you knew that their accounts of the conversations with you were truthful. In other words, you had indeed threatened them.

A. That’s a yes your Honour. Overall I admit that it was threatening, but the --

Q. Sorry

A. Overall, I admit the conversation was a kind of a threat.

Q. What do you mean ‘a kind of a threat’ sorry?

A. It was a threat your Honour.”


	
	The distinction that the contemnor seemed to have been attempting to make was between, on the one hand, making a threat with the intention that Mr Gowda should withdraw his affidavit and, on the other, of actually telling him to withdraw his affidavit. Having regard to the terms in which he was charged and his plea of guilty, I consider this qualification to be an attempt to withdraw, albeit slightly, from a frank admission of what he intended to do. The manner in which the contemnor gave this evidence did not impress as candid.
	
	
	The Crown Advocate submitted that I should conclude that the contemnor was remorseful only in the sense that he regretted what he had done because of the consequences for him rather than any heartfelt acceptance that what he had done was not only unlawful but wrong. The Crown Advocate pointed to the repeated lies which he had given in evidence which, as she rightly submitted, constituted a sustained attack on the credit and character of the witnesses called by the Prothonotary. In short, he became remorseful only when it became clear that he could prevaricate no longer and the offence was bound to be proved. In this respect, I should refer to the statements made by the applicant’s wife and tendered on his behalf that the contemnor “regrets and feels guilty for contacting a witness who was giving evidence in the Court for the opponents” and from other friends who have, in various ways, stated that he feels very sorry and regrets his conduct. But these expressions again suggest to my mind that his regret is rather for the consequences of his conduct than its character. Thus, Mr Nagender Singh said, “Shashi feels very sorry and regrets for his conduct which has landed him in this difficult situation”, whilst Mr Pavan Reddy says, “Shashi now severely regrets for his actions and feels huge shame to him and his family. Shashi told me that at the time of the incident, he did not realise that he will be end-up in this situation and did not think about the consequences. He told me that he is extremely remorseful for what he has done. He also told me he is suffering from feelings of shame and humiliation day in and day out. He is disappointed and ashamed of himself”. On the other hand, he told Mr Mark Foran that “he now knows that the contact with [the potential witness] was the wrong thing to do … [and] he displays true regret and is remorseful for his actions.” Others of his friends make the same point in somewhat different ways.
	
	
	I accept that the contemnor, at the time of the critical telephone conversations, may not have been aware that he was breaking the law but it must have been apparent to him from the moment he was charged with the offence of contempt that, indeed, he had broken the law. His attempt by deceit to avoid the consequences of so doing, which involved not only his giving perjured evidence but also alleging that the plaintiff’s witnesses were lying, demonstrates that, at least up to that stage, he was not remorseful for what he had done, although he might have been worried about the punishment to which he may have exposed himself. It does not appear that any of the persons who gave testimonials on his behalf as to his remorse were aware of the way in which he conducted his defence. I think it is obvious that the contemnor only pleaded guilty when it became obvious to him that the prosecution was able to prove that he had indeed, contrary to his denials, become aware of Mr Gowda’s affidavit. In the result, the most I think that can be said for the contemnor is that he now realises that what he did was seriously unlawful and warrants punishment and that he regrets that he put himself in this position. Since this is, in part, the purpose of proceedings of this kind, to that extent it may be accepted that the prosecution has served the necessary function. However, I would not be prepared to conclude that the contemnor has accepted that he committed a morally culpable offence.
	


Mental health


	
	On 3 February 2011 the contemnor was evaluated by Dr Christopher Bench, a psychiatrist, for the purpose of considering whether he met the criteria specified in s 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW) in respect of certain conduct. It is not necessary for present purposes to detail the history taken by the doctor. He concluded that the contemnor suffered from the severe form of Bipolar Disorder, namely Bipolar I Disorder with characteristic depressive and manic episodes including, on occasions, psychotic symptoms. During a manic state he exhibits agitation and aggression, requiring treatment in an institutional environment, intra-muscular medication and seclusion. He qualified to be dealt with under s 32 of the Act. Dr Bench recommended a treatment plan.
	
	
	The contemnor’s treating psychiatrist, Dr Cyriac Matthew confirmed the diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder and noted that he had been stable on the medications prescribed for him but becomes unwell when facing significant stress or even minor alterations in the medications. He stressed that he had a tendency to get very unwell and psychotic within a few hours and it was often difficult to predict these relapses. It is likely that he will need treatment for many years, probably lifelong. Dr Matthew thought that he had a relapse of mania with psychosis in the context of dealing in 2015 with the present proceedings and was at a significant risk of another relapse. However, it appears that since, at least, the commencement of the hearing, such a relapse has not occurred.
	
	
	For the purpose of the present proceedings Dr Olav Nielssen prepared a psychiatric report in which he diagnosed Bipolar Mood Disorder (Manic Depressive Illness) which was in remission when he saw him on 2 November 2015, Dr Nielssen, who had been given the details of the contempt charges contained in the summons concluded –
	


“There would appear to be direct link between his mental state and the offences, as the documents confirm that at the time he was recovering from a manic episode triggered by [a] recent trip to India, and his behaviour is consistent with being in a manic state, when compared to his normal behaviour and demeanour”.


	
	The Crown Advocate does not take issue with the conclusion that the contemnor’s mental health may have been compromised at the time of the offences but points out that Dr Nielssen noted that there is “complete remission between episodes of mania” and no evidence of any such episodes since 2013. The Crown Advocate submitted that the manner in which the contemnor gave his evidence and conducted the proceedings, when he was in complete remission, demonstrated a complete disrespect for the administration of justice. She submitted that his conduct in the courtroom is so similar to that which underpinned the contempt with which he had been charged it would be open to the Court to find that any causal connection between his mental health and his conduct in committing the contempt was minimal at best.
	
	
	I accept, more probably than not, that the acts of contempt were impulsive and to some degree caused by his mental state. On the other hand, the evidence that he gave in Court must have been carefully considered over a lengthy period of time and was, I thought, careful and calculating. However, although that demonstrated that he had not accepted either that he had committed any wrongdoing or, at all events, would try (even by lying to the Court and making false allegations of dishonesty against prosecution witnesses) to avoid the legal consequences of what he had done, this did not mean that his acts at the time were any less impulsive or contributed to by his mental disorder. He is being punished for his contempt and not for his conduct of the trial, however reprehensible that was. On balance, I am prepared to act upon the basis that the contemnor’s mental condition, to some extent, contributed to the impulsivity of his behaviour, although I would not go so far as to find that, if he had been in remission at the time, he would have been unlikely to have committed the offence.
	
	
	As the Crown Advocate rightly points out, an offender’s mental condition can have the effect of reducing a person’s moral culpability so that general deterrence, retribution and denunciation should have less significance in sentencing the offender but, even where there is a causal relationship between an offender’s mental condition and the offence, a reduced sentence does not necessarily result: Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 71 per Gleeson CJ. However, as it seems to me, the qualification mentioned by the Chief Justice is not significant in the present case. In my view, the contemnor’s mental illness should also be taken into account for the purpose of considering whether, were he to be sentenced to a term actually to be served in prison, his incarceration would be more onerous for him than the ordinary run of prisoner. Given the stressful conditions which necessarily result from incarceration, I think this is a significant factor in his case.
	
	
	I note that s 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act does not apply to a contempt prosecution in this Court: Prothonotary of the Supreme Court of New South Wales v Chan (No 15) [2015] NSWSC 1177.
	


Character evidence


	
	As I have mentioned a number of testimonials to the contemnor’s good character which have been tendered without objection. I do not intend to deal with these in detail. Their general purport is that he is a loving and caring husband and father of two young children, aged 11 years and 8 years. He has been regularly employed and maintains his family. He has for many years organised charity work, such as blood donation camps, including organising in 2014 a group of people to make blood donations to the Australian Red Cross and raising other funds for various charities. For the last four years he has been organising an annual festival in Newcastle to promote Indian culture in the community, with all proceeds donated to a religious charity. I am prepared to accept that, aside from this particular offence, the contemnor has been of good character. He has contributed in significant ways not only to his family but also to the community of which he is a part. I accept that the present proceedings and his admission of guilt, which must be well known in the community of which he has been a prominent member, has caused considerable shame and humiliation.
	


Determination


	
	The objective seriousness of the offence committed by the contemnor is significant. The administration of justice depends upon witnesses being prepared to come forward and tell the truth about the facts in their knowledge that are relevant to the matter before the courts. Any conduct which interferes or is intended to interfere with this process, whether preventing a witness from either providing or giving evidence or persuading him or her to stray from the truth must be regarded as a grave interference with the course of justice and calls for significant punishment, not only to denounce the conduct and punish the wrongdoing but to deter others who might think that it is either acceptable or trivial to act in this way. Giving the benefit to the contemnor of the mitigating circumstances to which I have referred above, it seems to me that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate to vindicate the necessity to protect the administration of justice from conduct such as that he committed.
	
	
	Taking all of the objective and subjective circumstances into account it is my view that a sentence of 9 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 months should be imposed. The question then arises as to how this sentence should be served, that is by way of a suspended sentence, home detention, intensive correction order or full time custody. I have had the benefit of assessment reports as to the suitability of the contemnor for a disposition otherwise than requiring actual imprisonment. I am satisfied that the appropriate order is that the sentence be suspended. Therefore, pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) I order that the execution of that sentence be suspended for 9 months and direct that the contemnor be released on condition that he enters into a bond to be of good behaviour for a term of 9 months.

		10 August 2016",2016-08-08 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2240869,Trinh v R [2016] NSWCCA 110,"Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA:   On 23 December 2015 the applicant, Mr Trinh, filed a “release application”, seeking release on bail, following his arrest on 22 July 2015 and charging with numerous serious indictable offences involving computer fraud. On 29 July 2015 he was before the Burwood Local Court and applied for release on bail. The application was refused.
	
	
	On a date which is not apparent from the material before this Court, a release application was lodged with the Supreme Court. The application was heard by Schmidt J on 6 November 2015 and was refused, the judgment being delivered on 9 November 2015. On 23 December 2015 the applicant lodged the release application presently before this Court.
	
	
	The application for release on bail must be dealt with pursuant to the Bail Act 2013 (NSW). Any general law power to grant bail was abolished by its predecessor, the Bail Act 1978 (NSW), s 14 and s 62. The repeal of that Act did not revive any general power to grant bail. [1] 
	
	
	Bail having been sought and refused by the Local Court and by a judge of the Supreme Court, it is necessary to consider first the nature of the powers conferred on this Court.
	


Jurisdiction and powers of Court of Criminal Appeal


	
	The powers to hear bail applications are conferred under Pt 6 of the Bail Act. Part 6 contains four divisions, namely “Interpretation” (Div 1), “General powers” (Div 2), “Additional powers” (Div 3) and “Restrictions on powers” (Div 4). It is convenient to deal first with the provisions in Divs 1, 2 and 4. The general power to hear a bail application is conferred upon the court in which the substantive proceedings for the offence, which does not include proceedings on an application for bail, is to be heard. [2]  There is also a general power to hear a bail application if the court has convicted the person and if there is an appeal against conviction or sentence in another court, but the person has not yet made a first appearance before the appellate court. None of these provisions confers power on this Court in this case, the applicant being on remand awaiting trial. The powers of this Court therefore depend upon the provisions of Div 3, “Additional powers”. The scheme of that Division is, subject to specific exceptions, to create jurisdiction on an hierarchical basis.
	
	
	Variation decisions are dealt with separately from release decisions (seeking a grant of bail) and detention decisions (seeking a return of an accused person to custody) and may be put to one side. (Variation decisions involve applications to vary the terms on which bail has been granted.)
	
	
	A Local Court may hear a bail application if a bail decision has already been made by an authorised justice or police officer. [3]  The District Court has very limited additional powers, that is powers in relation to persons other than those who have proceedings for the offence pending in the District Court. [4] 
	
	
	The powers specific to the Supreme Court are dealt with separately as to release applications and detention applications. Relevantly for present purposes, the Supreme Court may hear a release application if bail has been refused by another court, an authorised justice or a police officer. In the present case, the jurisdiction exercised by Schmidt J arose because the applicant had been refused bail in the Burwood Local Court.
	
	
	Before turning to the powers of this Court, it is convenient to note the prohibition on multiple applications for release or detention applications. Both kinds of application are dealt with in s 74, which with respect to release applications reads as follows:
	


74   Multiple release or detention applications to same court not permitted

(1)   A court that refuses bail for an offence, or that affirms a decision to refuse bail for an offence, after hearing a release application is to refuse to hear another release application made by the accused person for the same offence, unless there are grounds for a further release application.

…

(3)   For the purposes of this section, the grounds for a further release application are:

(a)   the person was not legally represented when the previous application was dealt with and the person now has legal representation, or

(b)   material information relevant to the grant of bail is to be presented in the application that was not presented to the court in the previous application, or

(c)   circumstances relevant to the grant of bail have changed since the previous application was made, or

(d)   the person is a child and the previous application was made on a first appearance for the offence.


	
	It follows that, subject to s 74(3), no further application for release could be made by the applicant to a single judge in the Common Law Division. For that reason, he has invoked the powers of this Court which are set out in s 67.
	


67   Powers specific to Court of Criminal Appeal

(1)   The Court of Criminal Appeal may hear a bail application for an offence if:

(a)   the Court has ordered a new trial and the new trial has not commenced, or

(b)   the Court has made an order under section 8A(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 and the person is before the Court, or

(c)   the Court has directed a stay of execution of a conviction and the stay is in force, or

(d)   an appeal from the Court is pending in the High Court, or

(e)   a bail decision has been made by the Land and Environment Court, the Industrial Court or the Supreme Court.

(2)   Despite subsection (1)(e), a Judge of the Court of Criminal Appeal sitting alone cannot hear a bail application if a bail decision has been made by the Supreme Court (however constituted) unless the rules made under the Supreme Court Act 1970 permit the Judge to do so.


	
	The reason for conferring jurisdiction on this Court in relation to paragraphs (a)-(d) of subs 67(1) is understandable. The present case, however, falls only within par (e), satisfying that condition because “a bail decision has been made by … the Supreme Court.” Accordingly, a condition to invoke the powers of this Court has been satisfied. Three questions then arise: namely, (a) the nature of the hearing which this Court is empowered to conduct, (b) whether a court, in the exercise of the additional powers which state that it “may hear” a bail application for an offence, may also decline to hear the application and (c) if there is a discretion to decline to hear the application, on what grounds it may be exercised. These questions are closely related.
	


Power to decline to hear application


	
	The first issue of construction is whether s 67 (no doubt in common with other sections in Div 3 conferring additional powers) conferred a power coupled with an implied duty to exercise the power, once properly engaged. The Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW), s 9(1) states that “the word ‘may’, if used to confer a power, indicates that the power may be exercised or not, at discretion.” However, that meaning may give way to an inconsistent textual or contextual indication. [5]  Some support for the existence of an implied duty may be derived from s 75 which reads as follows:
	


75   Fresh application to be dealt with as new hearing

Any bail application heard by a court or authorised justice is to be dealt with as a new hearing, and evidence or information may be given in addition to, or in substitution for, the evidence or information given in relation to an earlier bail decision. (Emphasis added.)


	
	This question does not seem to have received reasoned consideration in this Court. On one view, that is curious, as ss 67 and 75 (unlike some other provisions in the Bail Act) have been unamended since the commencement of the Act on 1 December 2013. On the other hand, so far, there appear to have been relatively few applications to this Court for bail following refusal by a judge of the Supreme Court. (The number of cases which might come via the Land and Environment Court or the Industrial Court would be insignificant.) Beech-Jones J expressed disquiet in Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Mawad [6]  that the Bail Act requires that this Court “must conduct a fresh review even though the question of bail will ordinarily have already been considered by at least two levels of the judicial system.” However, Beech-Jones J did not consider what precisely was required by s 75, an issue to which it will be necessary to return shortly.
	
	
	Whether it is correct to say that the Court “must conduct” a hearing raises squarely the issue of statutory construction. Section 75 should be considered in its statutory context; it appears in Pt 7 of the Bail Act, which covers ss 71-76.
	
	
	Section 72 uses language which is in contrast to that used in the sections conferring powers on the courts. It expressly imposes an obligation to hear a bail application, where it operates:
	


72   Application by accused person must be heard on first appearance

(1)   A court or authorised justice must hear any release application or variation application made by an accused person on a first appearance in substantive proceedings for an offence.

(2)   The court or authorised justice is not to decline to hear the application because notice of the application has not been given to the prosecutor in the proceedings, but may adjourn the hearing, to enable notice to be given, if the court or authorised justice considers it necessary in the interests of justice.


	
	Section 72(1) does not, of course, apply in the present case: the applicant does not appear before this Court in the substantive proceedings for an offence, let alone by way of a first appearance in such proceedings.
	
	
	Section 73 provides discretionary grounds to refuse to hear a bail application in proceedings other than those referred to in s 72.
	


73   Discretionary grounds to refuse to hear bail application

(1)   A court may refuse to hear a bail application if satisfied that:

(a)   the application is frivolous or vexatious, or

(b)   the application is without substance or otherwise has no reasonable prospect of success.

(2)   A court (other than the Local Court) may refuse to hear a bail application if satisfied that the application could be dealt with as a variation application by the Local Court or an authorised justice.

(3)   This section does not apply to a release application or a variation application made by an accused person on a first appearance in substantive proceedings for the offence.


	
	It is clear, therefore, that s 67 does not confer a power coupled with a duty in unqualified terms. One question, raised by s 73, is whether that provision purports to be an exclusive identification of the circumstances in which the court may refuse to hear an application. Although that is a possible construction, there are three reasons to think that it may not be the appropriate construction in the context. First, the grounds themselves involve evaluative concepts and are not defined with precision. Secondly, because of the limited circumstances in which a second or further application can be made, following a refusal of a release application, there may be a benefit to the accused person in allowing the court a reasonably broad power to decline to hear an application. Thirdly, both a police officer (pursuant to s 44) and a court (pursuant to s 56) may “defer” making a bail decision if the accused person is intoxicated. These provisions also provide grounds for thinking that a discretionary power to decline to hear an application should not be narrowly defined.
	
	
	Turning to s 67, other considerations are relevant. These include the right of an accused person to make a further release application in the circumstances identified in s 74(3). This being essentially an appellate court, without any other freestanding original jurisdiction, it may be inferred that it should have a power to decline to hear a matter which could properly be dealt with by a single judge. To the extent that a statute seeks to confer original jurisdiction which is not secondary to the Court’s appellate jurisdiction, it should be inferred that the Court has reasonable powers to avoid undue interference with the proper exercise of its primary appellate function.
	
	
	Thus, one ground upon which the Court might decline to hear an application is where the accused person was not legally represented below, so that he or she would be able to make a further application once legal representation was obtained. [7]  Similarly, if the application was made by a child, or if it were apparent to the Court that material information sought to be relied on had not been presented at the earlier hearing, or that circumstances were likely to have changed since the earlier application (all factors which might give rise to a further application in the court below) there might well be occasions when the Court could properly save the time which would otherwise be devoted to a hearing.
	
	
	The proper construction of s 67(1) is that the power it confers on this Court to hear a bail application is discretionary. With respect to the circumstances set out in paragraphs (a)-(d), it may well be that, in practical terms, it can be treated as a power coupled with a duty to exercise the power, although subject to the discretionary grounds identified in s 73. With respect to par (e), it should be accepted that the discretion to decline to exercise the power is a broader one. That is for four reasons. First, where the Act seeks to be prescriptive (as in s 72) or restrictive (as in s 68) it has used mandatory language; in s 67(1) it does not. Secondly, the power is, in any event, subject to the express power to refuse to hear an application (s 73). Thirdly, the express discretion to decline a hearing in s 73 is identified in terms which invite evaluative judgment and defy precise constraints. Fourthly, the proper construction of the Act should take into account the nature and function of this Court’s jurisdiction and thus the circumstances in which a hearing can properly be declined.
	
	
	Finally, it should be noted that s 75 provides no basis for a contrary conclusion; it does not mandate the holding of a hearing, but the nature of the hearing. It is convenient to turn to that topic, because it is relevant to the grounds on which the Court can properly decline to conduct a hearing into a release application.
	


Nature of hearing


	
	It is not entirely clear how broadly s 75 is intended to operate. It follows immediately upon the provision for a further application to the same court and clearly applies only in circumstances in which there has been an earlier bail decision. It is possible that it was intended to apply only to a further bail application in the same court, rather than to applications within the hierarchy identified in the earlier division conferring “additional powers”. On the other hand, it may apply in both situations. Clearly it does not apply to a first application in a court. The precise scope of s 75 need not be resolved; it is sufficient to assume that it would apply to an application in the Court.
	
	
	Apart from the use of the phrase “a fresh review” in Mawad, statements may be found in several cases, the first being R v Kugor, that an application is to be heard by this Court “de novo”. [8]  In Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Campbell [9]  R A Hulme J was more explicit, stating:
	


“This is not a review of his Honour’s decision; it is a de novo (or fresh) consideration of the question of bail ….”


	
	Similar language was used by the Court in Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Brooks, [10]  namely that the application “is to be determined by this Court afresh; that is, it is not an appeal from, or a review of, the decision of [the judge in the Common Law Division].”
	
	
	In each case, reference was made to Kugor, and, as in that case, the proposition appears to have been unchallenged and unexplored. Indeed, in Kugor the statement was said to be “common ground”; furthermore, Kugor involved a detention application by the Director, not a release application.
	
	
	The language of s 75 can give rise to difficulties in its application. To say that evidence or information (the rules of evidence do not apply) may be given “in addition to, or in substitution for,” the evidence at the earlier hearing, allows for the possibility of various hybrid forms of hearing. As in the present case, it is unlikely that the evidence relied upon at the earlier hearing will be discarded entirely. It is also quite likely that, as in this case, oral evidence may be called at the earlier hearing and witnesses cross-examined, but no oral evidence called at the later hearing.
	
	
	Section 75 is, in form, similar to (though not identical with) s 91 of the Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act 1998 (NSW), providing a form of appeal by way of new hearing from the Children’s Court to the District Court in care proceedings and ss 18-20 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW). Although the precise language varies, similar difficulties have arisen with their practical operation. These were discussed recently in the Court of Appeal in AG v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW). [11]  At least in a case where oral evidence has been called at an earlier hearing, it seems inevitable that this Court should be entitled to take account of findings, particularly as to the credibility of witnesses, made by the judge in the earlier proceeding. That suggests that the form of “new hearing” is to be approached with a degree of flexibility, depending upon the circumstances presented in the particular case. Indeed, the applicant accepted that, in the present circumstances, the Court would be entitled to have regard to the reasons of the primary judge.
	


Grounds for exercising discretion to refuse to hear an application


	
	Accepting that this Court has a discretionary power to refuse to hear an application for bail, it is necessary to identify the grounds upon which that power may be exercised. However, that task should be approached with caution. First, what follows is directed to the exercise of the Court’s powers under s 67(1)(e) and not other provisions; secondly, it is directed to the powers with respect to a release application and not any other application. It is also proper to note that the manner of exercise of the discretion cannot (and should not) be constrained within some predetermined framework. [12]  Appropriate guidance can only be developed on a case by case basis.
	
	
	Subject to these qualifications, three considerations will commonly be relevant and would be relevant in the present case. First, having regard to the appellate function of the Court, it may be appropriate for the Court to decline to hear an application if satisfied that the circumstances relied upon would permit a further release application to be made in the court below, pursuant to s 74(3).
	
	
	Secondly, although the jurisdiction of the Court conferred by s 67 is not to review the decision in the court below, it may well be the case that, unless an applicant can identify a possible error in the approach adopted by the primary judge or suggest that the outcome was in some sense unreasonable, this Court may refuse to hear the application on the basis that it has no reasonable prospect of success. The legitimacy of that approach may be supported by two specific considerations, namely the fact that the primary judge has had the opportunity to hear witnesses give evidence and that is not sought to be repeated in this Court, and further that the primary judge, as is commonly now the case, has provided detailed reasons for his or her decision.
	
	
	Thirdly, the appellate functions of the Court and the need to avoid undue interference with the exercise of those functions with respect to appellants seeking to challenge their convictions, sentences or interlocutory rulings, may allow the Court a broader discretion to decline to hear a bail application than would be the case in a trial court. That aspect of the discretion may also allow the Court to constrain the manner in which a bail application is sought to be presented, for example by declining to hear oral evidence which has already been considered by a judge below.
	
	
	A possible refusal to hear an application must always take into account that the applicant has been charged with, but not convicted of, a serious offence and is deprived of his or her liberty pending trial. It is in that context that the power is conferred on this Court to hear a release application and it is always a material factor in determining whether to refuse to hear such an application.
	


Merits of application


	
	The parties came to the hearing of this application ready to deal with the matter on the merits. Although any court faced with such an application is required to deal with it expeditiously, [13]  the Court sought assistance in relation to its powers and jurisdictions and the issues discussed above. Given those circumstances, it is appropriate that, in this case, the application should be dealt with on the merits.
	
	
	I agree that the application should be dismissed, for the reasons given by Davies J, subject to one qualification.
	
	
	The only qualification is that I would place significant weight, in favour of release, upon the difficulties which the applicant will undoubtedly face if he remains in custody in preparing his defence. The charges laid against him are numerous and will involve complex documentary records, including records of electronic communications and activities. At the time of the hearing of the bail application, the applicant did not have access to a computer in his current custody. Nevertheless, the evidence indicated that he would have access in the near future. In identifying the circumstances on which the present application is addressed, I would assume that that expectation will be fulfilled.
	
	
	The second aspect of the matter concerns the extent to which the applicant will be frustrated in preparing his case as a result of his incarceration, assuming reasonable access to a computer. His solicitor provided an affidavit, dated 5 November 2015, anticipating that there would be a large volume of material, both in written and electronic form included in the police brief, once it was served. The solicitor’s affidavit also sought to make good the need for close communication between solicitor and client in the preparation of any defence.
	
	
	These expectations should also be accepted. The nature of the alleged offending warrants such a conclusion. Nevertheless, in the absence of the prosecution brief, the real extent of the difficulties caused by incarceration can only be assessed in the broadest terms. At this stage, they do not warrant a finding that the other risks associated with release, identified by Davies J, are outweighed. Accordingly there remains an unacceptable risk within the terms of s 19 of the Bail Act.
	
	
	For completeness I note that the Bail Act refers, in ss 17(2)(c), 18(1)(o) and 19(2)(c), to endangering the safety of victims, individuals or the community. That language should not be understood to extend beyond the physical safety of individuals. A broader reading is unnecessary given that commission of a further serious offence if released from custody is a separate “bail concern” identified in s 17(2) and in s 19(2). Similarly, interfering with witnesses is a separate bail concern. In the present case, the material did not demonstrate that release of the applicant would create an unacceptable risk of endangering the physical safety of others.
	
	
	McCALLUM J: I agree that the application should be refused, for the reasons stated by Davies J. I have read the judgment of Basten JA in draft. I am not persuaded that s 67(1) confers any broader discretion on this Court, beyond the grounds expressly stated in s 73 of the Act, to decline to exercise the power to hear a release application or a detention application. However, I would respectfully agree with his Honour's analysis of the nature of such a hearing and particularly his Honour's conclusion at [28] that such hearings are to be approached with a degree of flexibility, depending on the circumstances.
	
	
	DAVIES J:   The applicant has been charged with 158 offences involving fraud. The offences include:
	


(1)   Dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage by deception contrary to s 192E(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The applicant is alleged to be an accessory either before or after the fact to such offences. The maximum penalty for this offence is ten years’ imprisonment.

(2)   Dealing with identification information to commit or facilitate commission of an indictable offence contrary to s 192J of the Crimes Act. The indictable offence is fraud. The maximum penalty for this offence is ten years’ imprisonment.

(3)   Causing an unauthorised computer function with intent to commit a serious indictable offence contrary to s 308C(1) of the Crimes Act. The serious indictable offence is fraud. The maximum penalty for this offence is the maximum penalty for fraud which is ten years’ imprisonment (s 192E of the Crimes Act).

(4)   Knowingly deal with the proceeds of crime offence contrary to s 193B(2) of the Crimes Act. The maximum penalty for this offence is 15 years’ imprisonment.

(5)   Knowingly direct activities of a criminal group offence contrary to s 93T(4A) of the Crimes Act.  The maximum penalty for this offence is 15 years’ imprisonment.


	
	On 9 November 2015 the applicant was refused bail by Schmidt J in the Supreme Court. The applicant now seeks bail from this Court pursuant to s 67(1)(e) of the Bail Act 2013 (NSW). The Crown opposes bail and says that no conditions imposed can adequately address the bail concerns.
	
	
	The application comes before this Court not by way of review of Schmidt J’s decision but as a de novo consideration of the question of bail: R v Kugor at [4]; DPP (NSW) v Campbell at [4]. Whilst accepting that this is the effect of ss 67 and 75 of the Act, I endorse the remarks of Adams J and Beech-Jones J in   Mawad at [6] and [49].
	
	
	I have read the judgment of Basten JA. The question of the power of the Court of Criminal Appeal to refuse to hear a bail application was not argued in the present matter and I would defer expressing any views on that question until an appropriate case arises. I agree, however, with his Honour’s view at [28] concerning the flexibility with which the hearing before this Court may proceed. In particular, I agree that this Court is entitled to take into account the findings of the judge in the earlier application, including findings in relation to the credibility of witnesses. A similar view had been reached by this Court in Mawad at [5] and [8]. Since the rules of evidence do not apply (s 31) no issue arises by reason of s 91 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).
	


Facts of the offending


	
	The general overview of the Crown case is as follows:
	
	
	Since May 2014, fraud investigators from multiple banks reported to NSW Police that they saw an escalation of what are commonly termed 'linking' frauds. These offences are highly organised and require a high degree of planning. Linking frauds involve the use of a mule who is recruited by a criminal group to open a new bank account (or use their existing account) for the purposes of receiving fraudulently obtained funds. The group gain access to the internet banking account of a bank customer (the victim) by unknown means although it is suspected that malicious software or a phishing attack (acquiring sensitive information by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication) is responsible. The mule attends a bank branch and produces an 'Authority to Operate' form effectively linking the bank account of the mule to the bank customer. Alternatively they simply open up a fraudulent joint account between the bank customer and the mule.
	
	
	On some occasions another person attends the bank with the mule and takes over the identity of the bank customer producing fraudulent identification in the bank customer's name. When the accounts are linked several large transactions are performed from the bank customer's account to the mule's account. The funds are then withdrawn in cash at multiple branches or transferred to other mules to be withdrawn in cash. The group has also utilised the funds to purchase gold and other electronic products. The group typically obtains tens of thousands or over a hundred thousand dollars in cash from every bank customer's account that they compromise. The group often commit various parts of the linking fraud in different states to hamper bank checks and law enforcement investigation into the offences. The group continuously change their modus operandi to combat law enforcement.
	
	
	The group utilise mules that are predominately foreign nationals, and in particular Korean and Chinese nationals, as another means to combat law enforcement as these persons have, on some occasions, left the country before they were able to be prosecuted for their involvement in the offences. Several of the Korean mules have been arrested and charged and have formally stated that they were recruited to participate in the group after seeing a job advertisement on the Korean classifieds website www.hoiunara.com. The mules were told to open a bank account and on some occasions multiple accounts, and provide full details of the account to their recruiters. These details include their internet banking username and password. The mules were often offered a fixed amount or percentage of any funds withdrawn.
	
	
	Investigators have identified the applicant, as a participant in a criminal group that is involved in committing these linking frauds. The applicant is alleged to be a high level member of the group responsible for the planning and preparation in order to commit the fraud offences. The applicant is also said to have directed other members of the criminal group to perform activities in furtherance of the criminal enterprise.
	
	
	The applicant has allegedly committed multiple preparatory acts in relation to the fraud offences. These acts include the unauthorised access into the internet bank accounts of multiple bank customers, the purchase of flights under false names for lower level members of the group to assist in the commission of the offences, conducting checks on bank customers to gain more identification information about them and the takeover of the mobile phone services of bank customers to facilitate the offences.
	
	
	In December 2014, Strike Force Cottenham was formed as a joint strike force between the NSW Police Force and the Australian Federal Police (AFP) to investigate these fraud offences. Several Internet Protocol (IP) addresses registered under the fictitious identities Adam Tram (Tram) and Adam Tran (Tran) were used in commission of these offences. These identities have been conclusively linked to the applicant through numerous means including documentation of the applicant using the identity with his partner Ara Jo, telephone intercept material with the applicant referring to himself as Adam Tran, CCTV of the applicant using the identity when he came out of a gold shop, witness photographic identification parades conducted, and a wallet found by a passerby on 11 April 2015 on the footpath outside 7 Rider Boulevard, Rhodes which was handed to police containing identification in the name of Tram as well as identification documents pertaining to the applicant. These documents included a fraudulent NSW driver’s licence in the name of Adam Tram depicting a photo of the applicant. The unit where the applicant was residing at the time of his arrest was also leased under the name of Adam Tram (or Tran - typographical error on lease documents) (DOB: 11/12/1980) and the applicant’s partner Ara Jo.
	
	
	Numerous identified IP addresses are said to be associated with the Tram and Tran identities that have been used in the commission of unlawful activity.
	
	
	These IP addresses have been used to gain unauthorised access to the internet bank account of multiple bank customers throughout Australia. The IP addresses have also been used to gain access to the accounts of mules, who on instructions have provided their internet banking username and passwords to the group. The accounts are usually accessed from these IP addresses well before the 'linking' of victim and mule accounts occurs. IP logs from Bendigo Bank show that the applicant accessed his own Bendigo Bank account taken out in his real name from all these IP addresses. The applicant also accessed a Bank of Queensland bank account taken out in the false name of Adam Tram from a majority of these IP addresses. Fraudulent transfers of funds from the bank account of victims to mules are almost always conducted from a mobile broadband device such as a 3G/4G smart phone or laptop computer with a 4G device attached (e.g. 4G USB dongle). This is a deliberate method employed to make tracing the IP more difficult.
	
	
	The applicant was arrested on 22 July 2015 at his residence. He was searched. Four mobile phones were seized from him as well as a Virgin credit card in the name of Hammed Assifi. That credit card was linked to one of the frauds involving Dion Warr.
	
	
	The total amount of the fraud in which the applicant was involved is said to be in excess of $6.5 million. This includes a little over $3 million of actual frauds and in excess of $3.5 million of attempted fraud.
	
	
	A search warrant was executed at the applicant’s premises and multiple SIM cards, documents, computers and data storage devices were seized. In particular, the following items were found:
	


(a)   A fraudulent licence in the name of John Smith with a picture of a koala on the photograph image. The applicant has a known nickname of “Koala” and there is some reference to “Koala” on telephone intercept material of the applicant.

(b)   There were multiple receipts for Louis Vuitton and Burberry purchases in the name Ara Jo. Jo is the partner of the applicant and several IP addresses linked to the applicant were registered in the names of Adam Tram and Ara Jo.

(c)    A Victorian change of name certificate for the applicant who has changed his name to Dinh Anh Khoi Mai. There was also a complete passport application in the name of Dinh Anh Khoi Mai where the applicant has listed his email address as kdat@iinet.com.au. This is the same email address that is registered under the Rider-Rhodes IP address.

(d)    A document pertaining to the funeral of Mark Easter. This relates to the applicant’s association with Easter as seen in the offence involving Fraser Motorcycles.

(e)    A shredded TAB card in the name of Raymond Huang. This relates to the Virgin credit card fraud where a card was applied for in the name of Raymond Hwang even though identification documents listed the cardholder as Raymond Huang.

(f)   A BankWest general account authority form for Mr G R Jiade Su providing authority to Yu-Chuan Ting. This authority form is similar to many authority forms used to facilitate the linking frauds.

(g)    A fraudulent NSW driver’s licence in the name of the applicant.


	
	The alleged offence involving Fraser Motorcycles (referred to in (d) above) was this. On 15 December 2014 the applicant attended Fraser Motorcycles Pty Ltd in Concord purporting to be Adam Tram. He made a finance application to purchase a Harley Davidson motorcycle with a total cost price of $22,000. He requested finance in the amount of $15,631.29. He produced a fraudulent NSW driver’s licence in the name of Adam Tram with his own photograph.
	
	
	That day Capital Finance received an Individual Finance Application from Fraser Motorcycles for Adam Tram. In the application the applicant specified numerous false details on his finance application. He provided a false payslip purporting to be from employer S D Exclusive Services. The payslip indicated that the pay was to Tram’s account number with Westpac. However, Westpac indicated that the account did not belong to Tram. The application for finance was subsequently declined.
	
	
	Two days later the applicant returned to Fraser Motorcycles and tried to pay $19,990 for the motorcycle in cash and have it delivered to Mark Easter at an address in Waterloo. The staff at Fraser Motorcycles refused to allow the motorcycle to be delivered to another party. Later that day Easter attended and paid that amount in cash for the motorcycle. Easter is said to be an associate of the applicant and it is alleged that he was involved in a fraud offence with the applicant in 2013.
	


Bail concerns


	
	The present offences are not “show cause” offences for the purposes of s 16A of the Act. Accordingly, it is necessary only for the Court to assess the bail concerns set out in s 17. In doing so it is to consider the matters listed in s 18. If the Court finds that any of the bail concerns constitute an unacceptable risk, s 19 requires the Court to refuse bail.
	
	
	Of the four bail concerns and unacceptable risks referred to in ss 17 and 19, the applicant concedes that the Court might find that there are concerns the applicant will fail to appear, might commit a serious offence and might endanger the safety of victims, individuals or the community. However, the applicant submits that there is no evidence to indicate that the applicant will interfere with witnesses or evidence.
	
	
	Section 18 of the Act provides:
	


18   Matters to be considered as part of assessment

(1)   A bail authority is to consider the following matters, and only the following matters, in an assessment of bail concerns under this Division:

(a)   the accused person’s background, including criminal history, circumstances and community ties,

(b)   the nature and seriousness of the offence,

(c)   the strength of the prosecution case,

(d)   whether the accused person has a history of violence,

(e)   whether the accused person has previously committed a serious offence while on bail,

(f)   whether the accused person has a history of compliance or non-compliance with bail acknowledgments, bail conditions, apprehended violence orders, parole orders or good behaviour bonds,

(g)   whether the accused person has any criminal associations,

(h)   the length of time the accused person is likely to spend in custody if bail is refused,

(i)   the likelihood of a custodial sentence being imposed if the accused person is convicted of the offence,

(j)   if the accused person has been convicted of the offence and proceedings on an appeal against conviction or sentence are pending before a court, whether the appeal has a reasonably arguable prospect of success,

(k)   any special vulnerability or needs the accused person has including because of youth, being an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, or having a cognitive or mental health impairment,

(l)   the need for the accused person to be free to prepare for his or her appearance in court or to obtain legal advice,

(m)   the need for the accused person to be free for any other lawful reason,

(n)   the conduct of the accused person towards any victim of the offence, or any family member of a victim, after the offence,

(o)   in the case of a serious offence, the views of any victim of the offence or any family member of a victim (if available to the bail authority), to the extent relevant to a concern that the accused person could, if released from custody, endanger the safety of victims, individuals or the community,

(p)   the bail conditions that could reasonably be imposed to address any bail concerns in accordance with section 20A.

(2)   The following matters (to the extent relevant) are to be considered in deciding whether an offence is a serious offence under this Division (or the seriousness of an offence), but do not limit the matters that can be considered:

(a)   whether the offence is of a sexual or violent nature or involves the possession or use of an offensive weapon or instrument within the meaning of the Crimes Act 1900,

(b)   the likely effect of the offence on any victim and on the community generally,

(c)   the number of offences likely to be committed or for which the person has been granted bail or released on parole.


	
	The applicant submits that the relevant matters for consideration are all of the matters listed in s 18(1) except (j), (k) and (m).
	
	
	The bail proposal is that the applicant would live with his parents in Lakewood Drive, Woodcroft. In his affidavit the applicant’s father says that he and his wife own the family home which has an equity of approximately $400,000. He said that he and his wife were willing to use the entire amount of the equity in the family home and in their other assets of about $30,000 as security for the applicant’s bail. Counsel for the applicant refined this to an offer of security in the sum of $320,000.
	
	
	The applicant’s mother says that she is prepared to cease working as the receptionist in their family real estate agency in Fairfield to be at home to supervise the applicant. Both parents say that they are prepared to have the internet disconnected at home and they will not allow him to use their mobile phones.
	
	
	The applicant is prepared to be subject to a curfew whereby he would not be absent from the Woodcroft property except in the company of his father and only to attend Court, to attend conferences with his lawyers, to report to police, to attend medical appointments and to attend church with his parents within defined hours on a Sunday. The applicant also offers to wear electronic monitoring.
	


Assessment of the bail concerns


	
	The overlap in the bail concerns in this matter requires consideration of them together. The Crown did not contend that the concern for the safety of the community included what was referred to as “economic safety”. However, the applicant had only one offence on his record as a 13 year old that could be regarded as an offence of violence.
	
	
	The applicant has been charged with a large number of fraud offences. The execution of the search warrant at his premises resulted in the finding of a number of identification documents suggesting that the applicant creates and uses other identities in the commission of some or all of the offences charged. Evidence otherwise obtained tends to show the adoption of false identities by the applicant. The facts suggest that many of the offences were committed by using IP addresses that gave unauthorised access to bank accounts of customers. In that way fraudulent transfers of funds were able to be made.
	
	
	The evidence identified in the Crown facts justify the conclusion that the Crown case against the applicant, at least in respect to a large number of the offences charged, is a strong one. Counsel for the applicant accepted that it is a reasonably strong circumstantial case. If the applicant is convicted of some but not all of the offences he is likely to face a lengthy time in custody. There is a strong incentive for the applicant not to appear. Considered in conjunction with how the offences were said to have been committed and in the light of the false identification material located there is a substantial concern that he has the facility to fail to appear and subsequently evade detection. That must also be seen in the light of his connections with Korea where he has spent long periods in recent times.
	
	
	The applicant’s criminal record does not assist him in that regard. It discloses four breaches of bail and a number of breaches of parole in respect of which warrants were issued for his arrest. The extent of his previous offending, most although not all of which involved offences of dishonesty, gives no confidence that he will not continue to commit further serious offences. It is also of concern that his custodial record discloses prison offences involving drugs since he went into custody in 2015.
	
	
	These concerns are submitted to be met by the bail conditions proposed. In substance those conditions require the applicant to be under house arrest and under the control and supervision of his parents. In addition, he would wear electronic monitoring.
	
	
	The likelihood of those conditions being successful in achieving the applicant’s appearance and in preventing him from continuing to commit serious offences is put in considerable doubt by the evidence given by his father before Schmidt J.
	
	
	Despite the applicant’s father saying that he had a close relationship with and was very close to his son Mr Trinh gave evidence that he did not know if his son had ever had any paid employment or jobs, that he could not recall seeing or having contact with his son either at the time of his son’s birthday, the birthday of his wife or himself in 2014 or 2015 or at Christmas, that he does not contact the applicant but leaves it for the applicant to contact him. In addition, Mr Trinh gave evidence that his son constantly changes his phone number, that when the police rang in August 2014 asking where his son lived he told them that he did not know where he lived. This evidence was then given:
	


Q. And the police tell you that there was a warrant out for your son's arrest as well, don't they?

A. Well they do but I say it is not my business. I can't control him any longer. I say to him like this.

Q. Did you speak to your son after, did you ever have a conversation with your son after the phone call with the police and say I spoke to police, they are looking for you?

A. No, they say, I inform them he always ring me.

Q. When he rang you for his next conversation did you tell him the police had rung you to speak to you about him?

A. What happening, I treat him as an adult. As the parent I was very concerned what he was doing. Every time I rang him I ask him what you are doing for a living now and he kept telling me, never told me. I know what he was doing but I don't have evidence what he was doing. I asked him what you do for a living. That is a parent. If you have a son or daughter you concerned about living, you ask the same questions and they tell you the truth or not true. It is up to them.

…

Q. Weren't you surprised to have the police ring you? When the police rang you were you surprised?

A. I was not surprised, no, because I thought maybe if police had rung and asked these things because I always say to the police he already an adult.

Q. He what?

A. Not under my care any longer. He not with me.

…

Q. When your son next called, why didn't you tell him the police are ringing and looking for you?

A. I very rarely talk to him. Maybe he could ring my wife but not all the time he walk [scil. talk] with me. (emphasis added)


	
	When re-examined, he was asked if he became aware that his son was in breach of his bail what would he do, he said “I definitely would report to the police, I would take (sic) to the police straight away.” In the light of his evidence about his response to the police ringing in August 2014, the evidence that he would report a breach of bail to the police can only be accepted with considerable reservations.
	
	
	The portion of Mr Trinh’s evidence above identified in bold was not elaborated on by request of either counsel appearing before Schmidt J. In circumstances where it is known what the applicant was doing and how he was making his money, Mr Trinh’s statement suggests more knowledge on his part than he was prepared to impart. That inference can also be drawn from what I take to be the evasive answers that he gave relating to contact with the applicant. I note in that regard what Schmidt J had to say about Mr Trinh’s evidence at [37]. Her Honour had the added advantage of seeing and hearing Mr Trinh give his evidence.
	
	
	Noting the applicant’s father’s evidence that he cannot control the applicant, that the applicant would not tell his father what he did for a living and that his father considers he has little responsibility because the applicant is an adult, there is nothing in the applicant’s mother’s evidence to suggest that she is in any better position to supervise or control him. That is particularly significant when the offences with which the applicant is charged are offences that can readily be committed by the use of computers or smart phones in the privacy of the house in which the applicant is living. Statements by the parents that they would not permit the applicant to have access to a computer or telephones must be treated with considerable caution in the light of the evidence of the applicant’s father.
	
	
	A further matter should be noted in relation to the proposal for control and supervision by the applicant’s parents. In respect of offences for which the applicant was charged as a young person including the serious offence of being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence, the applicant was released on bail conditions which required him to live with his parents and be subject to a curfew unless in the company of his parents. On three occasions he breached his bail conditions including being out during curfew hours. On one such occasion when he had been arrested and his father was contacted to say that he was in custody at Parramatta Police Station, Mr Trinh informed the police that he had not seen nor heard from his son for the past two weeks. On another occasion where he breached his bail the applicant informed the police that he had been kicked out of home by his parents and was not currently living anywhere in particular.
	
	
	Those matters indicate an inability or an unwillingness on the part of his parents to ensure that he comply with bail conditions whilst he was a young person. That elevates the significance of Mr Trinh’s statements in evidence before Schmidt J that he cannot control the applicant and that, in any event, the applicant is an adult who is no longer under his care. This is a matter relevant to the offer of the parents to provide a security on their home. Even assuming in their favour that they would endeavour to supervise and control the applicant, I have considerable unease that they will be able to do so. Moreover, I am not satisfied of the adequacy of the security when the amounts involved in the offending are considered.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant submitted that two considerations in s 18 were significant for the release application. The first was the delay before it is likely the matters will come to trial. The evidence of the applicant’s solicitor was that the trial would be unlikely to be completed before the end of 2017 or even early 2018. That is partly because of the amount of the material that needs to be served and assessed including telephone intercepts in multiple languages and also because of the likely length of the trial.
	
	
	The second matter concerned the ability of the applicant properly to prepare with the assistance of his lawyers his case for trial. In that regard, reference was made to the evidence from the applicant’s solicitor of the inability so far for the applicant to be given access to a computer or a laptop whilst in custody. Reference was made to the decision of R S Hulme J in Shalala v R [2012] NSWSC 351. In that case R S Hulme J said:
	


[19]   I turn to Mr Shalala's interests. On the evidence before me, it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that Mr Shalala is unable to prepare his case while incarcerated and this because the Corrective Services authorities have not provided him with a computer or other equipment on which to see or listen to the recorded evidence and there is nothing to suggest that their stance will change.

[20]   On the evidence before me, it seems also that there has been scant provision of any significant library facilities to Mr Shalala.

[21]   The evidence indicates, although there is a library at the MRRC where Mr Shalala is currently incarcerated, because of cut backs to prison staff, that library is practically inaccessible unless a Corrective Services officer can be spared at any particular time to supervise Mr Shalala.

[22]   The terms of s 8A of the Bail Act 1978 and the significance of the matters referred to in paragraphs (a) and (c) of s 32(1) of that Act 1978 are such that in the normal course I would unhesitatingly have refused Mr Shalala's application for bail. However, he is entitled to prepare his case. Given that he is effectively being prevented from doing so whilst in custody by the attitude of the Corrective Services, I feel constrained to give him bail.


	
	Evidence from the applicant’s solicitor attests to the attempts he has made to have the applicant issued with a laptop whilst in custody to assist in the preparation of the matter for trial. As at the end of March 2016 his efforts had been unsuccessful. However, an email from an officer of the Department of Corrective Services dated 24 March 2016 said that laptops were being issued over the 7-10 days following the email to eligible inmates of whom the applicant was one. By the date the present bail application was heard the applicant did not have a laptop.
	
	
	Although s 18(1)(l) lists the need for the accused person to be free to prepare for his or her appearance in court or to obtain legal advice, it is not immediately apparent how that assists in the assessment of the bail concerns in s 17. I accept, however, that it is likely, as McCallum J suggested during the course of argument, that s 18 is directing the Court to undertake an evaluative weighing exercise of competing concerns, some of which are concerns of the person seeking bail that they be able to prepare their defence adequately and, for that matter, not be detained without conviction for a lengthy period of time.
	
	
	In the light of the evidence that the applicant is to be included in the initial rollout of laptops I do not consider that his need to be free to prepare for his trial is a matter of great weight. It is significant in that regard that in Shalala the applicant was appearing for himself and preparing his own defence without the assistance of lawyers.
	
	
	In relation to delay it may be accepted, as this Court said in R v Kugor at [35] that it is a very serious matter to deprive a citizen of liberty for a long period of time when he has not been convicted of any offence. The delay being considered by the Court in that case was a period of about 15 months. The applicant was arrested on 22 July 2015. As noted, the evidence from the applicant’s solicitor is that his trial is unlikely to conclude until the second half of 2017 or early 2018. That time in custody prior to conviction is a matter of considerable significance on a bail application.
	
	
	Although it is entirely unsatisfactory that an accused person should because of delays in the justice system, be detained in custody prior to trial for lengthy periods, that is but one factor to be considered when assessing bail concerns to see whether they rise to the level of unacceptable risk. In the present case, the earlier matters to which I have referred seem to me to outweigh the significance of that delay. The seriousness of the charges, the nature of the offending, the amounts involved, the strength of the Crown case, the applicant’s prior criminal record when considered with the entirely unsatisfactory relationship with his family and the proposed arrangements involving them lead me to the conclusion that there is an unacceptable risk that the applicant will fail to appear at any proceedings and will continue to commit serious offences.
	
	
	In my opinion, bail should be refused.

2240876,R v Parker (No 2) [2016] NSWSC 813,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Marianne Parker was charged with the murder of her husband, Kenneth Parker, to which she pleaded not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. After a trial, a jury found her not guilty of murder and in accordance with her plea, guilty of manslaughter.
	
	
	Criminal cases that come before this Court involving an unlawful death are without exception, tragic. The victim’s life has been cut short, usually violently. Some cases are particularly sad. This is one of them. Here the life and death of the victim is extremely tragic. But so too has been the life of the offender, added to which is her palpable and obvious grief and remorse at the loss of her husband.
	


The Victim


	
	It is most unfair to describe a victim’s life in summary form because it omits all but the most relevant to this crime and usually excludes the happy times and the emotional attachment of his family. But to understand this crime, one must understand certain traits of the victim and their relationship to the crime.
	
	
	The victim is of Aboriginal descent. Born 6 July 1963 and 50 years of age at the time of his death. His older brother William gave evidence in the trial.
	
	
	They seemed to have a close early childhood which was affected when, at 13 years of age, the deceased was out on one of the family’s regular shooting expeditions. Present were the deceased, his two older brothers and his sister and their father. During the expedition, the deceased’s gun accidentally discharged shooting the father and resulting in the father’s death.
	
	
	William, the older brother, noticed as they grew older, that the event had a huge effect on the deceased, even though the family supported him and made it clear that he was not to blame.
	
	
	The deceased started abusing alcohol in his teens and eventually commenced self-harm. The older brother saw the results of each and in the case of self-harm, saw the injuries to his body including cuts to his chest and to his arms.
	
	
	The self-harm continued and was a feature of the deceased’s life at the time of his death. So too did the alcohol abuse. There was a short time during a previous relationship, where they were minimised. But as at the relevant time, they were a sad and tragic aspect of the victim’s life.
	


The Incident on 16 December 2013


	
	It is necessary to set out briefly the bare facts of the incident that resulted in the victim’s death. It is unnecessary at this juncture to summarise the evidence but to the extent it is relevant to sentencing, I will deal with some of it later in these remarks.
	
	
	As earlier stated, the incident occurred on 16 December 2013. The deceased and the offender were drinking heavily, all day.
	
	
	During the evening, the deceased commenced self-harm inflicting significant wounds on himself, in particular a deep wound to the chest. Notwithstanding my earlier comment as to evidence, I will give the basis for that conclusion.
	
	
	The forensic evidence disclosed that wounds including the chest wound were caused by a sharp instrument such as a knife. From the blood stains and smears, it is clear that the deceased was wounded in the chest while facing a closed screen door. He was standing approximately 40 centimetres from the closed door when the wound was inflicted.
	
	
	There can be no suggestion that someone other than the deceased inflicted those wounds. Further, there is no evidence to suggest that two knives or two sharp instruments were used to cause injury to the deceased.
	
	
	As a consequence, the offender had dispossessed the deceased of his knife and thereafter inflicted the fatal injury. There was only one injury inflicted by the deceased, being a stab wound to the back which unfortunately struck him between two ribs, punctured his lung and caused a minute transection of the artery and vein shown up in microscopic sections of the ninth right intercostal artery. It was these transections caused by the stab wound to the back, close to the spine, that caused death.
	
	
	The deceased walked outside the door, sat on the porch step and then on the path, and died. At the time of his death, he was being attended by neighbours and others, who had been alerted by the offender.
	
	
	The offender and the deceased had been drinking most of the day and were drunk. The deceased’s alcohol concentration at the time of death was 0.25 grams per hundred millilitres of blood. There is no reason to believe that the offender’s blood alcohol concentration was significantly less, and she was still well affected by alcohol at 12.30am on 17 December (some five hours after the stabbing).
	
	
	The offender had been arrested on 16 December 2013 and could not be questioned until the next day because of her intoxication. She has remained on remand in gaol since 16 December 2013 on account of this offence.
	


The Offender 


	
	It is necessary to describe some aspects of the offender in order to understand the objective seriousness of the offence. First, it is appropriate to point out that even within serious crimes such as murder and manslaughter, it is necessary to determine the relative objective seriousness of the offence within the range of circumstances covered by the offence.
	
	
	The offender has severe impairment of her executive functioning and is placed in the bottom one per cent of the population in that respect. Dr McMahon, a clinical psychologist, qualified by the Crown, tested the offender and made the aforementioned finding. Indeed, as explained by Dr McMahon, one test similar to a children’s game like I Spy, had to be abandoned because of the offender’s inability to organise her thought processes.
	
	
	Each psychiatrist diagnosed the offender with cognitive disorders of some kind and each expressed the opinion that the effect of the alcohol on her cognitive disorders, and lack of executive functioning, would have exacerbated her inability at emotional regulation and her inability to judge right from wrong, and to control her actions: see, for example, Dr Allnutt, qualified by the Crown, at transcript page 282.
	
	
	The defence case to murder was the lack of intent and, in the alternative, substantial impairment of the mind. Often the law, for good reason, separates issues into categories. However, some cases involve an inextricable inter-weaving of the categories.
	
	
	In this case, there was clearly an underlying abnormality of mind exacerbated by alcohol. The combined effect on the psychiatric evidence leaves the Crown in a position that it has not proved beyond reasonable doubt that the offender formed, even momentarily, an intention to kill the deceased or to cause him really serious injury. Nevertheless, that was the effect of her conduct.
	
	
	To the extent that it be necessary, I should also make clear that the offender did not contemplate the risk of death before proceeding regardless. The evidence establishes that a reckless disregard for human life was a state of mind of which the offender was, in this instance, incapable.
	
	
	In any event, the defence has proved on the balance of probability, if there were intent on the part of the offender, that there was a substantial impairment of the mind giving rise to diminished responsibility.
	
	
	There are arguably aggravating features: the use of a weapon and the offender’s criminal record. The use of the weapon, in circumstances where there is no intent to injure, is less significant.
	
	
	The prior criminal record, which includes acts of personal violence, does not increase the objective seriousness of the offence, but does render retribution, deterrence and the protection of society, more of a concern warranting greater attention: see, inter alia, Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465 (‘Veen (No 2)’); R v McNaughton [2006] NSWLR 566; 163 A Crim R 381; R v Shankley [2003] NSWCCA 253.
	
	
	While this offence did occur in the deceased’s home, it was also the offender’s home and ought not be regarded as an aggravating feature.
	
	
	Overall, the relative objective seriousness of the offence is not at the lowest range. But it is below mid-range in objective seriousness.
	


Subjective Circumstances


	
	Some of the subjective circumstances of the offender have been mentioned already. I will not repeat them, but they relate to the criminal history and the psychiatric disorder.
	
	
	The offender is also Aboriginal; she is a Wiradjuri woman. She attended school until year 7 and was raised in households in which physical, sexual and alcohol abuse were evident. Her parents separated.
	
	
	At one stage, the offender was required to live with her grandparents and ran away from home in 1972, aged 14, and worked in Sydney. She married Kevin Sheady at the age of 16 and had four children in that relationship, the first at 17 years of age. One child was adopted out.
	
	
	The relationship involved some violence and the couple separated causing the offender to lose custody of her children. The offender was then involved in a number of very abusive relationships.
	
	
	Her mental health issues have been noted over many years, and she has a record of alcohol and drug abuse before imprisonment.
	
	
	I turn then to the prospects for rehabilitation and to remorse. Unlike some offenders, with severe cognitive disorders, Ms Parker has managed to learn behaviours that, in the absence of alcohol abuse, overcome many difficulties.
	
	
	This incident shows examples of it. The offender has developed learned behaviours in living skills and to cope with anxiety.
	
	
	Due in part to the extraordinary dedication of local police, she was taught to ring police when distressed. On 16 December 2013, the offender rang police. Unfortunately, the officers were unavailable or could not be reached. Had they been, we may not be at this point. But I must comment on my admiration for the police, involved with the deceased and the offender, who exemplify the kind of conduct that is needed if society is to deal appropriately with domestic violence, with those suffering mental issues and with Aboriginal incarceration.
	
	
	The offender was tested 20 months after the death of her husband. She had not consumed alcohol in that time. Yet her tests still reveal severe cognitive disorder. Nevertheless, the offender has been in gaol for nearly three years and has not consumed alcohol. If that situation can be a learned behaviour pattern, her prospects of rehabilitation are good. But she will need significant time under supervision in the community and for that reason, I find special circumstances.
	
	
	Her early background gives rise to Fernando considerations (R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58), but there is no discount on the basis merely of race: Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; (2013) 249 CLR 571.
	
	
	I turn then to remorse. The offender has no memory of the events on 16 December 2013. As one of the doctors testified, it is possible that the deceased stepped back onto the knife.
	
	
	In my view, such a possibility would not have been accepted by a jury properly instructed. However, Ms Parker never relied on such a possibility. Despite her lack of memory, the offender formally and informally accepted that she stabbed the deceased.
	
	
	The offender pleaded guilty to manslaughter at the earliest opportunity. It is appropriate to afford her a 25% discount for that plea: s 22 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
	
	
	The plea, the acceptance of guilt and her conduct, disclose profound remorse. She displayed that to the psychiatrist and the remorse was obvious from the offender’s conduct during the trial and sentencing proceedings.
	
	
	The offender has strong family support and, in my view, is unlikely to re-offend.
	


Conclusion


	
	Sentencing involves the synthesising of various goals which may pull in different directions. They include the protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others tempted to offend, retribution and reform: s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) and the High Court judgment in Veen (No 2).
	
	
	I have been taken to a number of cases. But comparisons in manslaughter cases are particularly problematic. Even more problematic is the recourse to statistics, which involves the perpetuation of sometimes unwarranted limitations. Rather, consistency is achieved by the consistent application of principles.
	
	
	The maximum sentence is 25 years’ imprisonment. This is a guidepost reserved for those guilty of manslaughters in the worst category. There is no standard non parole period. The offence is below mid-range. It was neither planned nor premeditated.
	
	
	The offender, other than the issues already mentioned, was unaware of the consequences of her actions because of her mental state and her intoxication. One of the more intriguing aspects of this case is the offender’s real immediate distress at the injury caused and somewhat oddly the deceased’s expressed view, while bleeding to death, that the offender ought not go to gaol for this: see, the evidence of Nita Carr, transcript 155-156. The distress of the offender continues. Specific deterrence is not a major issue and the offender’s mental issues make her an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence.
	
	
	Nothing I can do can bring the deceased back. Rather, I must impose a sentence consistent with others in the manner described, which seeks to achieve the goals I have recited.
	
	
	I consider a head sentence of 10 years imprisonment is appropriate as a starting point. I do not, given the seriousness of the offence, consider a non-custodial sentence or one that is not full time, would adequately reflect the offence. Nor would either achieve the previously mentioned goals in this case.
	
	
	The sentence will date from the date of arrest, to take account of the time served already for this offence. As earlier stated, I allow 25% for the plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity and I find special circumstances.
	
	
	MARIANNE PARKER, please rise:
	


You are convicted of manslaughter, in that on 16 December 2013, at West Wyalong, you did unlawfully kill Kenneth Wayne Parker.

You are sentenced to a non-parole period of four years’ imprisonment, commencing 16 December 2013 and concluding 15 December 2017, with a further term of three and a half years concluding 15 June 2021. You are first eligible for release on parole on 15 December 2017.

2240883,R v Fuller [2016] NSWSC 815,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: The offender, Owen Junior Fuller, has pleaded guilty to murder having killed Corey Mark Power. The Court must sentence him.
	
	
	The offence of murder is the worst offence in the criminal calendar carrying a maximum sentence of life imprisonment and a standard non parole period of 20 years. The imposition of a life sentence is for those murders that are within the worst category of murder and in which the offence “is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition” of such a sentence.
	


Facts


	
	There are agreed facts. Many deal with the deceased in a detail that, while relevant to background in order that the Court understand the issues, are unnecessary to repeat.
	
	
	The deceased was 33 years of age at the time of his death, the offender was just over 18 years of age.
	
	
	Briefly stated, on 7 August 2013, the offender and another broke into premises and stole a vehicle and some tools. The two co-offenders drove to an address and rang the deceased to leave the tools with him. The deceased told the offender and his accomplice in the robbery to burn the motor vehicle.
	
	
	The deceased drove to Canberra from Young and sold the tools, then returning to Young. He was at the time, it seems, living in Canberra. There is a suggestion that the offender and his robbery accomplice were never paid for the tools and the deceased owed them $600.
	
	
	From 25 August 2013, the deceased was staying in Young at the house of persons who were mutual acquaintances of the deceased and the offender. The deceased was consuming drugs.
	
	
	In the meantime, the offender and his robbery accomplice were exchanging text messages expressing anger and resentment toward the deceased and his failure to pay the money said to be owed. The messages became increasingly hostile towards the deceased and disclosed increasing anger. Reference was made to assaulting the deceased. They then discussed with each other the fact that the deceased had returned to live in Young.
	
	
	At 3.57am on 29 August 2013, the deceased sent two messages to the Facebook account of another female friendly with each of the deceased and the offender. The offender, who had previously been in a relationship with this woman, gained access to the account. The offender knew the password.
	
	
	The woman was absent from Young on 29 August 2013 and had been for some two weeks or more. By a series of messages, the offender, pretending to be the Facebook account holder, lured the deceased to a location (the Weir), where he assaulted the deceased.
	
	
	The offender had sought unsuccessfully to contact the robbery accomplice but met the deceased alone. According to the accused’s record of interview, the murder occurred as follows.
	
	
	The deceased walked towards the offender, the offender punched him at which point the deceased fell to the ground. The deceased got to his feet and the offender punched him again. At that point the deceased did not get to his feet and the offender considered the deceased may have been “knocked out or something”. The offender had a tomahawk down his back, pulled it out and repeatedly hit the deceased with the blunt end.
	
	
	The attack with the blunt end of the tomahawk killed the deceased.
	
	
	The offender told police that he was not “even angry” with the deceased. It seems if there were motive it was the failure to pay the $600 debt and a fear that the deceased was going to disclose the robbery for which the offender may be imprisoned. The offender denied to police that there was a monetary motive and I accept that.
	
	
	The offender did describe to the psychologist the feeling that he could not stop once he had started and that it was as if he was observing another inflicting the injuries.
	
	
	The circumstances of the offence render it serious even by the standards of murder. Leaving aside those aspects inherent in murder itself, the offence involved some planning by the offender when he lured the deceased by deceiving him into thinking the deceased was not communicating with the offender. I accept that the method was opportunist resulting as it did from the unexpected access to Facebook messages. Nevertheless the intention to assault the deceased predated the event and the method utilised discloses premeditation.
	
	
	Further, the offence involved gratuitous violence beyond that necessary to carry out the offence. The attack with a tomahawk is properly described as frenzied. The offence also involved the use of a weapon but I do not double count that factor and include it in assessing the offence itself only.
	


Subjective Circumstances


	
	As earlier stated the offender had just turned 18 years of age at the time of the offence; he was 18 years and two months. His youth is a most significant factor.
	
	
	I have the advantage of a psychologist’s assessment and report, it discloses some ameliorating background.
	
	
	The offender emanates from Wagga Wagga and is of Aboriginal descent. His early childhood was violent as his father was physically abusive. His parents separated when the offender was four years of age.
	
	
	Whether the offender was in late primary school, his mother handed custody to his father and stepmother because, according to the offender, his mother was unable to control the offender. The violence continued.
	
	
	His education was interrupted by moves, his misbehaviour and the time spent in juvenile detention. The offender was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder and hyperactivity (ADHD) and with Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD). ODD involves an increased risk of antisocial behaviour, impulse control problems, substance use, anxiety and depression.
	
	
	The offender has a long criminal history which, for obvious reasons, was as a juvenile. He was first before the Courts at age ten. He has been a regular consumer of alcohol since he was 13. At that age he also commenced consuming ecstasy and cocaine having previously experimented with cannabis.
	
	
	The offender is of average intelligence if not above average with an IQ of between 92 and 106. Ms Robilliard, the psychologist qualified on behalf of the offender, administered the Hare Psychopathy Checklist Revised (PCL-R) and expressed the opinion that the offender’s score strongly suggested psychopathy. Other tests suggested he was approaching significance in sadistic, aggressive attributes.
	
	
	Ms Robilliard concluded that the offender “demonstrates a symptom pattern consistent with psychopathy”. This overlaps with personality disorders such as antisocial disorder and narcissistic traits. He displays a callous disregard for the integrity of others and a lack of remorse. He has “a severely disturbed and distorted self-concept with regard to his violent behaviour. His non-significant score on the aggressive/statistic scale also suggests that his psychopathic personality is well entrenched and overriding reality.”
	
	
	Further she stated that the offender’s feeling of belonging in juvenile detention and also in adult custody indicated a degree of identification with the mores of the criminal subculture exemplified by a recent attack on a fellow inmate for a purpose he describes as “to ensure his own safety in the hierarchy of prison population”.
	
	
	The offender’s psychopathic profile may prevent him from having access to certain treatments in the prison system, because it may exacerbate maladaptive behaviour by improving his ability to manipulate.
	
	
	It seems his intelligence would enable him to acquire education and skills but he would be unable to interact freely until he can demonstrate improved self-control. This would probably require individual psychotherapy with an experienced professional.
	
	
	The offender has acted out cruelly to animals and other persons from a young age. He does not display genuine remorse. Rather any expression of regret is focused on the effect on him.
	
	
	The offender pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. At the time of his interview by police on these charges he was serving a sentence for other offences in Queensland and was extradited to New South Wales in December 2014. The Queensland sentences’ non-parole period expired on 4 March 2015 and the offender has been in New South Wales prisons since that date. I apply the principles of totality in regard to the relationship with the Queensland offences.
	


Conclusion


	
	Sentencing is never an easy task. Sentencing in a situation such as this is difficult. There are a number of Form 1 offences which may be used only to increase the sentence for murder and not to impose sentences for the other offences listed. The increase in the sentence arises as a result of an assessment that there are good grounds for treating specific deterrence and retribution as more significant. There are eight Form 1 offences to which I have regard, each is serious and five involve the infliction of injury.
	
	
	Murder, as already stated, is the most serious offence in the criminal calendar and the maximum sentence reflects the value our society places on human life.
	
	
	As has been said on a number of occasions, even with an offence as serious as murder, one must assess the relative objective seriousness as compared to all murders. One does not however assess an offence by imagining a worse scenario.
	
	
	This murder, while horrific, is not in the worst category. It does not involve an intention to kill, but, rather, an intention to inflict really serious injury. Nevertheless the circumstances of the limited premeditation and the frenzied attack put the offence objectively well above mid-range in seriousness.
	
	
	The purposes of sentencing are: protection of society, deterrence both specific and general, retribution and reform. The Court synthesises these sometimes overlapping, sometimes competing, goals and seeks to derive a sentence that reflects each of them.
	
	
	The seriousness of the offence must be assessed with the abusive and deprived early childhood, the plea of guilty, the protection necessary when dealing with a potential psychopath or someone with such traits and the youth of the offender. I reiterate my remarks in BP v R [2010] NSWCCA 159, including my agreement with the late Hodgson JA.
	
	
	This offender was a boy, only just 18 and quite immature. Nevertheless the offence is not one that displays particular immaturity. He also has displayed some remorse and acceptance of responsibility with his plea of guilty. I intend to allow a discount for that plea but not to the full extent of 25% and I take that into account in fixing a sentence that is overall appropriate: s 22 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
	
	
	Like Adams J in R v Robinson [2000] NSWSC 972, were it not for the offender’s youth, the offence, the psychological assessment and the need for protection would warrant a severe sentence. There are significant risks of reoffending and a total disregard for authority and the norms of behaviour.
	
	
	The risk in imposing a less severe sentence on a psychopath or someone showing such tendencies is ameliorated slightly by the existence of a regime including continuing detention orders, and the like, if psychotherapy is either unavailable or unsuccessful.
	
	
	An extended period of parole is unnecessary and I do not find special circumstances. I start from a sentence of 32 years.

2240928,Wu v R [2016] NSWCCA 96,"Judgment


	
	WARD JA: The applicant, Mr Wu, pleaded guilty on 19 May 2015 in the Local Court to two counts of conspiracy to engage in market manipulation contrary to ss 1041A and 1311(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and s 11.5 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (together, “the market manipulation offences”) and one count of dishonestly using his position as a director, contrary to ss 184(2)(a) and 1311(1) of the Corporations Act (“the dishonesty offence”). He was committed for sentence to the Supreme Court with his co-conspirators (Mr Dulhunty and “PR”) both of whom had also pleaded guilty to charges relating to the market manipulation offences.
	
	
	Following a sentencing hearing on 9 December 2015, Mr Wu was sentenced on 18 December 2015 (R v Wu [2015] NSWSC 1877) to an overall term of imprisonment of 2 years and 9 months, commencing on 18 December 2015, with an effective minimum term of 9 months. His co-conspirators had earlier been sentenced on the market manipulation offences committed by them (R v Dulhunty; R v PR [2015] NSWSC 1747) by the same sentencing judge to an overall term of imprisonment of 1 year and 6 months (in the case of Mr Dulhunty) and consecutive terms of 11 months and 7 months (in the case of PR) but with an effective minimum term in each case of 6 months.
	
	
	Mr Wu seeks leave pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) to appeal against the sentences imposed on him. In substance, he contends that the sentencing judge erred: in the determination of the discount to be applied for his assistance to the authorities (ground 1); in imposing a longer sentence for the dishonesty offence than the market manipulation offences (ground 2); and by substantially accumulating the sentence for the dishonesty offence upon the sentences for the market manipulation offences (ground 3).
	


Background


	
	Mr Wu was aged between 27 and 32 at the time of the offending, which occurred between 1 May 2007 and 17 November 2011. He was raised in China. He undertook tertiary education in Malaysia and New Zealand before moving to Australia in 2002. He obtained a Bachelor of Commerce and a Master of Commerce from the University of Western Sydney and became an Australian citizen on 21 May 2007.
	
	
	In 2004, Mr Wu became involved in a business operated by his mother manufacturing health products in Australia for export to China. A decision was made to expand the business. For those purposes, Mr Wu engaged a consultant, Mr Dulhunty, who recommended that the business become a public listed company on the Australian Securities Exchange. Mr Wu followed that advice. Healthzone Pty Ltd (Healthzone) was publicly listed on 6 November 2006. Mr Wu and Mr Dulhunty were appointed the directors of Healthzone.
	
	
	After the public listing, Mr Dulhunty introduced Mr Wu to another man (“PR”) as being another consultant who could assist the business. PR was ultimately appointed as the executive chairman, managing director and chief executive officer of Healthzone.
	
	
	The market manipulation offences (counts 1 and 2) concerned a conspiracy between Mr Wu, Mr Dulhunty and PR to manipulate the price of Healthzone shares between 1 May 2007 and 17 November 2011. In furtherance of the conspiracy there was a total of 637 trades, involving the purchase of 3,899,078 shares and an overall investment of $1,390,597. Although counts 1 and 2 related to a single continuing conspiracy, they were the subject of separate charges because there was an increase during the conspiracy period of the maximum penalty for the offence (from imprisonment for 5 years and/or 2,000 penalty units to imprisonment for 10 years and/or 4,500 penalty units).
	
	
	Mr Wu had assisted the authorities relating to the investigation of PR on a charge of conspiracy to defraud arising out of the same circumstances that formed the basis of Mr Wu’s dishonesty offence, and has undertaken to give evidence at his forthcoming trial.
	
	
	Following the application of a combined discount of 35% for his guilty plea and assistance to the authorities, Mr Wu was sentenced on count 1 to imprisonment for 7 months commencing on 18 December 2015 and expiring on 17 July 2016 and on count 2 to imprisonment for 9 months commencing on 18 July 2016 and expiring on 17 April 2017. The total sentence imposed for the market manipulation offences was thus a term of imprisonment for 1 year and 4 months.
	
	
	Count 3 concerned Mr Wu’s dishonest use of his position as a director of Healthzone to gain an advantage for PR. He did so by assisting PR to obtain the benefit of a $1,000,000 loan from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia to Healthzone in circumstances where he knew that PR would use the loan contrary to its stated purpose. He accepts that, in so doing, he misled Healthzone’s lawyers, its board of directors and the Bank. Healthzone was placed in external administration and was subsequently liquidated. The loan funds were not recovered.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the dishonesty offence was imprisonment for 5 years and/or 2,000 penalty units. For this offence Mr Wu was sentenced, following an application of the combined discount of 35%, to imprisonment for 1 year 8 months commencing on 18 January 2017 and expiring on 17 September 2018.
	
	
	The sentencing judge ordered that Mr Wu be released upon recognisance after serving 9 months in prison and be subject to a good behaviour bond for a period of 2 years (ss 19AC and 20(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth)).
	
	
	In the earlier sentencing of Mr Wu’s two co-offenders in respect of the market manipulation offences, the sentencing judge had noted that the sentences reflected a discount “at the uppermost level” for their guilty pleas (see R v Dulhunty; R v PR at [103]). Neither of Mr Wu’s co-offenders, unlike Mr Wu, was entitled to a further reduction of sentence by reason of any assistance to the authorities.
	
	
	PR is due to be tried for those offences this year (T 58.42ff). For this reason, publication of the judgment from which Mr Wu now seeks leave to appeal has been suppressed and orders were made at the commencement of these proceedings similarly suppressing publication of these reasons and any identification of PR’s full name until further order.
	


Sentence judgment


	
	At the sentencing hearing, the Crown tendered lengthy statements of facts, the content of which was largely agreed by the conclusion of the sentencing hearing. The sentencing judge set out those facts at [6]-[7] of his reasons.
	
	
	Mr Wu gave evidence at the sentencing hearing and, although his Honour was not able to accept aspects of his evidence in their entirety, he formed the view that Mr Wu was doing his best to be truthful ([52]).
	
	
	Tendered at the sentencing hearing was a statement given by a senior manager employed by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) detailing the assistance rendered by Mr Wu in relation to the fraud proceedings brought against PR and an undertaking given by Mr Wu to give evidence for the Crown at PR’s trial, attached to which was a comprehensive statement by Mr Wu to ASIC, largely dealing with the dishonesty offence but also his relationship with his co-offenders. These were admitted at the sentencing hearing as confidential exhibits. Those exhibits were before the Court on the hearing of the present proceedings. The sentencing judge was satisfied that Mr Wu’s assistance (up to the point of the committal of PR for trial) had been important and substantial and that it would continue to be so ([100]). There is no dispute as to that.
	
	
	The sentencing judge assessed the offending in counts 1 and 2 (the market manipulation offences) as being of “considerable seriousness” ([62]). In so concluding, his Honour had regard to: Mr Wu’s motivation (which he found had included a perceived obligation to his mother to protect her “legacy” but also a desire to protect his significant shareholding in the company, though not the prospect of or desire for immediate financial gain) ([54]-[55]); Mr Wu’s knowledge that what he was doing was illegal, though noting that Mr Wu had little or no experience in matters of share trading and the like ([56]); Mr Wu’s expressed fear of the consequences which might follow if PR were to leave Healthzone (a factor of marginal relevance in his Honour’s eyes) ([57]); and Mr Wu’s concerns about the conduct of a perceived “hostile investor” in the company (though his Honour noted it was not appropriate to respond to that behaviour by engaging in serious criminal offending) ([58]).
	
	
	The sentencing judge did not accept that Mr Wu should be regarded as an instigator of the conspiracy, in the sense of being the architect of it or having devised it; though he accepted that Mr Wu was clearly a participant in the conspiracy from an early stage ([59]). His Honour considered that there was little to differentiate between the level of participation of, or roles played by, each of the three offenders in the conspiracy, noting that the principal point of distinction was that Mr Wu’s participation extended over a period of more than four years, whereas that of his co-offenders was over three years ([59], [111]).
	
	
	His Honour also noted that the offending: extended over a considerable period; involved multiple trades worth substantial sums of money; was carried out in a way which was both calculated and planned; but was not particularly sophisticated in that it did not involve the use of false names or other forms of subterfuge ([60]). His Honour also noted that the offending had the capacity to threaten the integrity of, and public confidence in, the stock market and to cause damage to members of the community who had invested their savings into that market; the price of the shares having been manipulated and distorted ([61]).
	
	
	As to the dishonesty offence, count 3, the sentencing judge said (at [63]):
	


The offending in count 3, although of a different kind, was equally serious. It was not confined to a single act. Over a significant period of time, the offender engaged in continued deception, practiced upon a number of persons and organisations, in the full knowledge that what he was doing [was] wrong, and in circumstances where the end result was an advance of a substantial sum of money to PR, and a corresponding loss to Healthzone. In acting as he did, the offender engaged in a serious misuse of his position as a director of Healthzone. Moreover, in circumstances where he had some knowledge of PR’s financial difficulties, the offender must have been aware, at the very least, that PR would have difficulty repaying the loan according to its terms. (my emphasis)


	
	His Honour considered that the offending in count 3 was mitigated to some degree by the fact that Mr Wu derived no benefit at all from the offending. His Honour also accepted that Mr Wu was placed under some pressure by PR, in the sense described in the context of the offending in counts 1 and 2; but again expressed the view that it was not an appropriate response to deal with those concerns by engaging in serious criminal offending ([64]).
	
	
	As to the subjective case, the sentencing judge listed, by reference to s 16A of the Crimes Act, (at [65]) various factors to be taken into account, those being the degree of contrition, the guilty plea, the degree of assistance, the personal characteristics of the offender, the prospects of rehabilitation and the probable effect that any sentence or order would have on the offender’s family or dependants.
	
	
	His Honour noted (at [81]) that the Crown had raised no issue in respect of a number of aspects of Mr Wu’s subjective case. The Crown accepted that: Mr Wu had entered a plea in the Local Court and was entitled to a discount at the uppermost level ([82]); Mr Wu had expressed remorse for his offending ([83]), his Honour there making the express finding that Mr Wu was genuinely remorseful; Mr Wu would suffer significant extra-curial punishment as a consequence of being disqualified on conviction from holding any position as a company director for five years ([84]); Mr Wu’s prospects of rehabilitation were generally positive ([85]); and Mr Wu was a person of no prior convictions and generally of good character ([86]).
	
	
	In relation to the last factor, his Honour was nevertheless of the view that, even allowing for Mr Wu’s mental state (he having been diagnosed with an adjustment disorder as well as depression), general deterrence remained an important factor and said that the fact that the offending in respect of all counts had occurred over an extended period lessened the weight to be given to prior good character ([86]).
	
	
	Having earlier considered the evidence as to Mr Wu’s state of health, the sentencing judge concluded that: notwithstanding Mr Wu’s mental state, general deterrence remained important and must be given significant weight in the sentencing process in respect of all counts, the offending in each case being sustained and planned; personal deterrence had no real role to play, having regard to the expression of remorse; and Mr Wu’s mental state and a diagnosed condition of Meniere’s disease might render a custodial sentence more onerous ([95]).
	
	
	His Honour also accepted that the imposition of a custodial sentence would have an adverse impact upon Mr Wu’s widowed mother, who was not in good health and living in China with no one immediately available to look after her ([96]-[98]), though his Honour concluded that the effect of a custodial sentence on the mother would not be exceptional and considered that this circumstance was not one which attracted substantial weight ([98]).
	
	
	His Honour concluded that Mr Wu’s subjective considerations were stronger “in some respects” than those of his co-offenders, particularly insofar as his health issues were concerned ([111]).
	
	
	As to the determination of the discount to be applied, his Honour said (at [106]):
	


There is no fixed tariff in respect of a discount for an offender’s co-operation. However, the customary range for a combined discount which encompasses a plea of guilty and assistance has been expressed as being 20% to 50%: see for example SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19 at [43]-[44] per Buddin J (Howie J and Simpson J (as her Honour then was) agreeing. However in R v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92 Howie J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL agreed) observed (at [5]) that because of the general recognition that it was no longer inevitable that an offender who has provided assistance will serve any custodial sentence in more difficult conditions, sentencing courts should reduce the range of discount to reflect the fact that one of the bases of the discount is no longer generally applicable. His Honour went on to observe that it should now be accepted that an offender who has provided assistance will not necessarily be disadvantaged within the prison system and, if the offender wishes to assert otherwise, he must lead evidence of that fact. In his Honour's view, this meant that absent such evidence, a discount in excess of 40% should be very exceptionally applied, if at all. That general approach has since been endorsed by the Court of Criminal Appeal: AB v R [2013] NSWCCA 333 at [36]-[38] per Schmidt J (Leeming JA and Hall J agreeing).


	
	His Honour noted that there was no evidence that a custodial sentence would be likely to be more onerous as a result of Mr Wu’s assistance to the authorities and that his Counsel had expressly indicated that “there was no major issue in terms of the offender’s security” ([107]). His Honour concluded that:
	


In these circumstances, the upper end of the range of combined discount for the plea and assistance is one of 40%. In my view, the combined discount in the present case should be one of 35%, 5% of which shall be referable to the offender’s future assistance. In my view, this discount should be applied to all of the offences before the court.


	
	His Honour concluded that no other sentence than a sentence of imprisonment was appropriate having regard to his conclusion that the offending in all three counts was of considerable seriousness and that general deterrence was important. His Honour considered that the starting point for the sentences to be imposed on Mr Wu in respect of counts 1 and 2, before the application of any discount, should be the same as the starting point applied in the cases of his co-offenders (namely 7½ months imprisonment for count 1 and 9½ months imprisonment for count 2); and that, since the offending in count 3 was quite separate from counts 1 and 2 (though also arising from his position in Healthzone), there must be some accumulation. All but three months of the sentence for count 3 was accumulated.
	


Application for leave to appeal


	
	As noted earlier, there are three proposed grounds of appeal if leave to appeal is granted. I will consider each in turn.
	


Ground 1 – discount for assistance

1.   The learned sentencing judge erred in determining the discount to be applied for the applicant’s assistance to the authorities. In particular:

   (a)   The discount was inadequate;

   (b)   The learned sentencing judge failed to have due regard to the adequacy of the discount in terms of the actual reduction in the length of the sentence;

   (c)   The learned sentencing judge erred in holding that the “upper end of the range of combined discount” for plea and assistance was 40%; and

   (d)   The applicant was denied procedural fairness.


	
	There was no dispute at the sentencing hearing that the assistance given by Mr Wu had been significant. The Crown accepted that, so far as it could tell, it was genuine. The Crown prosecutor submitted that it was very important from the regulator’s point of view that “people who do what this man had done, get the benefit of it, and publicly so that it can help in relation to not just this matter”.
	
	
	Mr Wu notes that the Crown’s position at the sentencing hearing in relation to the appropriate discount was that it would be greater than that given to the co-offenders and at the higher end of the scale. The oral submissions made for Mr Wu at that time were to the effect that there were no artificial limits on the discount; that the Act “forces you out of percentages and into months and years”; and it was suggested that the appropriate discount in the present case would be between 40-50%. In exchanges with the sentencing judge, Mr Game SC, appearing for Mr Wu, accepted the proposition that 50% was generally speaking a “high water mark” for this kind of case:
	


HIS HONOUR:   … the authorities generally say, do they not, that 50 per cent is a high water mark?

GAME:   In a situation like this it would be, yes. Otherwise you have to be in the situation of extreme danger and multiple, ongoing assistance to the authorities in ongoing investigations. There is none of that.

HIS HONOUR:   Does it get as high as that in this case?

GAME:   Maybe not, but not far off.


	
	Having regard to the broad principles identified in R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 (at 252Dff per Hunt and Badgery-Parker JJ) applicable to the discount to be given for assistance provided to the authorities and to the rationale for reducing a sentence by reason of assistance to the authorities summarised in Isaac v R [2012] NSWCCA 195 (at [46]), it is submitted for Mr Wu that his assistance called for a substantial discount, and that he did not receive that.
	
	
	It is noted that the sentencing judge found that the important and substantial value of Mr Wu’s assistance went both to past and future assistance. Mr Wu points out that his assistance not only included the provision of his very lengthy statement to ASIC but also (referring to the evidence given by him at T 30.42-48) that he had voluntarily assisted liquidators by answering questions about the affairs of the company. His Honour accepted that Mr Wu’s disclosures were not tailored in any sense ([104]). Emphasis is placed on the fact that Mr Wu signed an undertaking to give evidence as a Crown witness in the trial of PR and it was accepted at the sentencing hearing that he would be an important and valuable witness because he was in a position to give direct evidence about the conspiracy. Mr Wu also points to the finding that his decision to co-operate was motivated by genuine contrition ([103]).
	
	
	The complaint that Mr Wu did not receive a “substantial” discount is made by reference to the fact that the combined discount of 35% included a discount (that his Honour had said should be at the “uppermost level”) for his early guilty plea.
	
	
	In that regard, Mr Wu submits that a discount at the “uppermost” level for his guilty plea would indicate a discount in the order of 25%, and that it can be inferred that this was the case by reference to the sentences imposed for his co-offenders (who were entitled to and received no discount for any assistance to the authorities). Having regard to the indication by the sentencing judge that the starting point for the market manipulation offences should be the same as that applied for his co-offenders, Mr Wu submits that it can be discerned the co-offenders received a 25% discount for their guilty pleas. He argues that since his Honour said that all three offenders should receive discounts at the uppermost level, it must be concluded that the discount allowed to Mr Wu for both past and future assistance to authorities was in the order of 10% (of which his Honour expressly attributed 5% to the anticipated future assistance, hence the discount for past assistance was similarly 5%).
	
	
	It is submitted that such a discount does not meet the public interest or policy of the law in encouraging offenders to come forward and assist the authorities in investigating and prosecuting other offenders. In particular, Mr Wu argues that the discrete component of the discount given for his future assistance (of 5%) is inadequate having regard to the likelihood that he will be giving “protracted and valuable evidence in a complex fraud conspiracy trial”.
	
	
	It is submitted that the public interest served by the discount for assistance to authorities is pronounced in the case of white-collar crimes that are relatively easy to commit and difficult to detect and prosecute; and which often involve illegal combinations or joint criminal conduct (such as conspiracy offences).
	
	
	In oral submissions, emphasis was placed on the further argument (ground 1(b)) that it was not sufficient for the sentencing judge to focus on the quantum of the percentage discount to be applied. It is submitted that his Honour was obliged, in determining the adequacy and appropriateness of the discount, to consider the actual effect (in terms of the actual reduction in months) of the discount on Mr Wu’s sentence.
	
	
	It is submitted that a percentage reduction results in a lesser benefit to an offender who is to receive a shorter sentence. Reference is made to what was said by Basten JA in SL v R [2015] NSWCCA 30 at [13]:
	


There is another sense in which disproportion may not be properly reflected in the actual “proportion” by which a sentence is reduced. The reduction could be measured by reference to years, rather than a percentage. In terms of length of imprisonment, a percentage reduction will give a greater benefit, the more serious the offender’s criminality. On the other hand, the person who plays the lesser role in the offending and may face a relatively shorter sentence than the co-offenders against whom the assistance is provided, may nevertheless be at equal or greater risk as a result of providing assistance to the authorities than an offender who committed more serious offences. Thus a 25% reduction of a four year sentence is one year; the same proportionate reduction of a 12 year sentence is three years. The mechanical exercise (applying a percentage reduction), may, in some cases, fail fully to serve the purpose of the reduction for assistance to authorities. (The percentage reduction is appropriate in the case of a guilty plea.)


	
	Mr Wu argues that the “mechanical” application of a percentage reduction in the present case failed fully to serve the purpose of the reduction for his assistance to authorities. Insofar as there is no indication in the sentence judgment that consideration was given to the adequacy or otherwise of the discount for assistance in light of the actual reduction in time of the sentence, Mr Wu argues that there was error in the sentencing exercise in the House v The King sense (House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499).
	
	
	It is also submitted (ground 1(c)) that the sentencing judge erred in applying the reasoning of Howie J in R v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92; (2006) 172 A Crim R 151 (at [5]), in effect that, absent evidence that an offender who has provided assistance will be disadvantaged within the prison system, “a discount in excess of 40% should be very exceptionally applied, if at all”.
	
	
	Reference is made to the comments made in this regard by Basten JA in R v DW [2012] NSWCCA 66; (2012) 221 A Crim R 63 at [14]-[15] and to the caution expressed in that case by RS Hulme J at [145]. At [15], Basten JA said:
	


… The remarks in Sukkar appear to require the courts to assume there will be no deprivation, in the absence of evidence to the contrary. However, in relation to future administrative actions of the custodial authorities, it is difficult to know what information an offender could usefully give, confident that it would apply after the sentencing. Arguably, the obligation of the Director to lend every assistance should apply in this, as in other respects, in relation to the consequences of the assistance: cf R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 at 254B (Hunt and Badgery-Parker JJ). ...

(Reference is also made to what was said in C v R [2013] NSWCCA 81; (2013) 229 A Crim R 233 at [40] and R v Charman [2007] NSWSC 1177 at [20]-[21]).


	
	It is submitted that, although the sentencing judge correctly acknowledged that there is no “fixed tariff” in respect of a discount for an offender’s co-operation, his Honour applied the observations in Sukkar in a way that “artificially” and erroneously constrained the discretion to be exercised and erroneously treated the percentile figure of 40% as being the upper end of the range of combined discount for the plea and assistance. It is argued that this had a manifest effect in terms of capping, and hence diminishing, the discount ultimately applied to Mr Wu’s sentence and that his Honour acted upon a wrong principle by constraining the exercise of his discretion in this way (giving rise to the basis for appellate intervention: R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220 at 230C; R v Ehrlich [2012] NSWCCA 38; (2012) 219 A Crim R 415 at [6]-[7]; Z v R [2014] NSWCCA 323 at [32]-[33]).
	
	
	It is further submitted that his Honour’s reliance upon the absence of evidence of a more onerous impact of custody due to Mr Wu’s assistance to authorities was misplaced because it failed to account for the fact that he was on bail at the time of sentence; and that his Honour erroneously relied upon the “express” indication from counsel that there was no major issue in terms of the offender’s security. As to the latter, the relevant exchange appears at T 2.38, in the context of a discussion as to whether there was a need for Mr Wu’s name to be anonymised in the sentence judgment. Mr Wu notes that Mr Game SC then went on to say, at T 3.22, when applying for Mr Wu’s evidence to be given in camera:
	


I say we don't have particular security concerns but we would have if you sentence Mr Wu to imprisonment, then there can't be a judgment on the Internet.

and that, immediately after the sentence of actual imprisonment, a recommendation to correctional authorities was sought from, and granted by, his Honour concerning Mr Wu’s safety in custody.


	
	Finally, it is submitted that there was procedural unfairness in that the exchanges between the sentencing judge and counsel during the course of the proceedings were apt to leave Mr Wu with an understanding that his Honour intended to apply a discount that would be “significant” and would “be one that approaches the high water mark” of 50%. Mr Wu argues that there was no suggestion in the proceedings that a discount below 40% was in contemplation and hence Mr Wu was denied the opportunity to put submissions in respect of the “inadequate discount” ultimately applied to his sentence.
	


Crown response


	
	As to the complaint that the discount for assistance was inadequate, the Crown accepts (as it did at the sentence hearing) that Mr Wu deserved a substantial sentence discount to reflect the nature and extent of the assistance he had provided and had promised to provide to law enforcement agencies. However, it is submitted that the discount Mr Wu did receive was substantial and that a combined discount of 35% was appropriate and in accordance with the general range of sentence discount identified by the authorities; and that, whether expressed as a percentage figure or calculated as a period of time, it does not demonstrate error in the exercise of his Honour’s discretion.
	
	
	The Crown submits that Mr Wu’s complaint in this regard is essentially as to the weight to be given to a mitigating factor and notes that the circumstances in which matters of weight will justify intervention by an appellate court are narrowly confined (referring to what was said in Chan, Lo & Nguyen v R [2010] NSWCCA 153 per Kirby J at [65], with whom Beazley JA, as her Honour then was, and Johnson J agreed; in R v El Hani [2004] NSWCCA 162 per Howie J at [91]; and in Hutchinson v R [2014] NSWCCA 317 per Fullerton J at [32], with whom Hoeben CJ at CL and Adamson J agreed.
	
	
	In oral submissions, the Crown conceded that one might infer, from the sentence imposed on PR and having regard to the comments that his Honour made in sentencing Mr Wu, that the discount given for past assistance in Mr Wu’s case was 5%, though the Crown makes the point that the sentencing judge did not specify that the discount for the guilty plea was 25% in Mr Wu’s case. The Crown argues that even if the relevant discount was 5% for past assistance and 5% for future assistance, this does not demonstrate that there was an error in the exercise of his Honour’s discretion, noting that the co-offenders’ guilty pleas meant that there was remorse, contrition and willingness to accept responsibility for their offending as Mr Wu did. The Crown’s submission in any event was that, had his Honour given a greater discount for the combined assistance and plea, it nevertheless could not have led to a situation where no custodial sentence was imposed at all because that would fail to reflect the principle of general deterrence.
	
	
	The Crown points to the need for the discounted sentence not to be disproportionate to the objective gravity of a particular offence and the circumstances of a particular offender; and argues that it is both artificial and wrong in principle for Mr Wu to seek to demonstrate error by dissecting the combined discount into percentages that were purportedly allowed for the guilty pleas and for assistance. The Crown refers to what was said by Gleeson CJ in R v Gallagher at 227-228 to the effect that matters such as a plea of guilty, expression of contrition and willingness to co-operate with authorities form a complex of interrelated considerations. The Crown submits that the attempt to demonstrate error by isolating the nominated 5% discount for future assistance and then considering the adequacy of that component of the sentence alone is also wrong in principle.
	
	
	The Crown submits that there is no basis for this Court to draw the inference that the sentencing judge failed to have regard to the actual effect of the discount on Mr Wu’s sentence, in terms of the actual period of reduction in time to be served, simply because this matter is not referred to expressly in his Honour’s sentence judgment and argues that this amounts to no more than speculation on Mr Wu’s part. In any event, it argues that a comparison between the undiscounted sentences and the actual sentences shows that there was a substantive and meaningful reduction in Mr Wu’s head sentences from 4 years 2¾ months in total (to be released after 1 year and 1¾ months) to imprisonment for 2 years 9 months to be released after serving a period of 9 months. It also submits that the fact that the minimum time to be served (9 months) represented only 27% of the aggregate head sentence (of 2 years 9 months) indicates that his Honour was mindful of the actual period of incarceration that Mr Wu would be required to serve. It is submitted that, while there is no fixed percentage or statutory ratio which applies to the fixing of a minimum term for a federal offender under the Crimes Act, in the present case the ratio between the time to be served and the head sentence reflects the fact that a significant degree of leniency has been extended to Mr Wu. Hence it submits that, even if there were an error as contended for by ground 1, on re-sentencing, the overall sentence would not be lesser than the one imposed due to the need to have regard to the principle of general deterrence.
	
	
	As to the remaining complaints by Mr Wu, the Crown notes, first, that the fact that he was on bail at the time of sentencing did not prevent him from putting forward evidence (or submissions) as to the possibility of additional hardship in this case; or of his intention to apply for protection within the prison system, and second, that Mr Wu was not denied the opportunity of making submissions as to the appropriate level of combined discount for plea and assistance. Rather, the question of the possible range for the discount was squarely raised by the parties before his Honour, both in written submissions and in the sentencing hearing. The Crown points out that in its written submissions in reply, dated 8 December 2015, specific reference was made to R v Sukkar and the relevant principles at [44]-[47]. Reference is also made to the exchanges between his Honour and counsel at T 93:43 -T 94:67. It is submitted that Mr Wu cannot now complain of procedural unfairness in circumstances where the Crown clearly submitted that the top of the customary range in a case such as this was 40% not 50%; he did not clearly dispute that range or the correctness of Sukkar; there was no evidence of additional hardship; and it was conceded that the assistance was not “in the astronomical range”. It is submitted that his Honour’s indication that the assistance would approach the high water mark did not preclude a discount that fell below 40%, having regard to all the circumstances of the case.
	


Determination


	
	In relation to the sentencing for a federal offence, although a guilty plea must specifically be taken into account (pursuant to s 16A(2)(g) of the Crimes Act), there is no requirement for a discrete identifiable percentage discount to be nominated for the reduction of a sentence on account of an offender's guilty plea; nor is there a requirement to identify the level of discount for assistance by a discrete percentage (apart from the need to comply with the statutory requirement within s 16AC(2) of the Crimes Act). In Ma v R [2010] NSWCCA 320, for example, where there was a combined discount at first instance of 35% for the plea and for assistance, of which 6% was for future assistance, Schmidt J observed that the percentage discount for the guilty plea could not be assumed to be 25%.
	
	
	In the present case, however, as an arithmetical exercise it can be inferred that the combined discount for past and future assistance must have been in the order of 10%. Reasonable minds may differ as to the amount to be applied for the level of assistance Mr Wu rendered in the past to the authorities (and will render in the future). However, I see no error in the House v The King sense in the assessment by his Honour that a 35% combined discount was appropriate to reflect both the guilty plea and the assistance to authorities.
	
	
	As to the application of a percentage discount rather than a discount specified or calculated by reference to a particular number of months, there was similarly no error of principle relating to the exercise of the sentencing judge’s discretion. His Honour applied the combined percentage discount in a manner consistent not only with authority but also with the way in which the parties had submitted that his Honour should approach the issue of sentence discounts.
	
	
	The fact that a percentage reduction will result in a lesser benefit (in terms of actual months) to an offender who is to receive a shorter sentence is an obvious consequence of the fact that there is a lesser head sentence to which the percentage is applied. A 35% reduction to a 25 year sentence, for example, will obviously produce a reduction of some years whereas a 35% reduction of a 1½ year sentence can arithmetically only result in a reduction of months. However, I consider it unfair to the sentencing judge to suggest that the percentage discount was applied as a “mechanical exercise” without an assessment of the practical effect of that discount. I do not accept that the primary judge’s reasons reflect a “mechanical” or artificial approach to the discounts to be allowed.
	
	
	The determination of the ratio between head sentence and minimum sentence of itself must have involved the sentencing judge taking into account the minimum amount of time he considered it appropriate that Mr Wu should remain in custody. The operation of the combined discount on the head sentence did not produce such a disproportionate result, in my opinion, that it would bespeak an error of the House v The King kind.
	
	
	Nor am I persuaded that a combined discount of 35% (including a 5% discount for future assistance and an amount in the order of 5% for past assistance) does not serve the public interest in encouraging offenders to assist authorities in relation to this sort of crime.
	
	
	As to the complaint that his Honour applied the reasoning in Sukkar in some artificial way, again I consider that criticism to be unwarranted. His Honour took into account the customary range for a combined discount; the observations made by Howie J in Sukkar to the effect that a discount in excess of 40% should only very exceptionally be applied (in the absence of evidence as to the position of disadvantage within the prison system by reason of having provided assistance); and to the endorsement of that “general approach” by this Court in AB v R [2013] NSWCCA 333 at [36]-[38]. It is clear that the sentencing judge was speaking in terms of a general approach, not some artificial or rigid cap. Applying that general approach to the circumstances of the case before him, the sentencing judge considered the “upper end” of the range of combined discount to be 40%. I do not read the reasons for sentence as indicating that his Honour treated his discretion as constrained in this regard.
	
	
	As to the complaint that Mr Wu was on bail at the time and could not provide evidence of disadvantage, not only was it open to him to have made submissions as to any perceived disadvantage arising from his giving of assistance to the authorities, but also the submissions made by his Counsel proceeded on the basis that this was not an exceptional situation (see the passage extracted at [34] above).
	
	
	Finally, there is no basis for the submission as to a failure to accord procedural fairness. His Honour discussed with Counsel what would be regarded as the customary range for a combined discount where (as here) no major issue as to Mr Wu’s security in prison had been raised in that context. All that could reasonably have been drawn from those exchanges was that his Honour was contemplating a combined discount towards the upper end, but not at the top, of the customary range. His Honour did not suggest that the combined discount could not be less than 40%; nor could it reasonably be inferred from the discussion that any decision to that effect had been made. If the top end of the range for this kind of case was (as Counsel for Mr Wu himself seems to have suggested to his Honour) somewhere between 40-50%, then all that can be said is that a combined discount of 35% was towards the top end of that lower range marker. That conclusion does not evince a lack of procedural fairness. There is nothing to suggest that Mr Wu did not have the opportunity to make as comprehensive submissions to the sentencing judge as he wished in respect of the combined discount; nor to suggest that his Honour did not properly take into account the submissions that were made on Mr Wu’s behalf.
	
	
	The primary judge took into account the relevant sentencing considerations and applied a combined discount that was within the customary range. Ground 1 is not made out.
	


Ground 2


	
	The second ground of appeal relates to the comparative severity as between the respective market manipulation offences and the dishonesty offence. It is contended that:
	


2.   The learned sentencing judge erred by imposing a more severe sentence for the dishonesty offence than the total sentence imposed for the market manipulation offence.


	
	This turns principally on a semantic issue, namely what was meant by his Honour when he said (at [63]) that the offending in count 3 “although of a different kind, was equally serious” (my emphasis), given that his Honour then said (at [64]) the offending in respect of the dishonesty offence was mitigated “to some degree” by the fact that Mr Wu himself had derived no benefit at all therefrom.
	
	
	Mr Wu submits that, on his Honour’s reasoning, a lesser sentence (or at least a sentence of no greater severity) should have been imposed for the dishonesty offence. Mr Wu (somewhat ironically given the complaint about mechanical application of percentile figures) thus argues that he has received a sentence 25% longer than the total sentence imposed for two counts of market manipulation. Mr Wu argues that the internal inconsistency in the sentencing outcome is reflective of error and that his Honour erred by imposing an unduly severe sentence for the dishonesty offence.
	
	
	The Crown submits that his Honour did not find (at [63]) that the dishonesty offending and the market manipulation offending were of precisely the same seriousness (and says that such a finding would have been highly unusual given the different objective circumstances involved). It submits that, in context, his Honour was stating no more than that the dishonesty offence was also an offence of considerable seriousness and hence there was no internal inconsistency in his Honour’s approach in setting a marginally longer sentence for the dishonest use of position offending.
	


Determination


	
	I do not read his Honour’s reasons as demonstrating any internal inconsistency in this regard. The dishonesty offence involved, as his Honour’s reasons take into account, separate and discrete criminality of a different kind to that involved in the market manipulation offences. It involved misuse of a trusted position and the aggravating features noted by the sentencing judge at [63]. As I read what his Honour said, it was simply that, as was the case with the market manipulation offences, the dishonesty offence was of considerable seriousness, not that there was some precise equivalence in the assessment of objective seriousness of each.
	
	
	The ultimate sentence for the dishonesty offence was in my opinion far from being unduly severe in all the circumstances to which the sentencing judge referred.
	
	
	Ground 2 is not made out.
	


Ground 3 – accumulation


	
	The final ground of appeal relates to the accumulation of the respective sentences:
	


3.   The learned sentencing judge erred by substantially accumulating the sentence for the dishonesty offence upon the sentences for the market manipulation offence.


	
	For Mr Wu, it is accepted that there was no issue in the sentence proceedings that there should be some degree of accumulation between the sentences for the market manipulation and dishonesty offences (referring to the transcript at T 59.41-59.46, 62.24-62.30) but he complains that the sentence for the dishonesty offence was almost entirely accumulated (all but 3 months) upon the sentences for the market manipulation offences. It is submitted that this structure offends the principle of totality and resulted in an unduly severe overall sentence.
	
	
	Mr Wu acknowledges that his Honour had a broad discretion in structuring the individual sentences but submits that the decision to accumulate the dishonesty offence to such a marked degree failed to give due recognition to the common aspects of the different offences and thereby involved error. Reference is made to the discussion in R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540; (2000) 118 A Crim R 66 per Simpson J, as her Honour then was, at [8]-[12], and refers to what was said by the plurality in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 per McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ at [45]-[47] as to the need for consideration to be given to questions of totality.
	
	
	Mr Wu points in this regard to the following matters: the offences were committed during the same period of time; the offences involved common participants (PR being a key participant in both matters); the offences concerned the affairs of the same company; and (which is emphasised by Mr Wu) in respect of both offences he was placed under a substantial degree of pressure by the dominance of PR. Mr Wu notes that he did not instigate either offence and did not directly benefit from either offence (rather, he and his family suffered significant losses in respect of both offences).
	
	
	The Crown argues that, in applying the principle of totality, the question is whether the sentence for one offence can comprehend and reflect the criminality of the other offence and submits that, subject to the principle of totality, it may be appropriate to impose significantly cumulative sentences for separate serious offences in order to signal to would-be offenders and the community at large that additional criminality will attract additional punishment.
	
	
	The Crown argues that the facts identified by Mr Wu as “important commonalities” do not compel a conclusion that there was an error in the exercise of discretion. The Crown accepts that the offending was partly contemporaneous; that in each instance the offending occurred while Mr Wu held a position as a director of Healthzone; that one of his motivations for the offending was his desire to protect his family’s personal and financial interests in the company; and that his relationship with PR was a contributing factor to the commission of the offences. However, it submits that those general circumstances do not provide a basis for substantial concurrency in sentences. It notes that each of the offences involved distinct criminality of considerable seriousness and submits that an aggregate sentence which reflected the seriousness of the total criminality of Mr Wu necessarily required a substantial degree of accumulation.
	
	
	The Crown points to what was said in R v Harris [2007] NSWCCA 130; (2007) 171 A Crim R 267 at [46], the Court (McClellan CJ at CL, Hulme and Hislop JJ) there emphasising the need to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice when sentencing for multiple offences by endorsing the remarks of Sully J in R v Wheeler [2000] NSWCCA 34 at [36]- [37].
	


Determination


	
	In my opinion, the extent of accumulation between the sentence for the dishonesty offence and the sentences imposed for the market manipulation offences does not demonstrate error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. The market manipulation and dishonesty offences involved separate courses of conduct: on the one hand a co-ordinated and planned conspiracy which involved the commission of multiple trades and large amounts of money over a period of four years to the detriment of the market integrity of Healthzone listed shares; on the other the defrauding by Mr Wu and PR of the Bank (and the company) of a substantial sum of money in a series of events spanning seven months.
	
	
	There was distinct and discrete criminality in the respective offences and it cannot be said in my opinion that the significant degree of accumulation reflected a failure to take into account or apply the principle of totality. No error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion such as to warrant appellate intervention has been established.
	
	
	Ground 3 is therefore not made out.
	


Conclusion


	
	For the above reasons, I would grant leave to appeal and dismiss the appeal.
	
	
	PRICE J: I agree with Ward JA.
	
	
	ADAMSON J: I agree with the orders proposed by Ward JA, for the reasons given by her Honour.

2241061,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 49) [2016] NSWSC 577,"Judgment EX TEMPORE - REVISED


	
	In the course of the re-examination of the accused McNamara yesterday, an issue was raised by Mr Wendler (who appears for McNamara) regarding the permissible limits of one proposed area of re-examination. Having heard submissions from all counsel at that time, I concluded that the proposed re-examination should not be allowed and indicated that I would give my reasons this morning for reaching that conclusion. Those reasons now follow.
	
	
	In order to put this matter in context it is necessary to briefly recount two particular passages of the cross-examination of McNamara by Mr Thomas, who appears for Rogerson.
	
	
	Mr Thomas commenced (at T3553 L3) to cross-examine McNamara concerning the time at which he initially met Rogerson. He put to him that he had met Rogerson about five years ago, a proposition with which McNamara agreed. McNamara went on to agree (at T3553 L11) that this was in about 2011.
	
	
	The cross-examination then turned to the fact that in 2012 McNamara had made arrangements with Rogerson to attend the launch of a book that he (McNamara) had written. Commencing at T3553 L41 the following evidence was given:
	


Q. You invited Mr Rogerson to attend your book launch?

A. Subsequently, yes.

Q. And you gave him two copies of your books, that is a copy of each book?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you agree?

A. Yes.

Q. And you wrote in the front cover some words to him which made a reference amongst other things to you thanking him for his wisdom?

A. For his?

HIS HONOUR

Q. For his wisdom?

A. I would accept that, yes.


	
	Subsequently, commencing at T3751 L30, the following evidence was given:
	


Q. Can I show you these two documents here, please (shown). I asked you some questions previously concerning you penning the inside cover, I think it was, of the two books that you had authored at a book launch and giving them to Mr Rogerson?

A. Yes.

Q. Can you just read, please ‑ are they copies of what you penned on the inside of each of the books that you gave Rogerson?

A. Yes.

Q. Can you read the first one out?

A. The ""Dirty Work"" inside jacket, ""To Roger, thanks for everything"", and I've signed it. And the second one ""Savage Obsessions"" in which he provided input ""To Roger, my sincere gratitude for your advice and wisdom"", and I've signed it.

THOMAS: I tender it.

HIS HONOUR

Q. Mr McNamara are you able to tell me when you signed the inside cover of the ""Dirty Work"" book?

A. Approximately, yes, would have been shortly after the release of ""Savage Obsessions"" so the first quarter, May 2012.

Q. What about the inscription on ""Savage Obsessions""?

A. ""Savage Obsessions"" at the same time.


	
	Copies of the covers of each of McNamara’s books, bearing the respective inscriptions to which reference was made, became Exhibit R47.
	
	
	Mr Wendler indicated that he wished to now re-examine McNamara in respect of matters said to arise from this evidence. He submitted that the effect of Mr Thomas' cross-examination was that he had raised Rogerson's character, so as to allow evidence to be given in re-examination which impugned that character. When I inquired of Mr Wendler (at T4061 L42) as to the precise evidence he would seek to elicit from McNamara if the re-examination were permitted, he explained that he would firstly ask McNamara whether he still held the opinion or belief that Rogerson was a “person of wisdom”. Mr Wendler indicated that he expected, if that question were put, that McNamara's answer would be ""no"". Assuming that were the case, he indicated he would then ask McNamara why this was so. He indicated an expectation that McNamara would answer in terms ""that the only wisdom that he received from (Rogerson) was how to effectively manipulate and fabricate the case in (Rogerson’s) favour or collude with (Rogerson) in relation to the fabrication of the case” (at T4062 L1 to 4).
	
	
	It was Mr Wendler's submission that in all of the circumstances such re-examination impugned Rogerson's character which was raised by the cross-examination, and that accordingly it ought be permitted.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that viewed properly, Rogerson's character had not been raised at all. The Crown submitted that on a proper analysis of the evidence, the cross-examination was not directed to the issue of character, but was rather directed to issues relating to the nature and extent of the relationship between the two accused during the period leading up to the alleged commission of the offences.
	
	
	The Crown also submitted that, in a broader sense, the proposed re-examination did not arise from cross-examination.
	
	
	Mr Thomas, on behalf of Rogerson, generally supported the Crown’s position. He emphasised that the cross-examination which was said to have raised Rogerson’s character was to be viewed in its proper context. He pointed, in particular, to the opening address of counsel who then appeared for McNamara, who told the jury (at T69 L44) that the evidence would be that the two accused had met at a book launch. Mr Thomas explained that this assertion was always a matter of contention as far as Rogerson was concerned. He submitted that the cross-examination was directed towards establishing the fact that, contrary to what was asserted in the opening address, by the time of the book launch there already existed a friendship between the two accused.
	
	
	Mr Thomas submitted that in these circumstances character had not been raised and that accordingly, the basis upon which the proposed re-examination was sought to be pursued had not been made out. He too submitted that the proposed re-examination did not properly arise out of the cross-examination of McNamara in any event.
	
	
	Section 110 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (“the Act”) is in the following terms:
	


Evidence about character of accused persons

(1)  The hearsay rule, the opinion rule, the tendency rule and the credibility rule do not apply to evidence adduced by a defendant to prove (directly or by implication) that the defendant is, either generally or in a particular respect, a person of good character.

(2)  If evidence adduced to prove (directly or by implication) that a defendant is generally a person of good character has been admitted, the hearsay rule, the opinion rule, the tendency rule and the credibility rule do not apply to evidence adduced to prove (directly or by implication) that the defendant is not generally a person of good character.

(3)  If evidence adduced to prove (directly or by implication) that a defendant is a person of good character in a particular respect has been admitted, the hearsay rule, the opinion rule, the tendency rule and the credibility rule do not apply to evidence adduced to prove (directly or by implication) that the defendant is not a person of good character in that respect.


	
	For present purposes, given the issue that has been raised, the operative provision is s. 110(2). The principal issue is whether or not what was put by Mr Thomas in cross-examination amounted to adducing evidence in order to prove, either directly or by implication, that Rogerson was generally a person of good character.
	
	
	The expression ""adducing evidence"" refers to leading evidence, be it in evidence-in-chief or cross-examination:  Gabriel v R (1997) 76 FCR 279 at 297 (per Higgins J (as his Honour then was) Gallop and Mathews JJ agreeing). The phrase ""adduced to prove"" as it is used in s. 110 requires that the evidence be adduced with a subjective intention of proving good character: Gabriel (supra) at 297; R v Bartle [2003] NSWCCA 329.
	
	
	In R v El-Kheir [2004] NSWCCA 461 Tobias JA at [50], in reference to Bartle (supra), observed that in order for evidence of good character to be ""adduced"" within the meaning of s. 110 there must be some proof of an intention, in the sense of a conscious decision, to raise the issue. Similar observations were made by Barr J in PGM v R [2006] NSWCCA 310 at [35]. In Bartle the Court deliberately refrained (at [146]) from exploring the issue of how, in a particular case, such subjective intention might be established.
	
	
	In my view, when the evidence in the present case is read as a whole, it unequivocally points the cross-examination having been directed to the issue of the nature and extent of the relationship between the two accused, rather than being a conscious and deliberate attempt to raise the issue of Rogerson's character. Given that the proposed re-examination rested upon a conclusion that Rogerson’s character had been raised, it should not be permitted.
	
	
	In view of the conclusion that I have reached, it is strictly not necessary for me to consider whether the evidence sought to be adduced could be said to arise out of cross-examination in any broader sense. However, it should be noted that s. 39 of the Act, which relates to re-examination, has been interpreted as containing a limitation that there must be some ambiguity or distortion in evidence given in cross-examination to justify re-examination.
	
	
	In Hadid v Australis Media Limited (No 14) (NSWSC 5 November 1996, unreported) Sperling J made a number of observations in respect of the position at common law as to re-examination, when compared with the position under s. 39 of the Act. His Honour observed that at common law the purpose of re-examination was not merely to remove ambiguities and uncertainties, but was allowed wherever an answer in cross-examination would, unless supplemented or explained, leave the Court with an impression which was capable of being construed unfavourably to the party calling the witness, and which represented a distortion, or incomplete account, of the truth as the witness was able to present it. His Honour went on to pose (but not resolve) the question of whether or not the terms of s. 39 of the Act were more liberal than the common law.
	
	
	These are issues I do not have to decide in the present case, in light of the primary conclusion I have reached. However, I should observe that in my view it could not be said that the evidence, as it was left in cross-examination, amounted to a distortion or incomplete account of the truth as far as McNamara was able to present it. In my view, there was no ambiguity at all arising from anything that he said in respect of this issue, although I reiterate that this is not a matter that I have to determine.
	
	
	It was for those reasons that I determined that the proposed re-examination should not be permitted.

		15 June 2016",2016-05-05 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2241291,R v Jafary [2016] NSWDC 41,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: The learned Crown Prosecutor drew to my attention a fact of which I was not aware, as I did not have access to the officer-in-charge’s statement, that the accused at one point of the investigation of this matter was administered what is called a “special caution” to represent the effect of s 89A Evidence Act 1995 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Act’). Section 89A of the Act was introduced into the New South Wales Act by the Evidence Amendment (Evidence of Silence) Bill (‘the Bill’) 2013. It is a provision about which at this point, as far as I am aware, there is very little case law. The most recent edition of Odgers (Uniform Evidence Law (11ed)) has no reference to cases, although it does have some commentary.
	
	
	The situation is that the accused was initially spoken to by police in relation to this matter as I understand it from the evidence on 13 January 2014. On that occasion he was told by the officer that he did not have to say anything unless he wishes, that whatever he did say would be recorded and may be used in evidence, a caution that he understood. I point out that the accused from what I understand of the matter has English as a second language but there is no issue that he does not understand English.
	
	
	Police revisited the accused on 2 June 2014. He was told that the police wish to interview him electronically. He was asked, “Will you be interviewed today?” He answered, “No.” I point out at this particular point of the matter, as I understood the statement which I have just received, the accused was in the presence of a legal representative, Ms Gibbons. He was asked these questions: “Will you participate in an electronically recorded interview to officially decline being interviewed about this matter today?” He did not respond but his legal representative advised the officer that her client did not have to answer. The next thing that he was told was:
	


“Samad, you are not obliged to say or do anything unless you wish to do so, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something you later rely on in court. Anything you do say and do may be given in evidence. Do you understand?”


	
	The accused did not respond. He was later approached in the custody room and the officer said:
	


“Samad, after being given the special caution in the presence of your lawyer Ms Gibbons and being given time to privately speak with her, would you like to provide an interview about the alleged sexual assault of Brittany Aldred?”


	
	The accused replied “No,” and shook his head. The conversation was apparently recorded in a notebook.
	
	
	The Crown has raised the matter, quite properly, for discussion in the absence of the jury, as I would understand it for a couple of reasons. One is to address the issue of whether evidence should be led from the officer of the administering of the special caution. As well, as I would understand the matter, in anticipation of issues that may or may not be raised with the accused if he gave evidence in relation to the matter.
	
	
	My understanding of the learned Crown Prosecutor’s submission, although he did not refer to any particular authority but referred me to the Second Reading speech of the Attorney General as to the Bill, was that there may be inferences that could be drawn adversely to the accused from exercising his right to silence in the circumstances I have outlined.
	
	
	Section 89A(1) provides:
	


“In a criminal proceeding for a serious indictable offence such unfavourable inferences may be drawn as appear proper from evidence that during official questioning in relation to the offence, the defendant failed or refused to mention a fact:


	
	that the defendant could reasonably have been expected to mention in the circumstances existing at the time, and
	
	
	that is relied on in his or her defence in that proceeding.” (emphasis added).
	



	
	This particular subsection does not apply unless certain conditions are met (See s 89A(2)). I have heard no argument about this but prima facie it would appear from my understanding of s 89A(2) of the Act that the relevant conditions were met in this particular instance.
	
	
	The first observation to make is that the accused declined to be interviewed and, thus, there was no relevant “official questioning” in relation to the offence other than the administering of the special caution and questions as to whether he wanted to be questioned and whether he understood the caution.
	
	
	One must wonder if an inference was to be drawn, what inference could be drawn from the fact that a person is cautioned and told that they in fact have the right to remain silent if they wish then the person notes the caution without any particular proposition to comment upon. There could be no relevant matter, in the context of the particular questions asked, that the accused could reasonably have been expected to mention in the circumstances existing at the time that may be relied upon in his defence in the proceedings.
	
	
	In my view the terms of s 89A are not engaged because in the context of what questions asked, it could not be seen to be “official questioning” such as to reasonably elicit an answer within the knowledge of the accused that he could reasonably give at the relevant time.
	
	
	The Crown very helpfully provided me with a copy of the Second Reading speech. The view I have formed in relation to the operation of s 89A seems to be confirmed by the terms of the then Attorney General’s comments in the Second Reading speech. I am fully aware of the general terms of the statutory construction in the Second Reading speech as an aid to the interpretation of legislation, particularly in the context of any ambiguity. However, it is also a fundamental tenet of the statutory construction that when the words in the statute are plain one would ordinarily expect that the assistance from the Second Reading speech would not be so great.
	
	
	This is what the learned Attorney General said inter alia in the Second Reading speech:
	


“I say it is simply a matter of common sense that a jury should be allowed to consider drawing an unfavourable inference against such a defendant who relies on something at trial the defendant could have mentioned during questioning, subject to certain safeguards. The Bill represents a targeted and balanced response to community concerns and it has been the subject of considerable community, police and government concern. Before I turn to the detail of the Evidence Amendment (Evidence of Silence) Bill, I thank all the individuals and organisations who provided submissions in response to the government’s exposure draft Bill.

As a result of the submissions received changes have been made in the Bill to reflect a number of issues raised, in particular the Bill provides more detail regarding what amounts to an opportunity to consult an Australian legal practitioner. It also redefines those persons who are exempt from provisions by reason of their inability to understand the consequences of failing or refusing to mention a fact later relied on at trial.”


	
	Turning to the main “detail of the Bill” he stated that the then Bill as it was presented to Parliament provides that:
	


“ … the general prohibition on drawing an unfavourable inference in relation to silence is subject to proposed new s 89A. This new section allows an unfavourable inference to be drawn against certain defendants ... s 89A which sets out the circumstances in which an unfavourable inference may be drawn against the defendant in criminal proceedings for a serious indictable offence and the threshold criteria which must be met ... under the provisions of this Bill an unfavourable inference may be drawn in relation to the failure or refusal to mention a fact during official questioning. It does not require the failure or refusal to be in respect of the specific question or representation from the investigating official”.

“This will prevent a defendant from using silence to hide behind the absence of a particular question or representation being put to elicit the fact later relied on. This Bill focuses on the defendant being given an opportunity to explain what happened when spoken to by police, the onus placed on the defendant to mention all relevant facts is balanced by the safeguard that it must have been reasonable to mention the fact during questioning. If it is reasonable for it to be mentioned then the defendant should not be permitted to rely on the absence of a particular question being asked in the interview to excuse the failure to mention the information”. (emphasis added)


	
	Later in the Parliamentary speeches in response to other speakers the Attorney General said:
	


“(The Bill) makes amendments to the Evidence Act to allow unfavourable inferences to be drawn against accused persons who seek to rely on facts at trial that were not mentioned during the questioning of police “ ... (the) special caution … explains to the suspect possible consequences of failing or refusing to mention a fact that is later relied on” (emphasis added).


	
	Quite clearly by reference to the terms of what the learned Attorney General said in the course of the Second Reading speech and his other comments, the issue of drawing inferences, as difficult and as complicated as it may be to determine what the relevant inference adverse to the accused, is to be seen in the light of the defendant having the opportunity in answer to official questioning to make a particular representation that would disclose a fact or not, by the exercise of silence, that could reasonably be expected to be within the suspect’s knowledge at the time of the relevant questioning.
	
	
	I do not propose to go into the discussion in the text of Mr Odgers SC concerning aspects of the matter arising from other terms of the legislation. But in my view having regard to the terms of the section there was no relevant “official questioning” here in respect of which the accused’s “silence”, which was a refusal to be interviewed, could operate to engage the relevant provision.
	
	
	If I was in error in relation to that interpretation of s 89A as it applies here, in the context of no specific questions being asked of the accused in relation to relevant matters concerning the charge brought against the accused, it would seem that no “unfavourable inference could be drawn as would appear proper from the evidence”. It seems inconceivable, in the context of the nature of a special caution being administered to the accused, that the accused could have in those circumstances, “failed or refused to mention a fact” that he could reasonably have been expected to do in the circumstances existing at that time. One could hardly conceive of any reasonable “fact” that might be raised at the time of a special caution being administered indicating an unwillingness to be interviewed, other than perhaps saying the words, “I am not guilty”, or “I deny any wrongdoing” or words to that effect, which are so general in themselves as to not establish any particular “fact” other than the accused denied his guilt. A refusal to be interviewed consistent with a suspect’s “right” not be interviewed usually allows no opportunity to mention a “fact” or facts that may be relied upon at a later time.
	
	
	It follows that I cannot see in this matter, either by consideration of the expression “official questioning” or of what might be “reasonable” to draw from the accused’s unwillingness to be interviewed, having been told that he did not have to participate in an interview, any matter that would constitute an unfavourable inference.
	
	
	It is to be fairly said that these are matters in due course that will be considered by superior courts to my court, such as the Court of Criminal Appeal or the High Court. But I point out that the right to silence still exists as a ‘right’ and s 89A does not abrogate the right to silence entirely. It clearly provides a situation which the legislature saw as a sensible “compromise”, in the context of the debate that the Attorney General referred to, where a person participating in official questioning cannot hide behind the fact of an exercise of silence in the course of that questioning, or failure to disclose a particular fact later disclosed in the conduct of subsequent proceedings. Of course, as the learned author Stephen Odgers SC points out, what particular inference(s) may be drawn will be a matter of debate in each particular case where the issue arises.

		06 April 2016",2016-03-20 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2241309,R v Michael Basanovic; R v Wade Basanovic [2016] NSWSC 292,"Judgment


	
	Just before 4pm on Tuesday, 15 January 2013 the deceased Zeljko Mitrovic was shot and killed in the upstairs office of his company known as Dynamic Transport at 138 Hassell Street, Wetherill Park. At the same time an employee of the deceased, Michael Bell, was shot in the right arm and suffered a fracture of the lower end of the right humerus.
	
	
	Michael Basanovic, Wade Basanovic and Brian Brown were jointly indicted that each did murder the deceased and that each did cause grievous bodily harm to Michael Bell with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	The trial took place from 4 to 28 August 2015. At the conclusion of the case for Michael Basanovic and Wade Basanovic application was made by Senior Counsel for Brian Brown that I should direct the jury to acquit Mr Brown on the basis that there was no case to answer. On 25 August 2015 I acceded to that application and directed the jury to acquit Mr Brown which they duly did. A similar application was made on behalf of Michael Basanovic and that application was refused: R v Basanovic (No 5) [2015] NSWSC 1197.
	
	
	The jury returned their verdicts on 31 August 2015. In respect of Michael Basanovic they found him guilty of the murder of the deceased and guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to Michael Bell. In respect of Wade Basanovic they found him not guilty of the murder of the deceased but guilty of manslaughter. In addition, they found him guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to Michael Bell. They now stand for sentence in relation to those verdicts.
	
	
	The maximum sentence for murder is life imprisonment. There is a standard non-parole period in this case of 20 years. The maximum penalty for manslaughter is 25 years imprisonment. There is no standard non-parole period. The maximum penalty for causing grievous bodily harm with intent to do so is 25 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 7 years.
	


The facts


	
	It is necessary for me to find facts consistent with the jury’s verdicts. That is by no means an easy task given the verdicts and the circumstances of the offending. The Crown’s case was based on a joint criminal enterprise between Michael Basanovic and Wade Basanovic to murder the deceased. The reason they intended to kill the deceased was related to the previous membership of Michael Basanovic in the Hells Angels Motorcycle Gang to which gang the deceased belonged at the time of his death, and to the souring of a relationship between Michael and the deceased who was also a member of that organisation.
	
	
	The jury’s conviction of Michael Basanovic for the murder of the deceased means that they must have accepted the Crown case of a joint criminal enterprise to kill the deceased. That is because it was Wade not Michael who shot and killed the deceased. The evidence demands that the arrangement must have been made before the offenders and Mr Brown went upstairs into the deceased’s offices as I shall relate. Yet the conviction of Wade Basanovic for manslaughter must mean that the jury considered that he acted in self-defence, albeit using excessive or unreasonable force. Although provocation was left to the jury neither the Crown nor counsel for Wade contended that the manslaughter verdict was explicable by reliance on provocation. I agree with that assessment.
	
	
	It must be said, however, that a joint criminal enterprise to kill the deceased involving the presence of the offenders and others at the premises on that day in circumstances where Wade carried a gun in his pocket to effect that enterprise sits uneasily with a conclusion that Wade alone shot the deceased as a defensive measure to protect his father.
	
	
	The background facts are relatively uncontroversial. I note that any facts I find against the offenders must be found beyond reasonable doubt but facts found in their favour may be found on the balance of probabilities.
	
	
	The deceased became a full member of the Hells Angels on 16 December 2007. At the time of his death he was a member of the Brisbane City Chapter.
	
	
	Michael Basanovic had been a member of the Bandidos Motorcycle Gang in the late 1990s. He then left the Bandidos. He became a prospect in the Hells Angels gang from July 2009 or a little earlier. He became a full Hells Angels member on 6 July 2010. He ceased being a member of the gang somewhere between November 2010 and April 2011 but probably closer to the latter date.
	
	
	Whilst he was associated with the Hells Angels he was a methamphetamine cook for the deceased. He had previously had a good relationship with the deceased but relations soured between them when the deceased started having problems with one of Michael’s mates in the Hells Angels, a man known as Shovel. The deceased questioned Michael’s loyalty because of his friendship with Shovel.
	
	
	Shovel died on 1 April 2010 and Michael said that from that time onwards he just slowed down in what he was doing for the deceased, principally cooking methamphetamine. That does not sit easily with the fact that it was some three months after Shovel’s death that Michael became a full Hells Angels’ member.
	
	
	In any event, two other things occurred that appeared to cause Michael to lose motivation particularly for the work he was supposed to be doing for the deceased. His brother was found to have cancer and died in April 2011, and a little before that time Michael had his hands operated on for carpel tunnel syndrome.
	
	
	Relations between the deceased and Michael must have deteriorated significantly because the deceased called a meeting of the Hells Angels at the Petersham clubhouse to sort things out. Michael said that this meeting was six to eight months after Shovel’s death which would place it towards the end of 2010, but at another time in his evidence he said it was in 2011. The latter time fits more easily with subsequent events. At that meeting Michael was seriously assaulted and, although he does not know who assaulted him, the deceased was close by to him before he was struck on the left hand side and Michael believed that the deceased was responsible for the assault. Wade had accompanied Michael to a hotel near the clubhouse where he waited for his father to return from the meeting. Wade observed the condition of his father immediately after the assault.
	
	
	Shortly after that time Michael decided to leave the club and he handed his colours in outside a clubhouse. At that time the deceased was present. The deceased said words to the effect that they could work things out but Michael said there was nothing to work out. As Michael walked away from the clubhouse the deceased followed him and said “You know this is going to get nasty if it is not sorted”.
	
	
	Michael gave evidence that after that time but before his brother died in April 2011 he was advised by the police that his life was in danger because there was a contract out on him. They said they could help him, but Michael rejected their offer. It was at about this time that Michael moved from Waterloo to Brighton Le Sands because Brighton Le Sands was within an area that another outlaw motorcycle gang controlled. He thought he would be safer there. Subsequently, the Hells Angels made two visits to Michael’s parents’ place, presumably looking for him or for the purposes of intimidation.
	
	
	After the second visit by the Hells Angels to his parents’ place just after New Year 2013 Michael gave evidence that he was ropeable, and he found out the deceased's Berry number and sent him a text saying ""You're a weak dog going to an old person's home who is dying of cancer at my parents' place"". He received a response from the deceased saying, ""I'm not a dog. You're the dog that's hiding. Let's catch up."" Michael responded, ""What, so I can get bashed again?"" The deceased replied, ""You know how to fix this. We can sort it out. You know what to do. You need me. Let's sort it out"". Michael responded ""I don't need you or the fucking Club. I can go elsewhere. I have changed Clubs before and I can do it again."" The deceased replied, ""You're not going anywhere. You're a dead man"". This exchange took place just after the new year 2013, probably two weeks before 15 January 2013.
	
	
	After the exchange of texts Michael said that he realised he had said the wrong thing, like putting fuel on a fire. He said he knew that the deceased was going to knock him, that is, kill him. Michael said that he decided he wanted to sort it out with the deceased and see if he could buy his way out of it by a payment of money as somebody else he knew had done.
	
	
	Whether that evidence of Michael about realising he had said the wrong thing and deciding he wanted to sort it out by paying money is true or not is difficult to determine. What seems clear, and I find, is that it was at about this time that the joint criminal enterprise to kill the deceased was hatched.
	
	
	Wade gave evidence of knowing about the bashing of his father at the Hells Angels’s clubhouse in Petersham and that his father told him that Steve (the deceased) was responsible. He gave evidence of knowing that the police told his father there was a contract out on him, of knowing about the visits of the Hells Angels to his grandparent’s house at Strathfield, and of knowing about the subsequent text message exchanges between his father and the deceased, culminating in the deceased telling his father he was dead.
	
	
	Through Mr Brown Michael met Frank Bacic who was a friend of the deceased’s. Michael spoke to Frank Bacic to get him to set up a meeting with the deceased. Michael asked Wade and Mr Brown and a few other men he knew to go with him to see the deceased. Wade told his father he wanted to go there in any event. Michael asked the others to go with him in case the deceased had his own men around him as he usually did.
	
	
	The Crown does not accept this background evidence of threats and visits on behalf of the Hells Angels and the deceased because, as the learned Crown Prosecutor quite properly said, she had no way of testing or determining whether these matters were true or not. Wade’s evidence in that regard is largely dependent upon acceptance of his father’s evidence except for his observations of his father after he was bashed at the Petersham clubhouse. His evidence about who was responsible for that bashing also comes from his father.
	
	
	Nevertheless, I accept this evidence from both Michael and Wade. Conscious as I am of how easy it is to defame the dead when they cannot respond, there was enough other evidence given at the trial for me to conclude that the deceased was a ruthless and violent man who had few, if any, scruples in dealing with those who crossed him in any way he thought appropriate. This was particularly evident from the sentencing remarks of Hidden J in relation to the deceased’s conviction for manslaughter involving two Turkish men in 2000: R v Puta & Ors [2001] NSWSC 225.
	
	
	The offenders, and their companions travelled in two cars to the deceased’s premises in Wetherill Park on the afternoon of 15 January. Wade and Frank Bacic went first to see if there was anyone else there with the deceased. If there was, Michael was not prepared to meet the deceased.
	
	
	When the car carrying Wade and Frank arrived at the premises Wade waited until Frank Bacic and the others in the car got out. He then took his father’s gun from a compartment in the front of the car and put it in his pocket. Frank Bacic went upstairs and eventually persuaded the deceased to come downstairs. The deceased had a heated conversation with Wade saying that he did not know either Wade nor his father. He then went back upstairs. Wade rang his father and told him that the deceased claimed not to know him but he said the deceased was very angry. Michael arrived at the premises with Mr Brown. Michael, Wade and Mr Brown went upstairs to speak to the deceased. The Crown submitted that the offenders knew from what Frank Bacic had told them that employees of the deceased’s company were present upstairs in the office. In any event, it would have been obvious to them when they entered the upstairs part of the offices that there were a number of employees present.
	
	
	There was a heated argument between the deceased and the three men. A viewing of the CCTV footage, which captured the whole argument visually but not aurally, then shows Wade to pull a gun from his pocket quite quickly and commence shooting. According to both Michael and Wade, just before the shooting commenced the deceased had said to them, “You’re all fucking dead”. Wade then turned to Michael and asked him if heard what the deceased said. Michael then said, “Let’s get out of here”. Mr Brown had started to leave at that point. Wade claimed that he just “lost it”, and that’s when he started shooting.
	
	
	As the deceased started staggering after he was first shot he moved around towards his own office and away from the entrance door. Wade kept shooting (five bullets were fired) and one of those hit Michael Bell. Three of the bullets struck the deceased. The fifth passed out through the wall of the premises.
	
	
	The Crown case was, and the Crown continued to submit at the sentence hearing, that Wade pulled out the gun after receiving a nod from Michael. The nod was said to be significant because it clearly demonstrated the prior arrangement for Wade to shoot the deceased. Mr Bell gave evidence that he saw Michael nod to Wade before the shooting.
	
	
	The DVD was played during the trial on a number of occasions. I have subsequently watched the DVD a number of times. I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Michael Basanovic nodded to Wade before Wade commenced shooting. I do not consider that it is necessary for the jury to have concluded that there was such a nod for the jury to have come to the view that there was a joint criminal enterprise between Michael and Wade to kill the deceased.
	
	
	The offenders and those with them then drove from the premises. The next day Wade and Mr Brown travelled on one-way tickets to Chile paid for by Michael. The principal reason for that was said to be so that they were out of the reach of the Hells Angels who might seek revenge for the deceased’s death. However, although both returned voluntarily a few months later, I consider that part of their motivation was to avoid detection for their involvement in the shooting.
	


Submissions


	
	Although counsel for each of the offenders initially submitted that I should sentence according to the facts involving each of them individually without regard to the verdict against the other, they ultimately accepted the Crown’s submission in reliance on Mariam v R; R v Mariam [2013] NSWCCA 338 that it was necessary for me to sentence having regard to all of the facts and the verdicts found notwithstanding that the task might entail “an exercise in mental gymnastics”: Mariam at [20]. That is what I have done.
	
	
	Counsel for Wade submitted that the planning and premeditation in relation to the joint criminal enterprise did not extend to the killing of the deceased. In oral submissions, this was expanded to a submission that I could not find beyond reasonable doubt that any intention to kill existed prior to the offenders being present in the offices with the deceased. Similarly, counsel for Michael submitted that if there was any intention it was only an intention to go there to talk to try to sort the matter out but that if it could not be sorted out an intention to kill might arise. I reject these submissions.
	
	
	If I had found that Michael nodded to Wade immediately before the shooting that would have necessitated a finding that there was a plan already agreed that the deceased would be killed at some point when the offenders went to the premises. There was no evidence from any of the witnesses who heard what was said during the argument including the offenders that would enable a finding that the intention to kill only arose during the discussions with the deceased.
	
	
	The only finding that I can make consistent with the jury’s verdict in relation to an intention to kill the deceased is that this was agreed between Michael and Wade at or about the time Michael was endeavouring to organise a meeting with the deceased with the assistance of Frank Bacic. If there was no nod, that makes it even more likely that the intention to kill must have been agreed before the offenders went to the premises.
	
	
	To make that finding consistent with the verdict of manslaughter by reason of excessive self-defence on Wade’s part I find that although there was a joint criminal enterprise between the offenders to kill the deceased, Wade’s intention of doing so was to protect his father because of his belief about the danger that his father was facing arising from the bashing, the visits by the Hells Angels to his grandparents, from his belief that the deceased had a contract out on his father’s life and because of his knowledge of the violence of the deceased. Although Michael was no doubt concerned for his own safety, the only finding I can make consistent with the jury’s verdict of murder in respect of him is that he intended to kill the deceased not so much because of a belief that he needed to defend himself as much as a revenge for what he had suffered at the deceased‘s hands. I accept, however, that it is difficult to reconcile that evidence with Michael’s evidence, which I accept, that he could have killed the deceased in far more discreet circumstances if that was his intention, particularly because he knew where the deceased lived in a somewhat remote location.
	


Michael Basanovic

Objective seriousness

   Murder


	
	The Crown does not contend that the murder was in the worst category. I agree with that assessment.
	
	
	It is clear that Michael Basanovic was the moving party in arranging for the meeting with the deceased where he was killed. It was his weapon that was used and I find that he knew that Wade would take that weapon to the meeting with the deceased.
	
	
	Matters of aggravation are that the killing was part of a planned criminal activity and a weapon was used. When the weapon is a firearm that necessarily means that the offence was committed without regard for the public safety of the other employees. Those two aggravating factors in s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) should not be double counted. I have already found that the intention was to kill the deceased and not to inflict grievous bodily harm on him.
	
	
	I accept the submission made on behalf of Michael that self-defence played some small role in the arrangement he made to kill the deceased although this self-defence did not rise to the level of a defence to the charge of murder. I rely in that regard on what was said by Lee J in R v Bell (1985) 2 NSWLR 466 at 485 and by Hoeben J (as his Honour then was) in R v Heffernan [2005] NSWSC 739 at [53]-[54].
	
	
	Were it not for the element of self-defence that I have determined was some part of the motivation for the killing I would have found that this offence was in the mid-range of objective seriousness. I consider that the self-defence aspect means that the matter should be regarded as a little below the mid-range of objective seriousness.
	


   Cause grievous bodily harm


	
	I consider this when dealing with Wade. What is there said applies equally to Michael because of the joint criminal enterprise. Although his role was not that of the shooter, the circumstances of the shooting at the deceased’s premises with innocent people present mean that the objective seriousness of the offending is the same for Michael as for Wade.
	


Subjective features


	
	Michael Basanovic was born on 14 October 1965. At the time of the killing he was aged 47 years. He is now aged 50. The offender was born in Bosnia and came to Australia when aged five or six years. When he left school he took up an apprenticeship in automotive engineering, fitting, machining, turning, specialising in motors. He became an interstate truck driver. He suffered a serious motor vehicle accident in 1990 when driving a heavy vehicle and the front steering gave way. He woke up four days later in hospital. He said that he suffered frontal lobe brain damage, damage to his teeth and injury to both his cervical and lumbar spine. There was no suggestion that the frontal lobe brain damage he suffered had any relationship to the killing or any other matters about which evidence was given at the trial. Although Wade told Dr Olav Nielssen that his father subsequently developed bipolar disorder there is no evidence of that.
	
	
	Michael joined the Black Uhlans Motorcycle Club when aged about 17. Subsequently he hung around with the Comancheros and then the Bandidos. He left the Bandidos on good terms and then in 2009 he commenced his involvement with the Hells Angels. He was first a prospect and then became a member of that Club. He became close to the deceased and worked for him as a meth cook. The circumstances in which he left the Hells Angels were noted earlier.
	
	
	The offender has a number of convictions on his record. These include firearms and drug offences. On 17 May 2007 he was given a two year prison sentence with an 18 month non-parole period for maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm. On appeal the non-parole period was reduced to 12 months but the overall sentence was maintained.
	
	
	On 18 May 2011 he was given a two year section 9 bond for obtaining money by deception. He remained on that bond at the time of the present offences. That is an aggravating factor.
	
	
	No evidence of any sort was put forward for Michael at the sentencing hearing.
	


Wade Basanovic

Objective seriousness

   Manslaughter


	
	Although the jury found a verdict of manslaughter because of unreasonable force used by Wade in defence of his father the offence was a serious one. It had been planned for a few days and involved the use of a firearm. The offence was not committed in the heat of the moment and firing five bullets towards the deceased was excessive self-defence to a marked degree. The deceased was unarmed and had no support in the way the offenders did in taking other men with them to the confrontation. The objective seriousness of the unlawful killing is not mitigated by the fact that the murder charge was reduced to manslaughter because of excessive self-defence. As R A Hulme J said (Macfarlan JA and R S Hulme AJ agreeing) in Goundar v R [2012] NSWCCA 87 at [42], it is not the variety or legal basis of manslaughter but the facts which determine the objective gravity in a particular case.
	
	
	The planning and the use of the firearm were aggravating factors. I note what I said earlier about the impact on public safety of the use of the firearm. Not only was there no regard for public safety but firing a gun at a moving target where other people are present involved a grave risk of death to those persons. Although that risk almost came home to one such person, Michael Bell, and the offender will be punished for that, a number of other persons were equally at risk.
	
	
	I consider that the objective seriousness of the offending is on the upper end of the mid-range.
	


   Cause grievous bodily harm


	
	The intent involved in this offence is transferred intent. However, the offender’s intent when he shot Michael Bell was to kill the deceased. In AM v R [2012] NSWCCA 203 Johnson J reviewed the considerations relevant to the determination of the objective gravity of an offence contrary to s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Two matters relevant to the present offending are (a) the extent of the injuries sustained by the victim, a matter of great significance in assessing the objective gravity (AM at [71]), and (b) the fact that the offence was committed against an innocent citizen going about his ordinary business makes it a crime of increased seriousness (AM at [74]).
	
	
	Mr Bell was struck by the bullet in the right arm near the bicep muscle. Over a period of time he has undergone four operations on his arm. He has been left in the position where he cannot straighten his arm. The surgeon who treated Mr Bell at Liverpool Hospital gave evidence that the x-ray taken of Mr Bell’s arm showed some fractures in his humerus with multiple metallic fragments in that region and multiple pieces of shrapnel in the adjacent soft tissue. There was some swelling around the main artery in his arm and he suffered an injury to the median nerve. One of the veins that accompanies the brachial artery in the arm was also damaged by being cut through. The injuries were described by the doctor as serious injuries. He said the median nerve is an important nerve both for sensation and motor control in the thumb, the index finger, the middle finger and part of the ring finger. It also controls muscles that flex the fingers and the wrist.
	
	
	Quite apart from the physical damage sustained by Mr Bell was the emotional and psychological damage he experienced. His Victim Impact Statement eloquently detailed those matters. Mr Bell has not worked since the shooting.
	
	
	I accept that suffering grievous bodily harm is an element of the offence. However, the extent and the permanent nature of the injuries here should be regarded as informing the objective seriousness of the offending.
	
	
	I also take into account the reckless disregard which the offender showed by continuing to fire at the deceased as he staggered around after he was struck by the first bullet. I am conscious, however, that this matter should not be double counted with the aggravating feature that the unlawful killing of the deceased took place in circumstances of the grave risk of death to other persons.
	
	
	In my opinion, the offence falls within the mid-range of objective seriousness.
	


Subjective matters


	
	The offender was born on 5 July 1991. He was aged 21 at the time of the killing and is now aged 24. He was first convicted of an offence at the age of 16 years of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He was placed on a 12 month s 33(1)(B) bond. However, he was called up on that bond and a control order of nine months was imposed. On appeal to the District Court the control order was reduced to three months. The occasion for the call up appears to have been the charging of him and his conviction for recklessly causing grievous bodily harm for which he was sentenced to a control order comprising a non-parole period of eight months with a balance of term of ten months. On appeal that was reduced to a non-parole period of three months with a balance of term of nine months.
	
	
	As an adult he was convicted of possessing or attempting to possess an anabolic or androgenic steroidal agent.
	
	
	Although the offences of personal violence were committed whilst he was a minor they were serious offences and were committed only a few years before the present offences. I regard his record as an aggravating factor for the offending.
	
	
	The offender was examined by Dr Olav Nielssen on 14 October 2015. What he told Dr Nielssen indicates that he does not accept the jury’s verdict that there was a joint criminal enterprise to kill the deceased. He maintained, as he did in his evidence, that they only went there to talk to the deceased. That indicates a lack of remorse for the killing.
	
	
	The offender disclosed no drug or alcohol problem and he said he was not affected by drugs or alcohol at the time of the offending. As far as his general health is concerned, he told Dr Nielssen that he suffered from migraine headaches, joint pain in the right shoulder and gastric reflux. The only other health issue he described, apart from reconstruction surgery to his right shoulder from having played football as a teenager, was a diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome at about the ages of 14 and 15. He was apparently prescribed certain drugs which appear to have corrected the problem. He did not claim to be depressed.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen said the offender was not thought to meet the accepted criteria for the diagnosis of any psychiatric disorder. Dr Nielssen thought he had a good prognosis and good prospects for rehabilitation.
	
	
	Two references were provided, one from his older sister and one from his mother. His mother, in particular, spoke of Wade being a caring, respectful and polite son and grandson. Both spoke of concern for their safety and well-being, and his mother said that the offender had asked that neither she nor his sister attend Court because he feared for their safety due to the fact that an outlaw bike club was involved. That sat uneasily with what the offender told Dr Nielssen that he was not aware of any threats or danger from the deceased’s family or the Hells Angels Club, as the problem was one between the deceased and his father and not between him and the Club.
	


Remorse


	
	I have already mentioned Wade’s statement to Dr Nielssen that he and the others only went to talk to the deceased. Whilst, given the history of bad blood between the deceased and Michael it is understandable, although not really excusable, that no remorse has been expressed for the deceased’s death, what is to be deplored is that at no stage either at the trial or subsequently has either Michael or Wade expressed any remorse or regret for what happened to Michael Bell, an entirely innocent person caught in the cross-fire. Nor can the lack of remorse be explained by a refusal to accept the jury’s verdict. Both of them know without a doubt that Wade shot Michael Bell and seriously and permanently injured him. I regard this lack of remorse as significant.
	


Deterrence


	
	Both specific and general deterrence have some significance in the present case. As far as both offenders are concerned their history of violent offences requires the sentence to contain a component for specific deterrence.
	
	
	General deterrence is of more significance where, as here, the offenders decided to take the law into their own hands to deal with a situation which ought to have involved law enforcement authorities. On Michael’s own evidence the police not only warned him about the threat to his life but offered to assist him. That offer was rebuffed and Michael chose to resolve the problem by killing the deceased. Whilst that may be the way members of outlaw motorcycle gangs resolve their problems it is necessary for this Court to denounce such behaviour and to make it clear that those who do so will be severely punished particularly where, as here, an innocent person has additionally been seriously injured.
	


Rehabilitation and re-offending


	
	I have nothing to assist me in relation to these matters as far as Michael Basanovic is concerned. Dr Nielssen thought that Wade had a good prognosis and good prospects for rehabilitation.
	
	
	Nothing has been put forward to suggest that special circumstances should be found for Michael Basanovic. In Wade’s case the matters suggested as special circumstances are the offender’s youth, his prospects of rehabilitation and the fact that it will be his first time in adult custody. Given his criminal history I do not consider that Wade being aged 21 at the time of the killing warrants any consideration as a special circumstance. If, as Dr Nielssen believes, Wade has good prospects of rehabilitation, I do not consider there should be any shortening of the non-parole period to allow for a longer period on parole to achieve rehabilitation. In any event, the length of the parole period will provide quite sufficient time for rehabilitation. The Court of Criminal Appeal has said more than once that it is not a special circumstance that it will be an offender’s first time in custody, let alone adult custody. However, because of the accumulation of sentences for Wade I find special circumstances in relation to the manslaughter sentence simply to bring about the statutory ratio on the overall sentence. Similarly, I find special circumstances for Michael in relation to the sentence for murder to bring about the approximate statutory ratio on the overall sentence.
	


Sentence


	
	Wade Basanovic was arrested on 4 May 2013 and has been in custody since that date. His sentence will commence on that date. Michael Basanovic was arrested on 8 May 2013 and has been in custody since that time. His sentence will commence on that date.
	
	
	Both offences occurred as part of the same criminality. Although the elements of the second count were established, there was one single intent on the offenders’ part, that is, to kill the deceased. To some extent, therefore, the criminality involved in the killing comprehends the wounding. By reason of the recklessness with which the killing was carried out and the seriousness of the injuries to Michael Bell, there must be some accumulation of the sentences for each offence.
	
	
	Michael Basanovic, for causing grievous bodily harm to Michael Bell with intent to cause grievous bodily harm I convict you and sentence you to a non-parole period of seven years commencing 8 May 2013 and expiring 7 May 2020 with an additional term of two years and four months expiring 7 September 2022. For the murder of Zeljko Mitrovic I convict you and sentence you to a non-parole period of 18 years commencing 8 May 2016 and expiring 7 May 2034 with an additional term of six years and nine months expiring 7 February 2041. The overall sentence is a non-parole period of 21 years with an additional term of six years and nine months.
	
	
	Wade Basanovic, for causing grievous bodily harm to Michael Bell with intent to cause grievous bodily harm I convict you and sentence you to a non-parole period of seven years commencing 4 May 2013 and expiring 3 May 2020 with an additional term of two years and four months expiring 3 September 2022. For the manslaughter of Zeljko Mitrovic I convict you and sentence you to a non-parole period of eight years commencing 4 May 2016 and expiring 3 May 2024 with an additional term of three years and six months expiring 3 November 2027. The overall sentence is a non-parole period of 11 years with an additional term of three years and six months.

2241408,Abdallah v R [2016] NSWCCA 34,"Judgment


	
	THE COURT: On 4 January 2012 a physical altercation occurred between the appellant and three other men in the Sydney suburb of Sans Souci. At some point during that altercation, the appellant retrieved a .32 calibre self-loading pistol from under the driver’s seat of his vehicle and fired six shots at one of the men, Neal Todorovski, killing him. Three of those shots were fired at or close to point blank range into Mr Todorovski’s head or neck, and two other shots were fired into his back. In the course of chasing another of the men, the appellant fired one further shot. There was an issue at trial as to the timing of the six shots (specifically whether there were two incidents of the appellant shooting at Mr Todorovski, which were separated by the chase) and as to the sequence in which the shots were fired into Mr Todorovski. The appellant did not otherwise deny the fact of the shooting. He claimed that he discharged the shots in self-defence and, in the case of the second man, that he did not intend to shoot him. There was also an issue of provocation in relation to the shooting of Mr Todorovski (who we will refer to as the deceased).
	
	
	Following a trial before Campbell J and a jury of twelve, the appellant was convicted, on 17 March 2014, of murder contrary to s 18(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). He was acquitted on the count of shooting the other man with intent to murder, contrary to s 29 of that Act. On 20 June 2014 the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for 26 years and 8 months, with a non-parole period of 20 years. That non-parole period expires on 11 January 2032.
	
	
	The appellant appeals against his conviction. He also seeks leave to appeal against his sentence. To assist an understanding of the grounds upon which he relies, we propose to set out an outline of the factual background (as described in the appellant’s case), the issues as they arose in the trial and the significant evidence which addressed those issues. It will then be necessary to return to some of those factual issues in more detail, in the course of addressing the conviction appeal.
	


Factual background


	
	The appellant and the deceased first met at a gym in Rockdale. By January 2012 they had known each other for a couple of years. The deceased was known by the appellant to be a high ranking member of the Lone Wolves Motorcycle Club. The appellant described the deceased as someone who would use violence against people with whom he had perceived grievances (tcpt 07/03/14, pp 960, 962).
	
	
	Around December 2011, the appellant heard rumours that he owed money to the deceased. Knowing those rumours to be untrue, he unsuccessfully attempted to contact the deceased by phone. At that time, his girlfriend and the deceased’s girlfriend knew each other socially. The appellant decided to contact the deceased’s girlfriend, Aissha, to confirm the deceased’s telephone number. In the course of attempting to do so, he mistakenly sent a text message to the deceased which said: “send me Aissha’s number now”.
	
	
	The deceased took offence. On 12 December 2011, at the deceased’s request, the appellant went to his apartment building on Selmon Street in Sans Souci. The appellant’s evidence was that when he arrived the deceased immediately acted in an aggressive manner, threatened to kill him and punched him in the face (tcpt 07/03/14, pp 964-965). The appellant retaliated. He kicked the deceased in the head causing the fracture of facial bones.
	
	
	The appellant feared that the deceased would seek to “get some payback, get some revenge on” him (tcpt 07/03/14, p 966). On 13 December, a car similar to that owned by the appellant, was shot at in the local area. The appellant believed these events showed that “if [the deceased] saw [him] in the area that [he] would be shot” (tcpt 07/03/14, p 969). At this time, and despite having never owned or used a gun before, the appellant obtained a handgun from a friend, who showed him how to use it. He put the gun under the driver’s seat of his car (tcpt 07/03/14, pp 969-970).
	
	
	The appellant continued to hear reports that the deceased was “after him”. He spent the evening of 3 January 2012 at his girlfriend’s house. She told him that she had been shown a gun by the deceased, who described it as being “for your boyfriend, Tarek” (tcpt 07/03/14, p 971).
	
	
	On 4 January 2012, the appellant decided to talk to the deceased “face-to-face and fix it before it got any further” (tcpt 07/03/14, p 972). He tried to ring the deceased and instead had a conversation with Aissha who told him that the deceased was “pissed off” and had consumed drugs the night before (tcpt 07/03/14, pp 972-973). Nevertheless an arrangement was made for the appellant and deceased to meet at the deceased’s apartment on Selmon Street.
	
	
	That street runs in an east-west direction. The appellant double-parked his car outside the apartment building which was on the northern side of Selmon Street, between Rocky Point Road and Campbell Street, and waited for the deceased to come downstairs. The deceased and two other men, Matthew Lewis and John Leger, came out of the building and walked towards the appellant as he was standing at the front of his vehicle to the right of the off-side headlight and in front of the partly opened driver’s side door (tcpt 07/03/14, pp 1031-1032). The appellant observed that the deceased was holding a gun in his hand which was beside his leg. He later saw the deceased place that gun in his right pocket. Mr Lewis was carrying a knife and Mr Leger also had something in his hand (tcpt 07/03/14, pp 974-975).
	
	
	The three men surrounded the appellant. Mr Leger struck the appellant to the right side of his head (tcpt 07/03/14, p 1034). The appellant gave the following evidence as to what then happened (tcpt 07/03/14, p 976):
	


A.   I fell to the ground and covered myself, covered my head and I started to get kicked and punched. I felt myself getting pulled. And then I heard two, I don’t know if, who it was, they were saying, “shoot him, shoot him”. Then the kicking stopped. I looked up at [the deceased]. He said to me, “You’re fucking dead”, and I saw him reach into his pocket. I didn’t see him actually put his hand into his pocket. It looked like he was going [for] his pocket.

Q.   What did you do?

A.   I tried to get back up. I semi crawled to the driver’s side door, pulled it open and I got the gun out of the driver’s seat.

…

Q.   Then what did you do?

A.   I got the gun out and I come around the front door. And I was at the front, near the front headlight, and I extended my arm out and I started to shoot [the deceased].

Q.   Where did you start to shoot him, what part of his body?

A.   His head.

Q.   How close had the gun been?

A.   It was very close.


	
	The appellant did not remember how many times he shot the deceased. He said he did not stop shooting until the deceased stumbled back and fell down. The other two men fled. The appellant then chased Mr Leger to the side of and behind the apartment building. He fired a shot in the direction of Mr Leger and said that he did so only to scare him off. The deceased was shot six times in total. (As we have noted above, there was a significant dispute as to the timing and sequence of those shots.)
	
	
	The appellant left the scene of the shooting in his car. Because the deceased was lying in front of the car, the appellant initially had to reverse and then drive around his body. He arranged for the man who had supplied the gun to him to dispose of the car, which had the gun and his mobile phone in its glove box. The appellant flew to Perth on that same day. He was later arrested in Western Australia on 12 January 2012.
	


Summary of the issues at trial


	
	The Crown case was that the appellant had shot the deceased six times, including three shots fired at close range to the head and neck, and that those circumstances weighed against the appellant’s claim of self-defence. One question in the appeal is whether the Crown in opening and conducting its case adopted a particular position as to the timing and sequence of the six shots and, if so, whether the Crown sought and was allowed to depart from that earlier position in a way which gave rise to a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	In the Crown Case Statement, it was said that the appellant had shot the deceased in the back and then shot him in the head as he lay on the roadway, before commencing to chase Mr Leger. In its opening address, the Crown described the appellant as firing “a succession of shots” and formulated the “important” question for the jury’s consideration “during the course of these proceedings” as being the appellant’s “state of mind when he let fly this volley of shots from his weapon” (tcpt 19/02/14, p 44). The evidence that it was anticipated the jury would hear was described as including “… that the three men ran, they ran for their life. He fired and shot Mr Todorovski in the back and Mr Todorovski fell. He was a dead man. Having fired at him, striking him, falling him, he walked ten paces shot three shells in his skull, killing him” (tcpt 19/02/14, p 49).
	
	
	In his opening address, senior counsel for the appellant identified “the” issue for the jury in relation to the murder charge as that of “self-defence”, and specifically whether the Crown could discharge its onus by disproving that the appellant had fired “a volley of shots” because he thought he was going to die (tcpt 19/02/14, pp 57-59). He described the appellant’s case in relation to the timing and sequence of the shootings:
	


Mr Abdallah did not shoot this man when he was on the ground. He did not shoot him when he was on the ground. He fired six shots in straight succession at him, in very close range when he grabbed the gun and turned it around to attack, defend himself against the attacker, from Mr Todoroski and these other men. And then Leger takes off, Leger and Lewis take off.


	
	In concluding, he again emphasised: (tcpt 19/02/14, p 61)
	


It seems that the Crown and the defence are very close together in some respects, leaving [aside] what side of the car that the gun was taken from, by Mr Abdallah. My learned friend said a number of times there was a volley of shots. We agree, there was a volley of shots. One set of shots straight after each other when he was scared for his life. There was no shooting on the ground.


	
	The appellant accepted during cross-examination that he had brought the gun with him for his protection in contemplation that he might need it (tcpt 07/03/14, pp 1016-1017). However, in its closing address the Crown disavowed any suggestion that the appellant had brought the gun to his meeting with the deceased with an intention, from the outset, that he would use it; and this was clearly explained to the jury by a correction made during the trial judge’s summing up (tcpt 13/03/14, pp 68, 95).
	


Evidence as to the timing and sequence of shots


	
	Neither Mr Leger nor Mr Lewis gave evidence at the trial. Each refused to do so and was charged and later convicted for contempt of court. Evidence as to the timing and sequence of the shots was given by various eye witnesses, who were proximate to the events as they unfolded.
	
	
	Mr Boutsikakis was sitting in a car in Selmon Street beyond its intersection with Campbell Street. That car was parked parallel to the kerb but on the wrong side of the road and facing in a westerly direction towards the appellant’s vehicle. His evidence was that the appellant shot the deceased (who he described as a male wearing a baseball cap) once or twice “instantly” after “pulling out the gun” (which the witness described as being pointed “straight out” as the appellant extended his arm); and that he then disappeared in pursuit of Mr Leger and, upon his return, shot the deceased again as he lay on the ground (tcpt 28/02/14, pp 485-487, 511-513).
	
	
	The difficulty for the acceptance of this version of events was that it differed from the account Mr Boutsikakis had given to the police at the scene, to an officer at the station, in a video-recorded walk-through interview at the scene a month after the incident and during the committal proceedings in November 2012 (tcpt 28/02/14, pp 490, 492). That different account was that the appellant had fired the initial shots at the deceased and then taken a couple of steps over to him as he lay on the ground and immediately fired another couple of shots (tcpt 28/02/14, p 532). In cross-examination Mr Boutsikakis maintained that he was “quite clear” that there had been two separate incidents of the appellant shooting the deceased and that there was “no confusion” as to that part of his recollection (tcpt 28/02/14, p 513).
	
	
	Mr Mataipule was standing beside the bonnet of an over-heated car at the western end of Selmon Street, near Rocky Point Road, when he heard gunshots. He turned to look in the direction of the noise and saw the appellant shoot the deceased in the head and the deceased fall to the ground (tcpt 03/03/14, pp 610-611). Mr Mataipule gave evidence that the appellant then yelled “Who’s next” and chased one of the other men (tcpt 03/03/14, p 604). Contrary to the statement he gave to the police on 4 January 2012, Mr Mataipule maintained at trial (consistently with his evidence given at the committal hearing) that after that chase the appellant returned to his car without firing any further shots at the deceased (tcpt 03/03/14, pp 625, 639-640).
	
	
	Mr Leutogi was in the company of Mr Mataipule. He recalled hearing five bangs in connection with the initial shots, although he agreed it could have been six (tcpt 03/03/14, pp 660, 665). He also heard the appellant yelling words to the effect of “get the fuck back” (tcpt 03/03/14, p 650). Mr Leutogi gave evidence that, after chasing Mr Leger, the appellant returned to his vehicle, looked at something on the ground and left the scene without firing any further shots (tcpt 03/03/14, p 666).
	
	
	Mr Sua, also standing with Mr Mataipule, heard five shots and the appellant yell something like “do yous want some more” (tcpt 04/03/14, p 699). He also observed the appellant return to the vehicle without firing further shots (tcpt 04/03/14, p 700).
	
	
	Ms Alexander had parked her vehicle in Selmon Street facing in an easterly direction towards Campbell Street. The appellant’s vehicle was double-parked about four or five car spaces in front of hers. She was attempting to get her young daughter out of the car when she heard an initial bang and a succession of six to eight shots (tcpt 04/03/14, p 716). She did not see the deceased being shot and did not see a gun. She agreed that her most reliable recollection of the events was contained in her original statement, which did not mention any later gunshots (tcpt 04/03/14, pp 725-726).
	
	
	Mrs Kiel, who lived across the road from where the shooting occurred, heard a series of shots in quick succession and went to her front door to investigate. She saw the appellant at the side of the apartment building opposite. She did not hear any further gunshots after that (tcpt 04/03/14, pp 744, 748, 750).
	
	
	Mr Baker, a former Australian Federal Police officer, lived in the apartment building in Selmon Street on the western side of the building in which the deceased lived. He gave evidence that he heard five consecutive gunshots, a short pause (which in cross-examination he estimated to be less than 15 seconds) and then a sixth shot (tcpt 05/03/14, pp 794-795). He saw the appellant look at something on the ground at the front of his vehicle before driving away (tcpt 05/03/14, p 797).
	


Evidence as to the trajectory of the shots fired


	
	Two expert witnesses gave evidence in the Crown’s case in relation to the shooting of the deceased. The first was Dr Lucas Van der Walt, a scientific officer with the Forensic Ballistic Investigation Section of the New South Wales Police Force. He and another ballistics expert, Mr John Barber, who was qualified by the defence but did not give evidence, discussed and agreed on aspects of the ballistics analysis in relation to the deceased’s wounds. The second was Dr Matthew Orde, the forensic pathologist who performed the post-mortem on the deceased. He gave evidence as to the deceased’s injuries.
	
	
	The ballistics and forensic evidence could not establish the sequence of the shots in relation to the deceased’s wounds or whether the deceased was upright or in a lying position when those shots were fired (tcpt 26/02/14, p 376). Dr Orde’s evidence was that the injuries to the head and neck, and those caused by the bullet that passed through the deceased’s liver and heart (wound 6 as described at [36] below) were sustained while the deceased was alive (tcpt 27/02/14, p 451-452). He accepted that possible explanations as to the order of shots were that the deceased was shot in the back first and then in the head, having fallen with the right side of his face to the ground (tcpt 27/02/14, pp 457-458); or that he was shot in the head first and then in the back as he was turning right, away from the gun, and stumbling or collapsing to the ground (tcpt 27/02/14, pp 471-472). Dr Orde remarked of the latter sequence that “a head wound [would have] rendered him falling to the ground fairly rapidly if he were erect when the injury was sustained”.
	
	
	The bullet entry or exit wounds to the deceased’s body were numbered to aid a comprehension of the expert evidence. It is convenient to outline here the details of each wound. A computer-generated, three dimensional representation of the deceased’s body, which showed the direction of travel of the bullets, became Ex M at the trial. Copies of three images from that representation are attached to these reasons. The numbers on those images correspond with the wound numbers used below.
	
	
	Wound 1 was described as a bullet entry wound to the back of the deceased’s neck travelling from left to right (tcpt 26/02/14, p 355). The bullet that caused this wound was fired at “close proximity”, meaning from a distance of 10 to 30 centimetres (about 4 to 12 inches) (tcpt 27/02/14, pp 449-450). Wound 4 was associated with the exit of this bullet.
	
	
	Wound 2 was a bullet entry wound to the left side of the deceased’s head, above and behind the ear. The trajectory of the bullet was from left to right and back to front. This shot was said also to have been fired from a close range, meaning a distance of approximately 30 centimetres (tcpt 26/02/14, pp 374-375). Dr Orde noted the wound showed features suggestive of both close range and “also of perhaps there being a substance or material between the muzzle and the skin. Quite possibly a hat or something similar” (tcpt 27/02/14, p 438).
	
	
	Wound 3 was a second entry wound to the left side of the deceased’s head located, in this instance, in front of the ear. The relevant shot was fired when the gun was in contact or close contact with the deceased’s skin, meaning within a distance of one centimetre (tcpt 27/02/14, p 437). The bullet path was from left to right and back to front (tcpt 26/02/14, pp 357-358).
	
	
	It was not possible to determine with certainty which of Wounds 2 and 3 corresponded with the exit wound labelled Wound 8 (tcpt 26/02/14, pp 356, 359). Dr Orde expressed an opinion that Wound 8 was most likely associated with Wound 3 (tcpt 27/02/14, pp 440-441). The bullet which did not exit via Wound 8 was recovered from the deceased during autopsy.
	
	
	Wound 5 described an entry wound to the right of the deceased’s central back area. The trajectory of this bullet was from back to front and right to left (tcpt 27/02/14, pp 451, 456). The corresponding exit wound was Wound 7.
	
	
	Wound 6 was also located to the right side of the deceased’s mid-back. The bullet causing this wound travelled right to left and back to front, passing through the deceased’s heart and liver without exiting the body. In the opinion of Dr Orde, the injuries caused by this shot were sufficiently serious to kill the deceased within minutes (tcpt 27/02/14, p 452).
	
	
	Wounds 9, 10, 11 and 12 were wounds to the deceased’s left hand. Dr Orde acknowledged a possibility that these wounds were ‘defensive’, in the sense that the hand might have been raised at the time in an attempt to shield or defend the body (tcpt 27/02/14, p 465). The wounds to the deceased’s back and hand (Wounds 5, 6 and 9-12) did not show any ‘characteristics of close contact’ and were likely fired from a distance of more than 60 centimetres (tcpt 26/02/14, pp 375-376).
	
	
	Although it was accepted that the evidence could not establish the position of the deceased’s body at the time of the shooting, the defence sought to rely on the absence of evidence of any gouge marks or other similar signs of damage on the road surface as discounting the possibility that the deceased was shot from above while lying on the ground. Ms Konza, the Civilian Crime Scene Officer, gave evidence that, during her careful examination of the road surface, she found “no obvious impact marks” to suggest that a bullet had struck the road having been fired from above (tcpt 20/02/14, p 129).
	
	
	Dr Van der Walt gave evidence that if the deceased was shot by the appellant from above while he was lying on the ground, he would expect one of the bullets that exited the body to have caused a gouge mark on the road surface. Dr Orde agreed that the existence of such a mark was important in testing the hypothesis that the deceased’s injuries were inflicted while he was on the ground (tcpt 27/02/14, p 472). However, Dr Van der Walt also accepted that the shooting could have occurred that way without a mark being left and explained that there were various reasons as to why such a mark may not be caused, or may not be discovered on subsequent inspection (tcpt 26/02/14, pp 376-379). Those reasons included that the road surface in this case (which he inspected) was “fairly rough and damaged” and that a .32 calibre bullet would leave a “very small impact mark” because of its low velocity.
	


Grounds of Conviction Appeal


	
	The appellant relies on four grounds in his conviction appeal. Ground 1 is that the trial miscarried because the Crown Prosecutor was allowed to impugn, and adduce evidence contrary to, the agreement reached between the ballistics experts, Dr Van der Walt and Mr Barber.
	
	
	Ground 2 asserts that the trial miscarried because the Crown Prosecutor’s closing address misstated the law on self-defence and involved a departure from the Crown’s case as opened and conducted.
	
	
	Ground 3 is that:
	


The trial miscarried on account of directions on self-defence given by the trial judge:

(a)   when attempting to correct the prosecutor's closing address;

(b)   in failing to direct the jury to disregard parts of the Crown address that were erroneous or that argued a position that was not part of the Crown case;

(c)   in failing to direct the jury on the issue of 'pre-emptive strike' or self-defence in response to a threat of harm.


	
	Finally, the appellant argues by ground 4 that the jury’s verdict in finding him guilty of murder was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence.
	


Conviction appeal - Ground 1: The trial miscarried because the trial judge erred in permitting the prosecutor to impugn the joint agreement of the ballistics experts


	
	As explained in [28] above, the ballistics experts were Dr Van der Walt and Mr Barber. The agreement reached between them as to parts of the evidence summarised above, and the circumstances in which the Crown sought to adduce evidence beyond that agreement, are sufficiently summarised in the following extract from the judgment delivered by the trial judge addressing the admissibility of that further evidence: R v Abdallah (No 3) [2014] NSWSC 267:
	


4   I should say something about how the agreement between Mr Van Der Walt and Mr Barber came about. It was the expectation of the learned Crown Prosecutor that Mr Van Der Walt's evidence would be led on Monday of this week. He forestalled his hand in that regard because Mr Dalton proposed that the ballistics experts confer in an attempt to produce a document like MFI 12 setting out those matters upon which they agreed and those matters upon which they disagree, in the latter event stating short reasons for their disagreement. That procedure is familiar in the civil jurisdiction exercised by this Court.

5   MFI 12 does not quite achieve that purpose but it has been made clear from comments made by the Crown to me this afternoon that it does record the matters which fall within that first category, that is to say matters upon which the experts are able to agree. To the extent to which it deals with the question of the range from which certain wounds were inflicted upon the deceased by gunshot it is agreed between the experts that where they have expressed a range rather than a precise distance that range is as precise as persons professing their expertise can be with the available information. As Mr Dalton points out, one reason why no greater certainty can be brought to bear is the firearm which shot the bullets is not, and never has been, available to the prosecution, or either of the experts.

6   Under the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) evidence contradicting an agreement arrived at by experts conferring for that purpose may not be contradicted without leave of the Court. I interpolate that I understand from what has been put to me in argument that the Crown seeks in a sense to contradict the terms of the agreement because it will argue in due course that taking the ballistics evidence together with the lay and other evidence in the case the jury ought to be satisfied that, for example, wound 1 in MFI 12, a wound to the victim's head, was inflicted with either hard or close contact and that inferences should be drawn from such a finding in relation to the intention of the person who fired the shot.

7   However, this is not a civil case, it is a criminal case in which the rules of evidence are provided by the Evidence Act 1995 and I am bound to apply its provisions in determining all questions of the admissibility of evidence. There is no provision in the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), as it applies to this case that would have permitted me to give a direction, or make an order that the parties were bound by the agreement arrived at by the experts. I think it is fair to say that the Crown indicated before me today, this morning, and when this objection was made later, that this is not an agreement that they regard themselves, or the learned Crown Prosecutor regards himself, bound by.

8   Section 191 of the Evidence Act 1995 permits parties to a proceeding, including a criminal proceeding, to agree facts, and, where there is an agreement, evidence may not be adduced to contradict or qualify an agreed fact unless I grant leave. But that provision is subject to an important precondition provided by s 191(3) requiring that the agreed fact must be ‘stated in an agreement in writing signed by the parties or by’ - I omit some words –‘[the] legal counsel or prosecutor representing them, and adduced in evidence in the proceedings’.

9   MFI 12 records an agreement between the experts, it does not record an agreement between the parties to which s 191 applies, and accordingly the Crown do not require leave to adduce the evidence objected to.

10   This then means that the question of the admissibility of this evidence must be decided pursuant to the provisions of the Evidence Act.

11   Before I turn to that question I should observe that it is most unfortunate that I was under a misapprehension about what was proposed when the experts were asked to confer. Had I appreciated at the time that any agreement arrived at between the experts would be something between them alone and not something by which the parties would consider themselves bound, I probably would not have granted an adjournment to enable the conclave of experts, as it is informally called in civil proceedings, to take place. Rather, I would have thought it better for the evidence to be elicited in the usual way. Moreover, even if I had thought it worthwhile in those circumstances to permit that process to take place, I would not have thought it appropriate to mention anything about the process to the jury, as I have done on more than one occasion. In any event, all the jury have been told is that the experts have reached an agreement about certain matters and that, of course, is accurate.


	
	His Honour then turned to consider particular provisions of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW): s 55 (relevance) and s 137 (exclusion of evidence where the probative value is outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice). He concluded that the evidence was admissible.
	


The appellant’s submissions


	
	Senior counsel for the appellant submits that the “Crown should not have been permitted to elicit further evidence on the agreed points from the witness or to impugn the joint agreement”.  This submission relies on Pt 75, Div 1, r 3K of the Supreme Court Rules 1970 (NSW). Part 75 is concerned with certain criminal proceedings, including that presently under consideration. Rule 3K is in the following terms:
	


3K   Conference between experts

(1)   The Court may do any or all of the following, with the consent of the parties:

(a)   direct expert witnesses to confer (whether before or during a trial or other proceedings),

(b)   specify the matters on which they are to confer,

(c)   direct that they provide the Court with a joint report specifying matters agreed and matters not agreed and the reasons for any non agreement,

(d)   direct that such conference be held with or without the attendance of the legal representatives of the parties affected, or with or without the attendance of legal representatives at the option of the parties respectively,

(e)   give any additional directions as may be considered necessary.

(2)   An expert who is the subject of an order made under subrule (1) may apply to the Court for further directions.

(3)   The content of the conference between the expert witnesses is not to be referred to at the hearing or trial unless the parties affected agree.

(4)   The parties may agree, at any time, to be bound by agreement on any specified matter. In that event, the joint report may be tendered at the trial as evidence of the matter agreed. Otherwise, the joint report may be used or tendered at the trial only in accordance with the rules of evidence and the practices of the Court.

(5)   Where, pursuant to this rule, expert witnesses have conferred and have provided a joint report agreeing on any matter, a party affected may not, without leave of the Court, adduce expert evidence inconsistent with the matter agreed.


	
	It is said that the powers of criminal trial judges in the Supreme Court “in circumstances where there has been agreement between experts, both as a matter of fairness, efficiency and criminal procedure should be clarified by this Court”, particularly because the judgment of “the trial judge has been widely published and should not be relied on as precedent for the governing criteria where there is an application to resile from agreements between experts in a Supreme Court criminal trial”.
	


The Crown submissions


	
	The Crown contends that r 3K had no application. It was not mentioned at trial and, most significantly, there was no direction made pursuant to sub-rule (1). It was submitted that in those circumstances his Honour correctly decided the admissibility of the further evidence sought to be led from Dr Van der Walt by reference to s 191 of the Evidence Act.
	


Determination


	
	The position was correctly stated by the Crown. Rule 3K in Pt 75 of the Supreme Court Rules was not engaged. The trial judge did not give a direction that the experts confer, or specify any part of that process pursuant to r 3K(1), and so, r 3K(5) did not apply. Accordingly, there was no impediment to the Crown adducing any evidence inconsistent with that which had been agreed.
	
	
	The trial judge was correct to determine that leave was not required under s 191 of the Evidence Act to adduce the evidence sought to be led from Dr Van der Walt. That section is concerned with facts agreed between parties; the matter under consideration concerned opinions agreed upon by expert witnesses. The Crown Prosecutor did not regard himself as being a party to any agreement as to those conclusions and counsel for the appellant did not suggest that he was.
	


Observations about expert evidence in criminal proceedings


	
	It is appropriate to say a little more about r 3K. It, along with r 3J (which provides for the application of the expert witness code of conduct in Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (UCPR), Sch 7), was inserted into Pt 75 by the Supreme Court Rules (Amendment No 363) 2002: see New South Wales Government Gazette, No 135, 30 August 2002, at 7667ff. An explanatory note reveals the purpose for the introduction of these provisions:
	


Explanatory note 

The object of these Rules is to extend to criminal trials, with some modification, the Rules relating to conferences between expert witnesses that presently apply in civil trials. In particular these Rules:

(a)   require an expert witness to read and be bound by the expert witness code of conduct found in Schedule K of the Rules, and

(b)   require a party that engages an expert witness to serve any supplementary report by the expert on any other party, if that party has been served an earlier report by the expert and the expert has changed his or her opinion on a material matter contained in that report, and

(c)   permit the Court, with the consent of the parties, to:

(i)   direct expert witnesses to confer before or during the trial, and

(ii)   specify the matters on which they are to confer, and

(iii)   require them to provide the Court with a joint report specifying matters agreed, matters not agreed and the reasons for non agreement, and

(iv)   make directions as to whether the legal representatives of the parties are to be permitted at a conference between expert witnesses, and

(v)   give any additional directions as may be considered necessary, and

(d)   prohibit a party from adducing expert evidence inconsistent with a matter that has been agreed on pursuant to these new Rules unless that party is granted leave by the Court.


	
	The reference to the rules relating to conferences between expert witnesses that apply in civil trials is to the rules found in Pt 31, Div 2 of the UCPR.
	
	
	Aside from rr 3J and 3K having potential application in relation to expert evidence in criminal proceedings in the Supreme Court, there is also the specific adoption by Pt 75, Div 1, r 3(1)(f) of rr 31.21 and 31.22 of the UCPR in such proceedings. Rule 31.22 makes provision for an expert to disclose the details of fees. Rule 31.21 provides:
	


31.21   Expert evidence in chief to be given by way of experts’ reports

Unless the court otherwise orders, an expert witness’s evidence in chief must be given by the tender of one or more expert’s reports.


	
	The applicability of some of the civil procedure rules relating to expert evidence in Supreme Court criminal proceedings has no counterpart in the District Court Rules 1973 (NSW). Johnson J, relevantly with the agreement of Beazley JA (as her Honour then was) and McCallum J, observed in Haoui v R [2008] NSWCCA 209; 188 A Crim R 331 at [153] that “Section 171D District Court Act 1973 provides that, subject to that Act and the District Court Rules, the procedure and practice of the District Court when exercising criminal jurisdiction shall, so far as practicable, be the same as the procedure and practice of the Supreme Court when exercising similar jurisdiction”. However, his Honour later (at [155]) observed that it was difficult to see how this provision could extend to applying the Supreme Court Rules in the District Court.
	
	
	Johnson J had further occasion to discuss expert evidence in the context of some of these rules, particularly UCPR, r 31.21, in R v Milne (No 1) [2010] NSWSC 932; 260 FLR 166 at [218]-[225].
	
	
	The point of all of this is to observe that these provisions, whilst obviously intended to promote the efficient conduct of criminal proceedings, have not, in the collective memory of the members of this Court, been applied in trials in the Supreme Court. Furthermore there would seem to be good reason why the same or equivalent provisions should apply in the busiest criminal trial court in the country, the District Court of New South Wales. This last comment is made on the basis that it is at least doubtful that those provisions currently apply by the operation of s 171D.
	


Conviction appeal - Grounds 2 and 3: The trial miscarried on account of the Crown Prosecutor’s closing address and/or directions which were or should have been given by the trial judge


	
	It is convenient to deal with Grounds 2 and 3 together. They are principally concerned with two complaints, namely that in its closing address the Crown misstated the law on self-defence and sought to, and was allowed to, make a case which involved a material change from that adopted by the Crown in opening and in the conduct of the trial. Ground 2 is addressed to the Crown’s conduct in those respects and Grounds 3(a) and (b) to the adequacy of the trial judge’s response. Ground 3(c) separately contends that the trial miscarried because the trial judge did not direct the jury on the issue of ‘pre-emptive strike’ or self-defence in response to a threat of harm.
	


Whether the trial miscarried because the law on self defence was incorrectly put to the jury and that error was not sufficiently remedied (Grounds 2 and 3(a))?


	
	Under the common law when self-defence was raised in a murder trial, the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not believe on reasonable grounds that it was necessary in self-defence to do what he did when his act caused the death of the deceased: Zecevic v Director of Public Prosecutions (Vic) [1987] HCA 26; 162 CLR 645.
	
	
	In New South Wales the common law position was amended in February 2002. Section 418 of the Crimes Act (inserted by the Crimes Amendment (Self-defence) Act 2001 (NSW)) relevantly provided:
	


418   Self-defence – when available 

(1)   A person is not criminally responsible for an offence if the person carries out the conduct constituting the offence in self-defence.

(2)   A person carries out conduct in self-defence if and only if the person believes the conduct is necessary:

a)   to defend himself or herself or another person;

…

and the conduct is a reasonable response in the circumstances as he or she perceives them.


	
	Where self-defence is raised as an issue, the prosecutor has the onus of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not carry out the relevant conduct in self-defence: Crimes Act, s 419.
	
	
	Once that defence was raised (as it was here by the appellant’s evidence), to eliminate self-defence as an issue the Crown was required to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant did not believe his conduct in shooting the deceased was necessary in order to defend himself (a question to be determined subjectively) or that there was no reasonable likelihood that his conduct was a reasonable response to the circumstances as he perceived them (a question requiring an objective assessment of the proportionality of that response to the situation which the appellant subjectively believed he faced): R v Katarzynski [2002] NSWSC 613 at [22]-[23] (per Howie J), cited with approval in R v Oblach [2005] NSWCCA 440; 65 NSWLR 75 at [50]-[54] (per Spigelman CJ). If the Crown had not satisfied the jury as to the first matter but did satisfy them as to the second, they were directed to find the appellant guilty of manslaughter by excessive self-defence: Crimes Act, s 421.
	
	
	The appellant submits that the trial miscarried because the Crown Prosecutor proceeded on the basis of the common law test as to self-defence. He repeatedly described what had to be addressed as including whether there were reasonable grounds for the appellant’s belief as to necessity and, in the way he did so, suggested that the onus of proving the existence of such grounds was upon the appellant. The Crown accepts that these errors were made. However, it submits that they were not so pervasive as to cause the trial to miscarry and that the trial judge’s subsequent directions specifically addressed and remedied them.
	
	
	The appellant pointed to several statements in the Crown’s closing that contained these errors. They included the following: (tcpt 11/03/14, pp 1194-1195, 1199)
	


And even if he had that belief he had, was it based on reasonable grounds…

So did he have a belief, did he believe he had to do what he did? And even if he had that belief, was it really based on reasonable grounds …

…

[W]ere those beliefs really on reasonable grounds? …

[D]id he believe it on reasonable grounds?

…

In the second limb, that is, the reasonableness of that belief, you might ask yourselves these sorts of questions: Even if everything he thought about Mr Todorovski was what fuelled him to do what he did, did [sic] his justification for holding the belief or the things that led him to believe such things reasonable? That is, were they the product of reason or paranoia or some other foundation that just isn’t plain and reasonable …


	
	It was further submitted that the Crown’s repeated references to the appellant’s belief as being ‘genuine’ or ‘genuinely’ held, also and separately conveyed, not only that the belief had to be held in fact, but that it had to be based on reasonable grounds. This was said to exacerbate and entrench in the minds of the jury, the Crown’s misstatement of the law of self-defence, causing the trial to miscarry. In our view, that is not correct. Subject to one or two exceptions, on each occasion that there was a reference to the belief being ‘genuine’, the context made clear that it did no more than emphasise that it had to be a real belief, rather than one that was confected or contrived. Three examples illustrating this follow: (tcpt 11/03/14, pp 1193, 1194, 1198)
	


Where this issue must go is you’ve got to consider the thinking and intentions of the accused, what his state of mind was, when you answer this ultimate question I’ve already indicated to you you will consider. And that is whether the claim to self-defence is genuine, and not confected or manufactured.

…

This issue of trust is relevant here, because when you’re talking about whether someone’s motives are genuine, and you’re hearing witnesses on the topic, you’ve got to decide, “Who do I trust? Whether that person is telling the truth. Is that person reliable? Are they credible?” So your assessment of people is brought into play here, not just the accused’s state of mind, but also the evidence of witnesses. You’ve got to judge their credibility as well.

…

So this question of belief, was it genuine, you might ask yourselves, “Well maybe he didn’t really believe he had to shoot. Maybe he was going to do it anyway”. And the evidence of the threat, “I am going to get a gun and shoot you” – maybe he was going to do it anyway. Or at least, contemplating the possibility of inflicting violence.

Because, in other words, another inference you might draw is well, “You don’t carry around a loaded firearm in this situation unless you’ve thought about the possibility of using it.” So these are things that go to his belief, this genuine quality. “Did he really believe he had to do that?”


	
	In the passages below the Crown Prosecutor is said to have gone further and suggested that the quality of ‘genuineness’ included or required that there be reasonable grounds for the belief: (tcpt 11/03/14, pp 1194, 1195, 1199)
	


Now, there is some assistance to be given by looking to analogous situations but, plainly, you’ve got two issues, that both go to the question of the genuineness of this claim. Did he really believe he needed to do what he did in order to defend himself? And even if he had that belief he had, was it based on reasonable grounds, or was it just, well something else …

…

[Y]ou would be required to look at the evidence, draw the inferences and determine whether he actually believed that he had to do what he did, and even if he had believed it, were those beliefs really on reasonable grounds?

So those questions are within the context of what the law seeks to do in this area, the obligations of the citizen, and the standards of what is regarded as reasonable in the circumstances, and that is uniquely within the province of the jury, and they’re very much fundamentally based, in this trial, on the question of the genuineness of the belief.

…

So it’s quite a big gradient from a misunderstanding on the mobile phone to killing man because you feared him so much that you took a gun with you to a meeting he didn’t even need to go to he [feared] him that much.

So how genuine does that sound? You will bring that to these two limbs: Genuineness of belief, reasonableness that is the foundation. The Crown submits to you the fact that this belief that he says to you he had that he had to kill Mr Todorovski he didn’t genuinely hold, and you might, I would submit to you, see that in the evidence of the assault, the fight in the weeks preceding the killing.


	
	These passages are somewhat confused and also proceed on the incorrect basis that the relevant belief must be held on reasonable grounds. Each also suggests in some degree, but certainly not clearly, that, as was observed by McPherson JA in R v Acton [2001] QCA 155 at [16] (in a passage cited by Spigelman CJ in Oblach at [43]), the fact that there may have been objectively reasonable bases for the asserted belief is separately relevant to an assessment of whether the asserted belief was actually held. However in our view, the use of the descriptor ‘genuine’ in those passages conveyed nothing more than that the belief had to be truly or actually held. For that reason the repeated use of that description did not further exacerbate the Crown Prosecutor’s error. It remains to consider whether the erroneous statements of law, which the Crown conceded did occur, were remedied by the trial judge’s directions.
	
	
	At no time during the Crown’s closing address did senior counsel for the appellant object to the Crown Prosecutor’s explanation of the issues arising under s 418 or to his repeated use of the term ‘genuine’ to describe his client’s belief. Such an unexplained failure to object often suggests that ‘in the atmosphere of the trial, counsel saw no injustice as to what was being done’: Jubraeel v R [2015] NSWCCA 131 at [24]-[25] and the authorities there discussed. However, in this case it is likely that counsel considered that the matter could and would be clarified by the trial judge’s summing up.
	
	
	At the time of the Crown’s closing address, counsel had a draft of the written directions which the trial judge proposed to give, including those on self-defence. Those directions correctly described the questions for the jury in relation to that issue. In his closing address senior counsel for the appellant, not unexpectedly having regard to what had occurred in the Crown’s address, foreshadowed those directions: (tcpt 12/03/14, pp 1301, 1303)
	


… [H]is Honour I anticipate will give you directions that the Crown would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there was no reasonable possibility that the accused believed that shooting the victim was necessary in order to defend himself, or words to that effect. Of course whichever way his Honour actually gives you that direction will be the direction you’ll apply

…

The second matter that I understand his Honour will also direct you in respect of this question is, has the Crown proved beyond a reasonable doubt that there is no reasonable possibility that what the accused did was a reasonable response in the circumstances as he perceived them.


	
	Early in the course of his summing up, the trial judge provided the jury with those written directions, which stated that it was for the Crown to prove “beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not kill Mr Todorovski in self-defence” and that:
	


12   Whether self-defence operates as a complete defence depends on your answer to each of the following questions. If your answer to both is no you will find the accused not guilty of murder (and also of manslaughter). The questions are:

(a)   Are you actually satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not genuinely believe that shooting Mr Todorovski was necessary in order to defend himself; and

(b)   Are you actually satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that what the accused did was not a reasonable response to the circumstances as he perceived them.


	
	In his summing up the trial judge emphasised that: (tcpt 13/03/14, p 24)
	


… the Crown carries the onus of negativing, is the word I will use, self-defence beyond reasonable doubt. If the Crown does not discharge its onus, the accused is entitled to be acquitted of the charge of murder.


	
	Having read paragraph 12 of the written directions, the trial judge continued: (tcpt 13/03/14, p 26)
	


Let me go back. It’s a bit clumsy because of the double negative there. But that is to reflect the important point that it is for the prosecution to prove the negative proposition beyond reasonable doubt. It can’t be avoided, I’m sorry, ladies and gentlemen, you have to deal with it.


	
	The trial judge then explained that, whilst not detracting from what he had said about the onus and standard of proof:
	


… [S]ometimes judges formulate a proposition in terms of is there a reasonable possibility that the accused genuinely believed that shooting Mr Todorovski was necessary in order to defend himself …. Sometimes judges will say is there a reasonable possibility that what the accused did was a reasonable response to the circumstances as he perceived them


	
	The trial judge returned to the first of these questions, pointing out that it must be decided “from a wholly subjective standpoint” taking into account “all the circumstances established by the evidence, but as the accused perceived them to be at the relevant time”.
	
	
	His Honour then addressed the jury on the error made by the Crown Prosecutor in the course of his closing address: (tcpt 13/03/14, p 28)
	


In the course of addresses Mr Crown, with great respect to him, said you had to be satisfied there were reasonable grounds for a genuine belief that what the accused did was necessary to defend himself. That formulation of reasonable grounds is a slip of the tongue, it is not quite correct. The formulation is as I have given it to you. You are not talking about whether he had reasonable grounds for his belief, you are asking whether what he did was a reasonable response to the circumstances as he perceived them. So you will appreciate that that second issue about whether the accused’s conduct was a reasonable response in the circumstances as he perceived them, is different from the first consideration, because it does call for an objective assessment of the proportionality of the accused’s response to the situation he subjectively believed he faced.


	
	The appellant suggests that the trial judge’s characterisation of the Crown’s error as a “slip of the tongue” diminished the significance of that error and that this was reflected in his description of the Crown’s closing address as being “not quite correct”. Whether that is so is beside the point because the trial judge emphasised that the jury’s duty was to accept and apply the principles of law as stated by him (tcpt 13/03/14, pp 2-3, 4) and to seek further directions if they had “any doubt about those principles” (tcpt 13/03/14, p 80). Those principles were correctly stated by the trial judge, including in the written directions which were most likely to guide the jury in its consideration. The reasons for that were explained by Simpson J in Justins v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 242; 79 NSWLR 544 at [242]:
	


Written directions are, in my opinion, a most useful, important and, in some cases, crucial development in the conduct of criminal trials. … [It] must also be remembered that a jury will have the written directions in the jury room long after the oral directions have concluded. It will be written directions to which the jury will have resort, perhaps repeatedly. And the force of the written word will be likely to override the recollection the jury has of the oral directions.


	
	Although the trial judge also used the adverb ‘genuinely’ in his statement of the first question for the jury on the issue of self-defence, the context made plain that it was used to emphasise that the belief had to be actually held. The appellant’s submission that the use of that word imported the Crown’s earlier error of suggesting that any belief had to be held on reasonable grounds, is rejected.
	
	
	The appellant also asserts that the trial judge’s “re-direction in relation to the second limb reversed the onus of proof”. That is not so, as the discussion above shows. Although later in the summing up the trial judge characterised the second question as being “was the response in your judgment reasonable in the circumstances as he perceived them to be”, it was made clear by the trial judge’s earlier references to the onus of proof and the use of the double negative, that the Crown was required to satisfy the jury beyond reasonable doubt that what the appellant did was not a reasonable response. Furthermore, when posing that question by reference to the evidence, the trial judge formulated the second question as being “are you satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that getting the gun and shooting was not a reasonable response” (tcpt 13/03/14, p 29).
	
	
	The appellant has not identified any miscarriage of justice arising from the conceded errors made in the course of the Crown’s closing address. Those errors were corrected by the trial judge’s subsequent directions. As no request for further directions was made by the appellant’s counsel at the conclusion of the summing up, r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW) applies. Leave to raise Ground 2, to the extent that it relies on those errors, and Ground 3(a) should be refused.
	


Whether the trial miscarried because the Crown’s case as put to the jury involved a departure from its case as opened (Grounds 2 and 3(b))?


	
	The appellant submits that the trial miscarried because in his closing address the Crown Prosecutor departed from the Crown case put in opening. It is said that the Crown case as opened, and as stated in the Crown Case Statement (see [15] above), was that the appellant had shot the deceased in the back, stepped closer to him as he was lying on the roadway, and then fired three rounds into his head, all at contact or near contact range.
	
	
	It is then pointed out that Mr Boutsikakis’ evidence significantly departed from that case by maintaining that there had been two separate incidents of shooting, between which the appellant had chased and shot at Mr Leger. On this account the three shots to the head were said to be fired after that chase. The evidence of the remaining eye witnesses (see [22] to [27] above) was not consistent with there having been such separate incidents of shooting. That evidence was that no shots were fired after the appellant, having chased Mr Leger, returned to his car. (Although he resiled from it subsequently (tcpt 03/03/14, p 640), it is noted that Mr Mataipule had earlier given a statement, similar to that of Mr Boutsikakis, suggesting that there were further gunshots after the appellant returned from chasing Mr Leger (tcpt 03/03/14, p 631)).
	
	
	At trial each eye witness described a series or succession of shots occurring before the chase commenced. Although some of the evidence was less than clear as to the number or sequence of shots, the various descriptions given accommodated the possibility, asserted by the Crown in opening, of a brief or momentary pause within the initial episode of shooting. For example, Ms Alexander described a ""succession of bangs following the first"" gunshot, which was ""a bit more… stand alone"" (tcpt 04/03/14, pp 716, 720). Mr Mataipule denied that the shots were fired in quick succession, maintaining that he heard ""several other gunshots"" following the initial shot which attracted his attention (tcpt 03/03/14, pp 616, 636). Mr Baker's adamant description was that there were five “consecutive” shots, a ""very short pause"" of less than fifteen seconds and then a sixth shot (tcpt 05/03/14, p 794). Two witnesses agreed that the shots were fired “in quick succession”. Exactly what that involved, and whether it meant the shots were equally spaced, was not explored (tcpt 03/03/14, pp 665; 04/03/14, p 698).
	
	
	In relation to whether the shots to the head were fired as the deceased lay on the ground, the expert and other crime scene evidence did not establish the position of his body at the time of the shooting. Although the roadway was examined, no sign of any gouge marks or other damage was found consistent with the deceased having been shot in the head as he lay on the road surface (see [38]-[39] above).
	
	
	The appellant suggests that to accommodate these evidentiary difficulties, the Crown Prosecutor “changed” the case as opened by submitting in closing that the jury could convict on the murder count whether there were two separate incidents of shooting (as Mr Boutsikakis maintained) or six shots fired consecutively and, in the latter case, irrespective of whether the head shots were fired after the deceased had been shot in the back, as the Crown opened, or before, as was the sequence of events given by the appellant in his evidence.
	
	
	The appellant submits that the trial judge should have drawn attention to these asserted changes in the Crown’s case and, it would seem, directed the jury to disregard them. The effect of such a direction would have been to prevent the jury from finding the appellant guilty of murder if they had a reasonable doubt as to whether the head shots were fired first but were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he had not acted in self-defence. It followed that if they were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the head shots were fired second, whether separately or as the Crown opened its case, the jury was then required to acquit the appellant of murder and manslaughter.
	
	
	Concerns associated with any change in the prosecution’s case in a criminal trial arise from considerations of fairness and procedural disadvantage. Unfairness may arise because of tactical and forensic assessments made by the defence as the case proceeds and with reference to the issues understood to arise on the Crown case. Those assessments may affect decisions as to the cross-examination of witnesses, objections to evidence, the adducing of evidence and the making of closing submissions. A change in the case to be met could lead to prejudice or unfairness because those earlier decisions may not be able to be revisited or accommodated as the trial proceeds. For these reasons, ordinarily once the Crown has laid out the way in which it puts its case, it is required to adhere to that formulation: per Johnson J in Robinson v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 192; 162 A Crim R 88 at [138]-[141].
	
	
	There was no such change in the Crown’s case at trial. From the outset it was made clear that the issue in relation to the murder count was self-defence. The appellant had shot and killed the deceased. There could have been no doubt that he intended to cause at least serious injury. Six shots had been fired, two at close range into his head. In its opening the Crown described the “important” question for the jury as being the appellant’s “state of mind when he let fly this volley of shots” (tcpt 19/02/14, p 44). The defence agreed, describing that question as being whether the Crown could discharge its onus by disproving that the appellant fired the “volley of shots” because he thought he was going to die (tcpt 19/02/14, pp 57, 58).
	
	
	The Crown and defence accepted in their openings, and the conduct of the trial shows, that the sequence in which the shots may have been fired was a significant factor in the jury’s consideration of the issue of self-defence. The Crown case as opened was that the close shots to the head were fired after the deceased had fallen to the ground, making it most unlikely that the appellant could have believed that those shots were necessary in self-defence (tcpt 19/02/14, p 49). The defence case was that there was “no shooting on the ground” (tcpt 19/02/14, p 61).
	
	
	However, at no stage in either party’s opening was it suggested or accepted that the Crown could only succeed by satisfying the jury beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased was shot in the head as he lay on the ground. In the way the cases were opened (see [16], [17] and [86] above) the issue of self-defence arose in relation to the firing of the “volley of shots”, irrespective of whether there was any “shooting on the ground”. That position did not change in the course of the trial. The appellant said that when he fired the shots his only intention was to stop the deceased from killing him (tcpt 07/03/14, pp 976-977, 1018-1019). Although the Crown suggested in cross-examination that the shots to the head were fired after Mr Leger was chased (tcpt 07/03/14, pp 1057, 1058), it was also put more generally that the appellant had intended to kill the deceased from the time he retrieved the gun, or at least from the time of the first shot, and that intention explained why he “pulled the trigger so many times” (tcpt 07/03/14, pp 1058-1059).
	
	
	In its closing address, the Crown invited the jury to conclude that the later shots were fired while the deceased was on the ground (tcpt 11/03/14, pp 1211-1212). However, and more significantly, the Crown relied on a number of matters as justifying the jury being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had not acted in self-defence, irrespective of the timing or order of the shots. Those matters included that the deceased was shot six times (tcpt 11/03/14, pp 1195, 1199, 1231); that he was shot in the back or while he was turning away from the appellant (tcpt 11/03/14, pp 1195, 1212); that he was shot at point blank and close range in the head (tcpt 11/03/14, p 1203); and that the deceased was armed but had not drawn his gun at the time he was shot (tcpt 11/03/14, p 1205).
	
	
	The Crown sought to link the implausibility of the appellant’s evidence as to how the shooting occurred to the rejection of his evidence as to his subjective belief in the necessity of his actions: (tcpt 11/03/14, p 1232)
	


[The t-shirt worn by the appellant during the initial altercation] was subject to some force that caused it to tear in the opposite direction. So that may, you may think, be inconsistent with the account he gave of having been on the ground, curled up and then crawling his way to the car door to successfully obtain the gun. Evidently, men armed with a knife, with a gun, just stood there and waited until they were shot at. Does that sound like a genuine account to you of how he came to get the gun which they can’t have known he had… [L]et me say these things to you: This is not a case where this man was genuinely of the view or belief that he had to do what he did.


	
	Particular emphasis was placed on the fact that the appellant had shot the deceased in the head at close range. The jury was told: (tcpt 11/03/14, p 1203)
	


There’s evidence as to the order of events part in this trial and it relates to two areas: One is the order of events, because Mr Boutsikakis, he gives an account which involves the accused shooting Mr Todorovski in the head after the chase with Mr Leger. Then there are accounts which have the chase after a series of shots and he’s shot thereafter. It’s not for the Crown to prove which of those scenarios are the one because, on either scenario, he shot him, Mr Todorovski, without self-defence, and chased Mr Leger without self-defence. So it doesn’t matter when he shot Mr Todorovski in the head because it’s not information to you but you know he shot him in the head. He shot him in the head. And the evidence is more than that in that there’s a range he shot in the head.


	
	It is true that the defence closing focussed on “whether or not the Crown could prove … beyond reasonable doubt that [the appellant], after shooting [the deceased], in obvious, I submit, self-defence, went and shot him a second separate time” while he was on the ground (tcpt 11/03/14, p 1239; 12/03/14, pp 1281-2, 1285, 1303). It is also true that the Crown Prosecutor did not, other than by putting the arguments referred to above, specifically address how self-defence was negatived on the appellant’s version of the sequence of shots. However, from the outset it remained open to the jury to find that the Crown had negatived that defence, even if the shooting occurred as the appellant described. The Crown did not confine its case in the way the appellant’s argument now suggests. As such, it did not, by its closing argument, introduce issues that were not made apparent at the commencement of the trial.
	
	
	Consistently with that being the position, the trial judge identified the ways in which the Crown case was put: (tcpt 13/03/14, pp 52-53, 67-68)
	


The Crown also says, we have got a strong case, and that evidence is enough, and we don’t care whether you think all six shots were fired at once, or whether three were fired at one time, and the accused came back for some more. It doesn’t matter to us, is the argument put to you. But the Crown says, if you accept Mr Boutsikakis, and why wouldn’t you, the fact that there may have been a second episode of shooting, after Todorovski was already down and immobilised, only makes a strong Crown case stronger. What could be more apparent than a man who fired three shots at one man, chased another and shot at him, then came back and shot the first man, than the shooter intended to kill, and he intended to kill not in self-defence. That’s the Crown case.

…

But the question is, of course, the question is can you on the whole of the evidence and all of the circumstances that you find established by the evidence dismiss what was put in that regard [as to the timing and sequence of the shots] as at least a reasonable hypothesis consistent with the innocence of the accused on the ground of complete self-defence. Now that is how the case is put and these things are for you to decide.

On the Crown case … Even if you put aside Mr Boutsikakis and the second episode of shooting, [the gun] was fired at very close, point-blank range in fact, that from that you would work on the basis that, generally speaking, people intend the natural consequences of their actions. There is no presumption of law in that regard but that is an inference that is open to you if you think it is correct in the circumstances and you should simply accept that, as I have said, the accused intended to use the gun and discharged it six times because he meant to make sure of it. That is the Crown case.


	
	The absence of any complaint from senior counsel for the appellant concerning these aspects of the Crown’s closing and the summing up is wholly consistent with his implicit acknowledgment that it was open to the jury to reject his claim of self-defence in circumstances where they considered it reasonably possible that the shooting occurred in the sequence he described, but disbelieved his evidence as to his belief in the necessity of those actions.
	
	
	There was no departure by the Crown from its case as opened. Leave to raise these grounds also should be refused.
	


Whether the trial miscarried because the trial judge did not direct the jury on the question of ‘pre-emptive strike’ (Ground 3(c))?


	
	The appellant submits that the trial judge should have given the jury “a direction in accordance with Conlon [(1993) 69 A Crim R 92] at 98”. The specific direction which it is said should have been given is not described and, more significantly, no such direction was sought from the trial judge.
	
	
	Conlon was a decision of Hunt CJ at CL, sitting in a judge-alone murder trial. The accused had been attacked late at night by two men in the remote farmhouse where he was growing cannabis. Hunt CJ at CL found at 96 that there was “a very real possibility that [his] perception of the position in which he found himself was reduced by a degree of intoxication on his part from alcohol and marijuana”. The accused managed to get away from the men and retrieved a loaded semi-automatic rifle. He started shooting at the men and continued to do so even when outside the farmhouse. He came across one of the men crouching at the front of the house. Not appreciating that he had already wounded the man with at least two shots, he shot him in the head at close range.
	
	
	The Crown case included that there were no reasonable grounds for the accused’s belief that it was necessary in self-defence to fire that bullet. In relation to that question, Hunt CJ at CL said at 98:
	


However, it is well established that a person defending himself from a threatened attack and who has to react instantly to imminent danger cannot be expected to weigh precisely the exact measure of self-defensive action which is required: Palmer [1971] AC 814 at 831-832; Zecevic v DPP (at 662-663; 174-175). The accused was not obliged to wait until the attack upon him was repeated. If he honestly believed that the attack would be repeated, he was entitled to take steps to forestall that threatened attack before it was begun: Morgan v Colman (1981) 27 SASR 334 at 336-337; (1981) 4 A Crim R 324 at 326. This was a situation in which a pre-emptive strike was justified: Beckford [1988] AC 130 at 144. [Emphasis added] 


	
	We have emphasised in the above extract what we assume to be the substance of the direction that it is said the trial judge should have given. The occasion which is said to have given rise to the need for that direction was a question from the jury (marked as MFI 63) in the following terms: (tcpt 14/03/14, p 101)
	


In regards to, ‘Necessary in order to defend himself’, does this just apply to defend himself against an immediate threat or can it apply to both immediate and future threat?’


	
	It is apparent that this question related to the first limb of the trial judge’s written direction on self-defence (written direction para 12(a)). So understanding it, the trial judge considered it likely that the question, with its reference to a “future threat”, was directed to the second count rather than the first (tcpt 14/03/14, p 103). The Crown Prosecutor and the appellant’s counsel agreed, no doubt because, to that point, the trial had proceeded on the basis that the question of the appellant acting pre-emptively in self-defence only arose in relation to the count of attempted murder. In that context, the Crown Prosecutor had told the jury early in his closing address: (tcpt 11/03/14, p 1191)
	


Now, you’re entitled to act in self-defence, as the word conveys, but you’re also entitled to act pre-emptively. If you believe you are going to be attacked you don’t have to stand passively by, and this pre-emptive point of self-defence of the accused is relying upon count 2, because he says that he was acting pre-emptively in chasing Mr Leger, as you recall.


	
	The appellant submits that a direction on pre-emptive strike was required in relation to the murder count because the Crown’s case was (or was said to have become) that the appellant had shot the deceased after having broken free of the fight in circumstances where the appellant knew a loaded gun remained in the deceased’s pocket. The submission suggests that, on the Crown case, the appellant could only have been responding to a threatened rather than immediate attack using that gun.
	
	
	The appellant’s evidence (as set out in [11] above) was that as the kicking stopped the deceased said to him, “[y]ou’re fucking dead” and looked to be reaching into his pocket for the gun the appellant had earlier seen. Thus the danger to which the appellant was responding was not merely threatened. It was immediate and, on his case, about to happen. There was no need in such circumstances for the trial judge to give a specific direction as to pre-emptive strike to assist the jury’s deliberations in relation to self-defence. It was not the appellant’s case and, as the Crown submits, any suggestion that the danger to which the appellant was responding was only threatened would have understated that case.
	
	
	With the agreement of both counsel, the direction given by the trial judge in answer to the jury’s question (tcpt 14/03/14, pp 106-108) was in general terms, and not specifically directed to either of the counts. It emphasised that the question whether the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not believe that the shooting was necessary to defend himself was one of fact; and that the existence of a threat, how real it was and what it required were matters to be considered when addressing that question. The trial judge also pointed out that such threat may be “immediate or it may be, may I put it this way, less immediate”. Senior counsel for the appellant did not, at the conclusion of that direction, suggest that anything further should be said by way of qualification or addition.
	
	
	The appellant has not established that there was any error in the trial judge’s not having given a specific direction concerning ‘pre-emptive strike’ with respect to the murder count, or in relation to the response which was given to the jury’s question. Leave under r 4 should be refused in relation to this ground.
	


Conviction appeal - Ground 4: The verdict was unreasonable or unsafe


	
	By ground 4, the appellant submits that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable. The question that submission raises for this Court is not whether it was possible for the jury to reach a different conclusion on the evidence as to whether the appellant was guilty of murder. It is whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied of his guilt beyond reasonable doubt or, focussing on the circumstance in which it was not open to the jury to be so satisfied, “whether the jury must, as distinct from might, have entertained a doubt about the appellant’s guilt”: Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559 at [113] (Hayne J, Gleeson CJ and Heydon J relevantly agreeing), citing M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 492-493.
	
	
	Accepting that the appellant voluntarily shot the deceased (including three times at close range into his head or neck), it was plainly open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant committed the deliberate act which caused death and in doing so, had an intention to kill the deceased. In order to find the appellant guilty of murder, in circumstances where self-defence was an issue, the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant did not in fact believe that shooting the deceased was necessary in order to defend himself. By this ground, the appellant submits that, in the face of his evidence, including as to the timing and sequence of the shots, the jury must have entertained a doubt as to his not having that belief, which was a matter for the Crown to prove.
	
	
	The appellant’s evidence (see [11] above) was that when the initial altercation occurred he was standing in front of his vehicle to the right of the driver’s side, so that the driver’s door, which was slightly open, was behind him. Following the attack on him, the appellant was left on the ground in that position. He then saw the deceased put his hand towards his right pocket, that being the pocket in which he had earlier seen the deceased place his gun. The appellant then “semi-crawled” from his position on the ground towards the vehicle and around the driver’s side door. He opened that door further, retrieved his gun from under the driver’s seat and, holding that gun in his left hand (he was left-handed), stood up and walked around the open door towards the deceased, who was still standing in front of the vehicle where he had been whilst the appellant was being attacked on the ground.
	
	
	As he approached the deceased, the appellant raised and straightened his left arm in front of him so that the muzzle of the weapon was very close to or touching the left side of the deceased’s head. In cross examination (see [11] above for his evidence in chief), the appellant described what then happened: (tcpt 07/03/14, pp 1048, 1051)
	


A.   I didn’t aim for his head. I got up, as soon as I stood I reached my arm out and that’s where the gun was. And I straight away started to fire until he dropped to the ground.

…

A.   I just started to fire the gun. As soon as I got up and pointed my hand towards him, I started to fire it and then the next thing he stumbled back and fell to the ground.

Q.   You must have been looking because - -

A.   At the start yes, I did, and it was at his head.


	
	The appellant maintained that, in the moments preceding his firing of the first shot and as he raised the gun, the deceased was standing in front of him and neither of the other men was running away, or had turned his back to him. His case accepted that the first shot was fired in very close proximity to the deceased’s head and that thereafter, as the deceased turned his head and body to his right and away from the direction in which the appellant was facing, the appellant continued to fire the weapon resulting in the sequence of wounds being wounds 3, 2, 1 and then 6 and 5 (as described in [31]-[36] above) with a further wound to the deceased’s left hand.
	
	
	In our view, there are significant respects in which the appellant’s evidence as to what occurred, and particularly as to what he believed when he fired the shots, is implausible. In evaluating that evidence the jury also had the distinct advantage of seeing and hearing the appellant give his account: M v The Queen at 493-494.
	
	
	First, from the appellant’s perspective, if he had believed that the deceased was reaching for a gun with the intention of shooting him, it is most unlikely that, having retrieved his own gun, he would have emerged from behind the car door, stood up, advanced towards the deceased, but not commenced firing until the gun in his outstretched left hand made contact with the left side of the deceased’s head. Had the appellant truly believed that it was necessary to shoot the deceased to avoid himself being shot, the most likely scenario is that he would have fired the gun as soon as he was in a position to do so. He was not likely to have exposed himself unnecessarily to the risk of being shot or to the risk of being attacked again by coming too close to any of the three men.
	
	
	Secondly, from the deceased’s perspective, if he had intended to shoot the appellant (and had made a move which indicated such an intention), he had ample time to remove the gun from his pocket (which was loaded with its safety catch disengaged), aim and fire it before the appellant had advanced until his gun made contact with his head.
	
	
	Thirdly, and again from the deceased’s perspective, it is not likely that he would have remained stationary and facing towards the car as the appellant secured the gun from under the seat, re-emerged from around the door with the gun in hand and straightened his arm as he approached the deceased so that the gun made contact with the left side of his head. Even allowing for the fact that the deceased initially may not have seen the gun, on the appellant’s version of events he took no evasive action whatsoever before the gun was placed against the side of his head and fired.
	
	
	Although there was evidence from Dr Orde (who was not a toxicologist) that the deceased would have been “somewhat intoxicated” due to the substances found in his system (tcpt 27/02/14, pp 434-435), the jury would have been justified in rejecting that as providing a reasonable explanation for the fact that the deceased did not react or move. The appellant’s evidence did not suggest that the deceased was confused or disorientated in such a way that he might not have been aware of what was going on around him (tcpt 07/03/14, pp 973-976). More significantly, the appellant’s evidence was that the other two men also were close-by, were in a position to see what he was doing and did not turn their backs or commence to run away before he fired the first shot (tcpt 07/03/14, pp 1038, 1048).
	
	
	Fourthly, the fact that the appellant fired six shots at the deceased including two at or close to point blank range into his head, was a clear indication of an intention to kill in circumstances where the deceased was not holding a gun and had not moved either to attack the appellant or to take evasive action. None of that is consistent with the deceased giving or continuing to give the impression that he was about to shoot or otherwise harm the appellant, as he alleged.
	
	
	These difficulties must have been apparent to the jury in their consideration of whether they were satisfied that the appellant’s version of events could not reasonably be true. They were explored in cross-examination: (tcpt 07/03/14, pp 1037-1038)
	


Q.   You made your way to a position allowing you to obtain a gun from inside the car?

A.   Yes.

Q.   With the men there close?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Did they do anything whilst you were performing a crawl, negotiating your way to the car to reach and get the gun?

A.    I don’t know.

Q.   Well, were they in a position to see you do that?

A.    Yes.

…

Q.    They stand there and just do nothing?

A.    I don’t know what they did.

Q.    They’re not striking you?

A.    No.

…

Q.    … [Y]ou were at their feet and you managed to make your way to a position where you were able to reach into a car to get a gun and they did nothing, is that right?

A.    Yeah, that’s right.

…

Q.    You would need to have moved alongside the car, under [the] car door or around the car door, back in a position so you could then reach forward into the well of the driver’s side apartment, reach under the seat --

A.    Yes.

Q.    – to obtain, feel for the gun, withdraw it, lift it, stand and start firing?

A.    Yes.


	
	The timing and sequence in which the shooting occurred was not determinative of the question whether the jury should necessarily have had a reasonable doubt as to the appellant’s not having fired the shots in self-defence.
	
	
	Mr Boutsikakis’ evidence, if accepted, would have excluded any such doubt, because it involved the appellant returning and shooting the deceased in the head. However that evidence was contradicted by the evidence of the other eye witnesses. It also included that the later shots to the head were fired from a distance of about a metre (tcpt 28/02/14, p 560), which was contrary to the forensic evidence. We conclude that the jury must at least have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the shots being fired other than in a single volley.
	
	
	Accepting that a succession of shots was fired, the expert evidence was equivocal as to whether the head shots were fired first, as the appellant maintained. The ballistics evidence explaining the absence of any damage or gouge marks on the road surface allowed for the possibility that the shots to the head were fired as the deceased lay on the roadway (see [39] above). However that evidence was also wholly consistent with the shooting having occurred as the appellant described. So too was Dr Orde’s evidence in relation to the possible explanations as to how the bullet wounds occurred (see [29] above).
	
	
	The critical question for the jury was whether they were persuaded that the appellant did not in fact believe that shooting the deceased was necessary in self-defence. Putting aside Mr Boutsikakis’ evidence, there were two remaining possible scenarios. In each a single volley of shots was fired and the deceased was shot in the head at close range.
	
	
	In answering that question, the jury did not have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to which of those two scenarios represented the fact. It was sufficient that they address whether it was not reasonably possible that the appellant believed it was necessary to shoot the deceased in the circumstances as he described them.
	
	
	In our view, it was well open to the jury to regard the appellant’s account as one which could not reasonably have reflected what actually happened and for that reason, to have rejected his evidence that he believed shooting the deceased was necessary to stop the deceased from killing him. Having regard to the implausibility of that evidence, this is not a case in which the jury necessarily must have concluded that it was reasonably possible that his belief was as he asserted.
	
	
	It is also necessary to consider briefly the question of provocation, which only operates as a partial defence reducing murder to manslaughter: Crimes Act, s 23(1) (as enacted before its repeal by the Crimes Amendment (Provocation) Act 2014 (NSW)). On the Crown case the appellant was punched and kicked by three men. In our view it was plainly open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant did not shoot the deceased as a result of any loss of self-control on his part induced by the deceased’s participation in the attack on him. His action in shooting the deceased was calculated and deliberate. He had placed a loaded gun under the seat of his car, prepared to use it if necessary. He returned to the car with the intention of retrieving the gun and using it, and he did so.
	
	
	For these reasons, this ground should be rejected.
	


Grounds of appeal against sentence


	
	Campbell J delivered his judgment as to sentence on 20 June 2014: [2014] NSWSC 829. The appellant (who we will refer to as the applicant in relation to his sentencing appeal) was sentenced to imprisonment for 26 years and 8 months with a non-parole period of 20 years with effect from 12 January 2012.
	
	
	The proposed appeal against sentence is based upon the following grounds:
	


1   The sentencing judge erred in finding that the applicant intended to kill the deceased on a basis not left to the jury at trial.

2   The sentencing judge erred in holding that there was planning and premeditation involved in the offending.

3   There was latent error whereby the sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account provocation as a mitigating factor in the determination of sentence, despite saying that he was taking this mitigating factor into account.

4   In all of the circumstances, the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.

Sentencing appeal - Ground 1: Finding an intention to kill on a basis not left to the jury


	
	The learned judge concluded that the applicant shot the deceased first at point blank range in the head and then continued to fire as the deceased stumbled and fell: [77]. He was satisfied that the applicant had an intention to kill from the first shot: [78]. As was explained at [18] above, the Crown disavowed any contention that the applicant had brought the gun to his meeting with the deceased intending from the outset to use it.
	
	
	It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that his Honour was correct to reject, as he did at [73], Mr Boutsikakis’ version of events, which involved what was described as a coup de grâce shooting into the head of the deceased after the applicant had chased Mr Leger. It was said that his Honour “should have sentenced the applicant on the basis of shooting the deceased spontaneously with an intention of inflicting grievous bodily harm”.
	
	
	In written and oral submissions by senior counsel for the applicant on sentence, the contention that his Honour should find that there was a spontaneous shooting with an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm, was not made. Rather, it was accepted that the judge should sentence on the basis of the intention to kill evident in Mr Boutsikakis’ version of events; that is, that the judge should find the initial shots were fired in self-defence, but that the later shots were fired after the applicant returned from chasing Mr Leger; were directed at close range to the deceased’s head while he was lying on the ground; and were accompanied by an intention to kill.
	
	
	To have shot the deceased a number of times in the head at point blank range when he was lying prone on the roadway would have been a most callous and heinous manner of killing. The applicant’s moral culpability for doing so would have been very high indeed. Yet that is the factual basis the applicant’s counsel at sentence advocated the judge should adopted when undertaking the sentencing task.
	
	
	His Honour was not prepared to approach the task in that fashion. He sentenced upon a less heinous and callous factual basis, namely that the applicant fired at the deceased’s head and torso in a single volley of shots. That involved accepting the applicant’s evidence as to the timing and sequence of the shots, and being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the first three shots fired at or close to point blank range were fired by the applicant, intending to kill the deceased.
	
	
	The applicant now seeks to argue that the judge should not have found an intention to kill at all; only an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. It was a matter for the applicant at sentence to persuade his Honour of this basis on the balance of probabilities. By arguing otherwise, it was implicitly conceded that such persuasion was not open.
	
	
	An appeal to this Court, which is a court of error, is not the occasion to rehear a plea in mitigation on different bases formulated by counsel who make no attempt to explain why the approach taken by a predecessor in the court below was erroneous or misguided: see, for example, Zreika v The Queen [2012] NSWCCA 44; 223 A Crim R 460 at [79] per Johnson J. In any event, the applicant has failed to establish that it was not open to the sentencing judge to find an intention to kill when the gun was discharged six times in the direction of the head and torso of the deceased at close range, some at or close to point blank range.
	
	
	There is no merit in this ground.
	


Sentencing appeal - Ground 2: Error in holding there was planning and premeditation


	
	The applicant’s written submissions in relation to this ground commence with reference to the statutory aggravating factor to be taken into account when an offence was “part of a planned or organised criminal activity”: Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), s 21A(2)(n). The sentencing judge made no reference to this factor so the point of referring to it was not clear.
	
	
	Reference was also made to the Crown Prosecutor having disavowed that there was planning or premeditation by the applicant to commit murder (see [18] above). That must be accepted; but it is not what the judge found. What the judge said was:
	


42   … [T]aking the gun portrays a level of planning or premeditation.

78   ... [I] find that: the offender went to Selmon Street to confront Todorovski; that he did so with a degree of premeditation implicit in bringing a gun he was prepared to use if necessary …

109   … [T]he degree of moral culpability in this offending was high. The offender shot his victim with a deadly weapon intending to kill him. There was an element of planning and premeditation involved in the offending. He obtained the gun and took it with him having in mind that he was prepared to use it if things turned violent as they may well, and in fact did.


	
	It was submitted that “the possibility of having to use the weapon was already encompassed by the increased gravity from the actual use of the weapon”. That ignores the fact that the applicant had the forethought to have a weapon at hand. It is one thing to use a weapon in the commission of a crime. There is an added dimension when the offender takes steps to ensure a weapon is available for use if necessary; particularly something as obviously concealable and lethal as a handgun.
	
	
	The judge did not in terms refer to this as an “aggravating factor” but it is implicit that he regarded it as something that enhanced the seriousness of the offence. There was no error in doing so.
	
	
	There is no merit in this ground.
	


Sentencing appeal - Ground 3: Error in failing to take provocation into account


	
	The applicant referred to the judge having expressly stated on three occasions that he was taking provocation into account in mitigation of sentence. His Honour qualified this by saying that the relevant provocation fell ""well short of the legal requirements of the partial defence"" and that he would take it into account by way of mitigation ""to a degree"": [13], [89], [113]. The provocation of which the judge was satisfied was that, in retrieving the gun and firing at the deceased, the applicant was retaliating for having just been assaulted.
	
	
	The applicant’s argument was that the sentence imposed failed to reflect this provocation, such that it may be inferred that it was not taken into account despite what the judge said. We are not prepared to do other than accept the judge at his word. Whether the sentence appropriately reflected the finding as to provocation is a matter relevant to the next ground. This ground must be rejected.
	


Sentencing appeal - Ground 4: The sentence is manifestly excessive


	
	The applicant submitted that a sentence involving a non-parole period of 20 years (it is unclear why the focus was upon the non-parole period) “demonstrably failed to take into account the finding that the applicant was operating under provocation falling short of provocation for manslaughter”. A further submission was that “the findings of the sentencing judge, including the very short period of time over which the events unfolded, the discount for facilitating the course of justice [which the judge described at [125] as being ""something in the order of 12 months""] and the subjective case of the applicant, including provocation, evidence latent error in the sentence”.
	
	
	A schedule of cases involving sentencing for murder was annexed to the applicant’s written submissions and said to support a finding of manifest excess. No submission was made as to how that was so and it is not self-evident.
	
	
	This was a serious example of murder. There was undoubtedly an intention to kill by an offender who brought a loaded pistol to a confrontation, albeit not, at that time, with an intention to use it to kill but rather to have it readily at hand in case it was required. And, as the sentencing judge found, there was ""a high level of actual public danger"" given the shooting occurred in broad daylight in a residential suburban street at holiday time with many people in the vicinity: [110]. The judge was also correct to have regard to the prevalence of gun crime and the community concern about ""the threat [guns] pose to public safety and the maintenance of peace in our society"": [111]
	
	
	There was no challenge to the judge's finding that the applicant's moral culpability was ""high"". And it was appropriate for his Honour to have regard to the maximum penalty of life imprisonment and the standard non-parole period of 20 years as ""important guideposts for fixing the appropriate penalty"": [100].
	
	
	Such provocation as there might have been was of a kind that the applicant might have expected. Given his recent dealings with the deceased, and what he was given to understand about the deceased’s attitude towards him, the applicant could hardly have thought that the pair were going to have a “fireside chat”. If provocation was a mitigating factor at all, which we doubt, it should only have had a very minimal impact upon the sentence imposed.
	
	
	The schedule of cases annexed to the applicant’s submissions do not support a conclusion that the sentence was manifestly excessive. They involve offending in a wide variety of circumstances and some by persons who, unlike the applicant, had personal circumstances such as youth, mental illness or a troubled background requiring significant mitigation of penalty. In the applicant's case, it was found that ""he has not established a strong case for leniency"": [115].
	
	
	We are not persuaded that the claim of manifest excess in the sentence has been established. Rather, we are of the view that his Honour's careful approach to a difficult sentencing exercise resulted in an assessment of penalty that was well within the range of sentencing discretion for such a serious crime.
	


Conclusion


	
	Each of the grounds on which the conviction is challenged is rejected. Grounds 1, 2, and 3 involve questions of law and ground 4 involves a question of mixed law and fact. Leave to appeal should be granted in relation to ground 4. Leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to rely on grounds 2 and 3 is refused. The appeal against conviction on grounds 1 and 4 is dismissed.
	
	
	There is no merit in any of the proposed grounds of appeal against sentence. However, having regard to the length of the sentence, it is appropriate to grant leave. The appeal against sentence is dismissed.
	


Orders


	
	We make the following orders:
	



	
	Appeal against conviction dismissed.
	
	
	Leave to appeal against sentence granted but the appeal dismissed.

		09 March 2016",2016-03-08 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2241420,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 28) [2016] NSWSC 160,"Judgment EX-TEMPORE (REVISED)


	
	The Crown has called William Duff as a witness in its case, from whose evidence a series of issues have arisen. Those issues are four in number and in order to place them in their proper context it is necessary for me to summarise aspects of Mr Duff's evidence.
	
	
	Mr Duff was called by the Crown yesterday and his evidence commences at T1351. He said, amongst other things, that he was a friend of the accused Rogerson and that he had spoken with him in 2012 about private investigation work. He explained that this was a general conversation in which Rogerson had told him that he was doing some work with the co-accused McNamara.
	
	
	Mr Duff said that between 2012 and 2014 he had seen McNamara on two occasions, both of which were in the latter's capacity as a private investigator. Mr Duff also explained that he was part of a group who would gather at the Crown Hotel at Revesby on Thursday afternoons, although he explained that he did not attend each week and that the frequency of his visits to the hotel with that group (of which the accused Rogerson at least appears to have been a member) was about every month during 2013 and 2014.
	
	
	At T1352 L29 the Crown Prosecutor specifically took Mr Duff to 20 May 2014, which was the date on which the deceased was murdered. The Crown asked Mr Duff whether he recalled receiving a telephone call from Rogerson at about 9.15am on that day. Mr Duff responded in the affirmative. When asked whether or not he could remember any details of the conversation, Mr Duff said that he couldn't, that it was ""just another phone call really,"" and that he did recall the accused Rogerson saying that he would ""call in at some stage if he had time"".
	
	
	When asked whether or not he recalled seeing Rogerson on that day, Mr Duff responded (at T1352 L48) ""I don't believe I did"". He went on to explain (commencing at T1353 L2) that he held some belief that he had in fact seen the accused on 15 May 2014 and that if the accused had called in to his premises it would have been on that day.
	
	
	At that point the Crown foreshadowed, but subsequently withdrew, an application for leave to cross-examine Mr Duff under s. 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (“the Act”). The Crown then asked Mr Duff whether or not he was able to specify what day Rogerson had called on him. He indicated that he was not able to do so. He then said (at T1353 L28) that on whatever day Rogerson had called to see him, he had arrived at approximately 3.30pm in the afternoon, and left at approximately 5.30pm.
	
	
	At that point the evidence-in-chief was completed. Taken by itself the evidence appeared, to me at least, to have been of little significance.
	
	
	Mr Duff was then cross-examined by Ms Shead, who appears for McNamara. He said that he had been a friend of Rogerson since about 1986. The cross-examination then turned, after some period of time, to the circumstances in which he had made a statement to the police. In particular, Mr Duff was asked (at T1367 L44) whether or not he remembered sending an email to a Detective Sheehy from the New South Wales Police on 4 June 2014. That email, and some attachments to it, subsequently became exhibit M11.
	
	
	Ultimately Mr Duff made a statement to the police, although that did not occur until 17 November 2015.
	
	
	I do not propose to set out in full the contents of exhibit M11, but there are aspects of it which do warrant some reference. On the second page of the document, Mr Duff asserted that on 20 May 2014 he was at home suffering from severe pain and that at 9.15am he received a phone call from Rogerson. He went on to say that late on the afternoon of 20 May 2014, Rogerson arrived at his home. Mr Duff said that Rogerson stayed there for a considerable amount of time and that he would have left between about 5:15pm and 5:30pm. The last document attached to exhibit M11 is a separate document headed ""Phone calls on 20th"". The document details calls received and made by Mr Duff on 20 May 2014.
	
	
	The significance of exhibit M11, it would seem, is that although the covering email made reference to Mr Duff making amendments to the information that he had previously given to the police, those amendments did not include any amendment to the date on which Rogerson is said to have visited him at his home. In particular, there is no reference in any of the correspondence contained within exhibit M11 that Rogerson visited Mr Duff on 15 May 2014 as opposed to 20 May 2014.
	
	
	Mr Duff (agreed at T1370 L22) that exhibit M11 contained a very detailed description of his claimed interaction with Rogerson on 20 May 2014. When asked (at T1370 L39) when it was that he first told anybody that 15 May 2014 was the date on which Rogerson had come to see him, he said that he had informed the police when his statement had been taken from him at the Bass Hill Police Station.
	
	
	Ms Shead then took Mr Duff to various passages of his statement of 17 November 2015. Having been taken specifically to paragraphs 11, 12, 13 and 14, Mr Duff accepted that there was no reference in that statement to any event having occurred on 15 May 2014. When it was put to him that he had not told anybody about any events occurring that day until giving evidence before this Court, Mr Duff responded (at T1372 L2) that that was not correct. He went on to explain (commencing T1372 L5) that he had spoken to one of the police and had told that officer that he believed that Rogerson’s visit had occurred on 15 May 2014. When asked (at L23) to state the name of the police officer he so informed, Mr Duff responded that he had ""mentioned it"" to “Mr Phillips”. The reference to ""Mr Phillips"" is obviously a reference to Detective Phillips, who is the officer-in-charge of the investigation.
	
	
	When asked whether he had told Detective Phillips that Rogerson had come to his home on 15 May 2014, Mr Duff responded (at T1372 L29):
	


""No, I said I may have, I didn't say to Mr Phillips it was on that day, it was may have"".


	
	When asked (in the following question) whether he nominated the date of 15 May 2014 to Detective Phillips, Mr Duff responded:
	


""Yes, I said I believe it may have been the 15th, not the 20th"".


	
	He reiterated that proposition in an answer to a question commencing at T1372 L48.
	
	
	There was further cross-examination about Mr Duff’s assertion regarding particular dates commencing at T1375 L50. The cross-examination then continued and culminated in a proposition being put to Mr Duff (commencing at T1381 L36) regarding a conversation that he had with a police officer on 17 August 2014. Mr Duff was unable to recall that event and said that he did not know the name of the police officer to whom reference was made. It was suggested to him that there was a reference in that conversation to him working after being ""disengaged"" from the Police Force. He responded by saying that he did not understand the import of that question, and did not recall any conversation which included words to that effect.
	
	
	The following question was then put by Ms Shead (at T1382 L1):
	


“Q. I suggest that you said words to this effect: On the day of the murder, Roger Rogerson had contacted you by phone in search of what you believed to be an alibi, that you were upset and you said, 'I'm filthy at him, he called me on the day, and I believe he was looking for an alibi.'“


	
	That question was met with an immediate objection by counsel for Rogerson, Mr Thomas. There was some short argument which followed at the end of yesterday's proceedings. I invited Ms Shead to reflect on the matter overnight and to renew any necessary debate this morning.
	
	
	Before leaving that last issue, it is appropriate for me to note that a document which is now MFI 67 has been provided to me in the course of argument. That document clearly forms the basis of the question which was put as set out in [18]. Having made reference to each of the accused and Mr Duff, the document reads as follows:
	


“All three PN or S are ex-New South Wales police officers. Two of which have been charged with a recent homicide/drug supply matter. At the above date and time police attended (Duff's) household in relation to a welfare check in accordance with operation Talon. During the visit (Duff's) queried with this check had anything to do with the recent arrest and charge of (Rogerson) and (McNamara). (Duff) went on to say that he knows both (Rogerson) and (McNamara). He said that he had only ""worked"" with (Rogerson) on the same investigation but never worked side-by-side with either officer. He said that on the day of the murder (Rogerson) had contacted him by phone in search of what he believed was an alibi and that he (Duff) was upset. He said, 'I'm filthy at him. He called me on the day. I believed he was looking for an alibi.'“


	
	When the proceedings resumed this morning, the issues arising from the evidence of Mr Duff expanded considerably from the position as it had been left on the previous day. There are now four issues, namely:
	



	
	whether the question put by Ms Shead, to which Mr Thomas objected, should be allowed;
	
	
	whether, as a consequence of that question being put, the jury should be discharged (Mr Thomas having made that application);
	
	
	whether Ms Shead should be permitted to cross-examine Mr Duff as to his credit; and
	
	
	whether the Crown should be given leave to cross-examine Mr Duff under s. 38 of the Act.
	



	
	I will deal with those issues separately.
	
	
	I turn to the first issue arising from the question put by Ms Shead (commencing at T1382 L1) which is based on the contents of MFI 67. Providing the necessary relevance can be established, it may be open to counsel to cross-examine Mr Duff as to a conversation he is said to have had with Mr Rogerson. However in my view, it is not open to counsel to seek to elicit evidence of Mr Duff's belief as to the import, or meaning, of what was said in any such conversation. In my view, Mr Duff's belief is not relevant. Such a belief essentially amounts to little more than his interpretation of what was said to him.
	
	
	Whether or not the content of the conversation, if given in evidence, may provide a basis for a submission to be made to the jury at the end of the case is of course another matter entirely. However, I do not propose to allow the question that has been put.
	
	
	The second issue, namely the application made by Mr Thomas that the jury be discharged, arises from Ms Shead’s question. Mr Thomas submitted that the question, of itself, is highly prejudicial in its terms and such prejudice was exacerbated by the fact that (paraphrasing what Mr Thomas said) the question carried with it the “imprimatur” of cross-examining counsel. Given the conclusion that I have reached in relation to the question, the issue of Mr Duff's beliefs as to what the accused Rogerson was attempting to do will not be further pursued. The question, as I have indicated, will be disallowed.
	
	
	When the question was put, Mr Thomas was quick to object to it. There was therefore a single reference to the subject matter contained within it. In all of those circumstances, I am not satisfied that any prejudice arises from the fact that the question was put. To the extent that any prejudice may arise, it can, in my view, be properly cured by the jury being reminded (inter alia) that questions are not evidence and that the question has been disallowed, and that the contents of it should be disregarded. For those reasons, I dismiss the application to discharge the jury.
	
	
	Turning to the third issue, Ms Shead foreshadowed this morning (for the first time) that she wished to cross-examine Mr Duff in relation to his criminal history. That history has been provided to me for the purposes of determining this application. It discloses the fact that on 11 December 1997 Mr Duff was sentenced to a term of imprisonment in respect of a charge of supplying a prohibited drug, namely heroin. He was sentenced to a minimum term of 18 months imprisonment commencing on 31 October 1997, with an additional term of 18 months imprisonment. His sentence was expressed to expire on 30 October 2000. A subsequent appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal was dismissed on 17 September 1998. The offence of supplying a prohibited drug had been committed in January of 1994, almost four years prior to Mr Duff being sentenced.
	
	
	Ms Shead's application to cross-examine on this material is governed by the provisions of s. 103 of the Act which is in the following terms:
	


103 Exception: cross-examination as to credibility

(1) The credibility rule does not apply to evidence adduced in cross-examination of a witness if the evidence could substantially affect the assessment of the credibility of the witness.

(2) Without limiting the matters to which the court may have regard for the purposes of subsection (1), it is to have regard to:

(a) whether the evidence tends to prove that the witness knowingly or recklessly made a false representation when the witness was under an obligation to tell the truth, and

(b) the period that has elapsed since the acts or events to which the evidence relates were done or occurred.


	
	Section 103 has been the subject of judicial consideration on a number of occasions. The Crown referred me, in particular, to the judgment of Santow JA in R v El-Azzi (2004) NSWCCA 455. In that case (at [181]) his Honour made reference to an earlier decision of R v RPS (unreported) NSWCCA 13 August 1997 where Hunt CJ at CL, with the concurrence of Gleeson CJ and Hidden J, observed (inter alia) that evidence as to conduct which is adduced in cross-examination must have substantial probative value, in the sense that it could rationally affect the assessment of the witness. His Honour concluded (at [183]):
	


“In my opinion, for this evidence to have had substantial probative value within the meaning of s 103(1), it must have had the potential to have a real bearing upon the assessment of the appellant's obvious credibility - and, particularly, to the appellant's credibility in relation to the evidence that he had given, or would give at the trial. It cannot have had substantial probative value for the purposes of s 103(1) unless it was capable in a significant way, of bearing upon that assessment.”


	
	A number of other authorities establish that it is difficult, if not impossible, to lay down fixed guidelines as to the application of s. 103. Necessarily, a determination of whether or not cross-examination as to credit ought be allowed must be case, and evidence, specific. However, in determining such an application, s. 103 mandates that I have regard to the matters set out in subs (2), although those matters are not exhaustive.
	
	
	The first of those matters, set out in s. 103(2)(a), is whether or not the evidence tends to prove that the witness knowingly or recklessly made a false representation when the witness was under an obligation to tell the truth. In the circumstances of the present case, the fact of Mr Duff's prior conviction does not, in my view, tend to prove any such thing.
	
	
	The second matter, set out in s. 103(2)(b), requires that I take into account the period that has elapsed since the acts or events to which the evidence relates were done or occurred. I have already observed that the offence committed by Mr Duff was in January of 1994. That is more than 22 years ago. His sentence was imposed in December of 1997. That is more than 18 years ago. On any view, a significant period has elapsed since the offence was committed, and since Mr Duff was sentenced. The magnitude of that period, in my view, tends against granting the present application.
	
	
	It follows that in my view the two mandatory factors set out in subs (2) of s. 103 do not support the application being quashed, and in fact tend directly against it.
	
	
	I do not accept the proposition advanced by Mr Thomas that if the cross-examination were permitted it would, in effect, amount to a ""back door"" attack on the credibility of Rogerson. The real issue is whether cross-examination as to that matter would have substantial probative value in the sense that it could rationally affect the assessment of the credit of Mr Duff.
	
	
	There is, as I have outlined something of a discrepancy in one aspect of Mr Duff's evidence. It is apparent that he initially told the police that he saw the accused Rogerson on 20 May 2014. He now seeks to resile from that by asserting that it in fact occurred on 15 May 2014. There is, therefore, an issue about the reliability of that aspect of his evidence. However, whilst not exhaustive, the two mandatory factors set out in s 103(2) both tend against the application being granted. I have also taken into account the fact that the activity which led to Mr Duff's conviction, although obviously unlawful and of the utmost seriousness, was not an offence of dishonesty.
	
	
	That is not to say, of course, that only offences which are properly described as offences of dishonesty will attract the application of s. 103. However, in all of the circumstances, I am not satisfied that the evidence of a conviction relating to conduct which occurred more than 20 years ago, of the nature of the kind that I have outlined, is capable of bearing in any significant way upon an assessment of Mr Duff's credit. I therefore do not propose to allow that cross-examination.
	
	
	The fourth and final issue concerns the Crown's application to cross-examine Mr Duff pursuant to s. 38 of the Act. There was, as I have indicated, a previous application made by the Crown under s. 38 (albeit in relation to a different issue) which was not pursued. The present application arises, it seems, from the evidence given by Mr Duff at T1372 L33. In the course of cross-examination, when asked whether he had nominated the date of 15 May 2014 as opposed to 20 May 2014 as the relevant date to Detective Phillips, Mr Duff responded.
	


""Yes, I said that I believe it may have been the 15th, not the 20th"".


	
	Detective Phillips gave evidence before me earlier today. He was asked by the Crown:
	


“Q. What I wanted to specifically ask you or direct your attention to, sir, is did Mr Duff ever say to you that 'I believe it may have been 15 May 2014, not the 20th, that Roger Rogerson came to see me'?

A. No, he did not.

Q. Not at any time?

A. No.”


	
	The evidence of Detective Phillips in this regard is obviously at odds with that of Mr Duff. It is on that basis that the Crown has sought leave to cross-examine Mr Duff under s. 38. In making that application the Crown has also drawn my attention to the provisions of s. 106 of the Act, which creates an exception to the credibility rule in respect of evidence of rebutting a previous denial.
	
	
	It is not necessary for me to canvass the history of the enactment of s. 38. It is sufficient for present purposes to observe that the section materially alters the previous position as it stood at common law. The authorities establish that the word ""unfavourable"" as it is used in the section is to be given a wide meaning.
	
	
	In my view, the evidence given by Mr Duff (at T1372 L33) is “unfavourable”. It is also contradicted by the evidence of Detective Phillips. I have taken into account the mandatory considerations in s. 38(6). In my view, the application ought be granted, limited to that area that the Crown has defined.
	
	
	It is not appropriate for me, at this stage, to resolve the question of the application of s 106. It seems to me that the application of that section will ultimately depend on what answers are given by Mr Duff to such questions as may be put to him in cross-examination. The application under s. 106 can therefore be deferred until such time as it may arise, which will presumably be in the course of further evidence given by Detective Phillips.

		15 June 2016",2016-02-29 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2241437,R v Merrick [2016] NSWSC 163,"ex tempore Judgment


	
	This morning before this Court the accused, Ross Albert Merrick, was arraigned upon an indictment that charges him with the murder of Marika Ninness on 21 December 2013 at New Lambton Heights. On arraignment, the accused entered a plea of not guilty to that charge.
	
	
	His counsel moved upon a notice of motion previously filed with the Court. The motion seeks orders that the venue of the trial be changed. Specifically, what is sought is that the Court change the venue for the current trial to the Supreme Court sitting in Sydney, that the trial date for today be vacated and the matter be further listed to fix a fresh trial date in Sydney.
	
	
	In support of the motion, the accused has tendered and asked to have read two affidavits and a number of annexures to those affidavits. The first of the affidavits is one sworn and filed by the accused’s solicitor, Mr Felton. That affidavit annexes a number of documents, all of which appear to be printouts or downloads from a social media site, Facebook. The second of the affidavits upon which the accused seeks to rely is an affidavit of his mother, Cathy Moss, dated 3 February 2016. Ms Moss also refers to and annexes to her affidavit some documentary material, part of it from Facebook and part of being copies of correspondence. I will return to the detail of the evidence shortly.
	
	
	The Crown did not require either deponent for cross-examination.
	
	
	The accused’s contention, broadly, is that, because of posts or entries made on Facebook, he would not be able to receive a fair trial if his trial were to be held in the Newcastle area. The argument is that there is a basis upon which to conclude that the Facebook posts irretrievably give rise to a perception in the reasonable and fair-minded observer that the accused could be tried by persons potentially infected with bias against him.
	
	
	Of course, when considering that test, one must import another feature to the fair-minded and reasonable lay observer, and that is that that person is assumed to have knowledge of the relevant considerations that the tribunal would ultimately have regard to in determining the matter before it.
	
	
	Returning to the evidence upon which the accused relies, principally, as I have indicated, consisting of posts to the Facebook social media platform. The annexures to Mr Felton’s affidavit, annexures A, B, C and D, are printouts of posts made by various people. The posts refer to a number of matters connected with or concerning the current trial, the accused, and the murder with which he is charged. There are references in the material to bail laws, complaints that the accused should not be on bail or, more specifically, a complaint that no person charged with murder should be admitted to bail. There are references to the accused’s apparent employment as a male stripper. There is reference to events before the Court, that is, the adjournment of the matter and various other orders made by the Court from time to time. There are complaints about the delay and the time it takes to “get justice”. There are references to the accused making up what are described as “bullshit stories” to “get off” the charge. There are references to him, being on some other social media platform, referred to as Tinder, and “picking up girls”. There are comments about possible violence to another partner nominated as Alice, and there are derogatory comments which deride the accused personally.
	
	
	The posts appear to be made amidst or between a closed group of people. There seem to be about thirty people who have participated in the discussion on Facebook. Some of them have been identified as being either former or perhaps serving police officers. One, having a closer relationship to the deceased, has been identified as a former employee of the Department of Attorney-General and Justice.
	
	
	Ms Moss’ affidavit refers to the same material as that contained in Mr Felton’s affidavit and additionally sets out some steps that she has taken to complain about the conduct of someone who she believes to be a police officer. There is some correspondence with the Police Integrity Commission concerning that complaint and some information about steps that were taken by the relevant authorities in relation to Ms Moss’ complaint to the Police Integrity Commission.
	
	
	There is no evidence tendered on behalf of the accused as to the operation of the Facebook platform. It is not clear to me on the evidence how many people could have access to these posts or, indeed, how one would go about accessing these posts. It would appear from the evidence that the material is only able to be seen by someone who is what is known as a “friend”, some sort of status or approval which, I infer, gives access to other people to read posts made by particular individuals.
	
	
	In the absence of any specific evidence of the operation of Facebook, and it not being something about which I consider I either should take judicial knowledge or indeed can, since I have no knowledge of the platform myself, it is only possible for the Court to infer who can access this material and in what circumstances. It appears that the material is not open to all and any user of Facebook but only to those who have a particular status or membership of a particular group denoted by the term “friend”.
	
	
	The posts themselves do not suggest that there is widespread distribution of this material. It seems to be about thirty people who have had some input into the Facebook discussion, although there are some entries which refer to larger numbers of people as “liking” the post. Most of those who have made a specific comment or entry to the site are identifiable either by their name or their photograph which, on the evidence, accompanies the posts that have been made. On the evidence, the number of people who have actually accessed this material seems to be very small.
	
	
	The accused argues that Facebook posts or posts in the nature of those in this present matter are far more insidious than news media reports of a more conventional type because it is not possible to track who might see such material and be influenced by it. The accused contends that his trial will be irredeemably prejudiced or, at the least, will appear to the reasonable and fair-minded observer to have been so. The accused refers the Court to the High Court decision of Webb and Hay v The Queen [1994] HCA 30; 181 CLR 41. That is a decision which deals with an application for a discharge of a juror on the grounds of potential partiality and it sets out the test that traditionally is applied to applications for disqualification on the basis of either actual or apprehended bias. That test is well settled and I do not need to set it out in any great detail here. It is that which is commonly known as the reasonable and fair-minded observer test.
	
	
	In disavowing those cases which relate to media publicity of a more common kind, no reference has been made by Ms Evers to some of the decisions which ordinarily one would consider to be apposite to an application of this nature: The Queen v Glennon [1992] HCA 16; (1992) 173 CLR 592; another is R v Milat CCA 60438/96 [1998] NSWSC 795. It seems to me that the ultimate question is whether the accused can receive a fair trial in Newcastle and be seen to receive a fair trial, having regard to the evidence placed before the Court which is relied upon to establish that he cannot.
	
	
	Having considered all of the Facebook material and the other evidence relied upon by the accused, I am not persuaded that the evidence in fact establishes that there is any real threat to the integrity of the trial if held in Newcastle.
	
	
	Ordinarily, criminal offences should be tried in the area in which they are said to arise. That is the best way of ensuring that justice is not only done but is seen to be done.
	
	
	The accused is to be tried by a jury of 12 and, in part, therein lies the solution to any possible prejudice that could arise as a result of Facebook posts.
	
	
	The first thing to be noted is that the Facebook posts, on the evidence tendered, seem to be fairly restricted. Those actively commenting are limited in number and the majority are capable of being identified. There is no evidence to suggest that these posts have been widely seen and would in fact have the sort of prejudicial effect that the accused contends because of a potentially widespread readership.
	
	
	Being on notice of this material and, in any event, proceeding to empanelment in the usual course, it is open to the Court to raise the issue of Facebook communications with the jury panel and have any person who has been a participant or a reader of posts on Facebook concerning either the accused or the forthcoming trial to identify themselves. That would be one means of disqualifying persons who have some knowledge of these proceedings via Facebook.
	
	
	The next is in the fact that the Facebook authors by and large are readily identifiable. Were any one of the persons who has posted to Facebook on the jury panel and ultimately called as one of the 12 selected for duty, knowledge of the posts would, I think, give either or both parties a sufficient basis of either preemptory challenge but, more particularly, challenge for cause and, again, that measure would lead to the disqualification of persons who could potentially have a prejudiced view.
	
	
	The Court does, as a matter of routine, and would in this particular trial, give strong directions and warnings to the jury once empanelled and throughout the trial, and prior to the jury considering its verdict, that the jury members disregard anything they may have read in any media service, whether that be the daily newspapers, printed or digital, or entries on a social media platform.
	
	
	In any criminal trial, and particularly a criminal trial that has any notoriety, there is always a danger that a juror could have irrelevant information, information not tendered by one of the parties or, indeed, prejudicial information concerning an accused or the crime that is being tried. It is the traditional method of the Court to deal with that potential risk by giving directions to the jury. The courts must proceed on the basis that jurors will listen to directions that they are given, abide by those directions and apply the directions when it comes to determining their verdict.
	
	
	Jurors in a criminal trial have a great responsibility placed upon them. The courts endeavour to give them the tools to fulfil their responsibility and to do it in a way that complies with the dictates of justice. The corollary of that is that the Court must be able to proceed on the basis that jurors and juries will discharge their great responsibilities with the care that is required of them and disregarding extraneous information.
	
	
	Here the evidence does not, in my view, establish any particular risk that vast numbers of people have seen these particular posts. Those that have can be weeded out of the jury that will ultimately be sworn and charged to try this case by the methods that I have already referred to. Should it be that there is ultimately a juror who may have some knowledge of the matter through ordinary press coverage, that also, in my view, can be dealt with by appropriate direction.
	
	
	For my part, I do not see that there is any real distinction between the prejudice that could flow from entries on a social platform, as opposed to the daily coverage that one might see in the ordinary news media, whether it be print, electronic or radio. This case probably received a degree of media attention, with reports of the proceedings before the Court and so forth, and it may be assumed that at least some in the panel may have seen those press reports. They will be told to disregard that information and the Court must operate on the basis that they will do as they are directed.
	
	
	Social media websites of the nature of Facebook are not restricted to a local area. The Internet is international, global, and it would appear that, regardless of an individual’s geographic location, anyone having the status of “friend” and able to access this material can do so, whether they be in Newcastle, in Sydney or, as indeed one of the participants appears to have been, in Queensland. In that sense, the geographic location of the trial cannot really address the risk that is said to arise here. A Sydney person with access to this material as a “friend” could see it in the same way as a resident in the Newcastle area could access and see the material as a “friend”. A change of venue would not resolve any potential issue arising from that.
	
	
	What does and will resolve any issue that may arise is the empanelment process to which I have already referred, and the directions which the Court can and will give to any tribunal of fact. On that basis, I am not persuaded that there is any risk that this trial will not be fair to the accused or that the reasonable observer, fully informed of all of the facts of the matter, and a fair-minded individual, would conclude that the accused’s trial was so prejudiced as to be unable to proceed in the local area.
	
	
	On that basis, the application is refused and the motion is dismissed.

		01 April 2016",2016-02-28 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2241531,R v Towney (No 2) [2016] NSWSC 97,"Judgment


	
	At Orange on 1 February 2016 Trent Towney was arraigned before me on a charge that he did murder John Frail at Gilgandra on 20 July 2013. He pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty of manslaughter.
	
	
	A jury of twelve was empanelled but on the second day of the trial I discharged one juror. This juror informed the Court initially by message through the Sheriff’s officer and subsequently on oath when I examined him that he had a tenuous connection with the family of the deceased. Before selection, whilst he was a member of the panel in waiting, the juror in question had heard the names of the accused, the deceased and the potential witnesses. Those names were announced by the Crown. The prosecutor also gave the panel a brief outline of the Crown case before selection commenced.
	
	
	This juror had not sought to be excused at that time because he did not realise the connection to the deceased’s family of a person known to him. That realisation came when the person concerned entered the gallery of the Court, after the Crown had opened, to listen to the evidence.
	
	
	I discharged the juror because he declared expressly on oath that he did not feel able to bring a detached judgment to the case. For reasons given on 2 February 2016 I ordered that the trial continue with 11 jurors. The jury brought in a verdict of guilty on the single count of murder on 11 February 2016 after about an hour and 50 minutes of deliberation.
	


Circumstances of the murder


	
	The Crown case which must be taken to have been accepted in full was as follows. On 19 July 2013 and into the early hours of 20 July the offender hosted a gathering of friends and relatives at his house at 200 Warren Road Gilgandra. This house is on the corner of Warren Road and Federation Street in that town. The offender was born 15 October 1992 and was therefore 20 years old at the time. Up to about 20 people of similar age and younger were present at times during the evening and into the early hours of Saturday 20 July 2013.
	
	
	John Frail attended the gathering during the late evening of Friday 19 July 2013 but left not long after midnight. At that time the offender’s girlfriend Jade Hunt and his sister Karah Towney were present. Karah is 11 months older than the offender. These young women thought that John Frail was behaving strangely, pacing about. He asked Karah Towney personal questions and made both her and Jade Hunt feel uncomfortable. He left the party after midnight because they asked him to. He was then apparently well affected by alcohol. The offender was made aware that John Frail was being asked to leave.
	
	
	Shortly before 3am on 20 July John Frail returned to 200 Warren Road. He knocked loudly at the front door and when it was answered by Karah Towney he insisted that he be readmitted. Karah Towney refused. Pushing and shoving developed between these two. John Frail seized Karah Towney’s arm. She punched him on the cheek.
	
	
	This commotion brought the offender to the front door. He accused John Frail of having hit his sister. Despite Karah Towney telling her brother loudly that she was all right the offender engaged in a fist fight with John Frail outside the front of the house. This progressed onto the surface of the road onto which the offender’s house faced.
	
	
	John Frail was a young man of 21 years at the time, his date of birth was 28 January 1992. Both he and the offender stripped off their shirts and traded blows. Karah Towney and two other young women came between them and tried to separate them. This fist fight ceased when Trent Towney turned from it with words to the effect “Wait here” and “I will get a knife.”
	
	
	He went swiftly back inside his house to a kitchen bench, a distance of some 25 metres. There he took a knife from a collection of knives in a block on the bench. The knife chosen was about 30 centimetres long overall with a blade of about 20 centimetres. He turned and went back out through the front door towards John Frail. As the offender went through the house to fetch this knife and as he returned with it a young friend, Brody Roach, implored him to “calm down” and to “stop.” But the offender continued with deliberation.
	
	
	By the time the offender re‑emerged from the front door of his house Karah Towney had prevailed upon John Frail to leave the area. John Frail walked east from the location of the fist fight and stepped over a metal traffic barrier on to Federation Street. He began to cross that road. He called out from the roadway to the others present “Tell Trent I will be back in the morning to have a proper go”, or something to that effect.
	
	
	John Frail had walked about 10 or 12 metres from the location of the fist fight when the offender, pursuing him quickly, leapt over the traffic barrier. He caught up to the deceased on the roadway of Federation Street and stabbed him repeatedly. The fatal wound was inflicted to the right side of John Frail’s neck. The blade passed through the neck at an angle into the left lung. It severed the right and left carotid arteries and the trachea. It partially transected the oesophagus and the aorta. This necessarily fatal wound was approximately 17 centimetres deep, nearly the full length of the blade used to inflict it.
	
	
	Given that John Frail was standing upright when he received this wound it must have been delivered by the knife being raised overhead and plunged downward off the vertical. Two close by eye witnesses described such a stabbing action by the offender, as his first strike when he closed on John Frail. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the first strike and that it was as described.
	
	
	Two further injuries were inflicted by two further knife strokes, one to the deceased’s right bicep and one to his right forearm. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that these arm wounds were not inflicted by the same stroke as that which resulted in the neck wound. I do not see how this would be possible and there were eye witness accounts of multiple knife strokes.
	
	
	Mortally wounded John Frail moved on across Federation Street. He collapsed against the wall of the building on the far side. Police and ambulance officers arrived within a few minutes in response to an emergency call from Karah Towney but John Frail could not be saved. He died soon after. Post mortem examination showed that he had had a blood alcohol content of 0.227 grams per 100 millilitres of blood when he was attacked and killed.
	
	
	Having inflicted the stab wounds the offender went back inside his house still carrying the knife. Jade Hunt washed the blade. The offender went to bed and slept. When woken and arrested next morning by Sergeant Tighe of the Dubbo detectives he claimed not to remember the events of the previous evening.
	


Provocation and loss of control rejected


	
	The offender neither gave evidence nor called any witness in his defence. His counsel cross-examined the Crown witnesses, most of whom had been guests at the party at 200 Warren Road, to try to create a foundation for the partial defence of provocation. In closing address defence counsel submitted that the jury would not be satisfied the Crown had excluded a reasonable possibility that John Frail’s conduct, upon his return to the party, had provoked the offender and caused him to lose his self control to the point of forming an intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm to the deceased.
	
	
	The law of provocation applicable to the case was s 23 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) in the form it took before the Crimes Amendment (Provocation) Act 2014 (NSW) came into force from 13 June 2014. The jury were directed accordingly. Their verdict shows that they either found that there was no reasonable possibility that the alleged provocative conduct relied upon by the offender had caused him to lose self control or that there was no reasonable possibility that the provocative conduct could have caused a reasonable person, in the offender’s position, to lose control.
	
	
	The putative provocation was identified in defence counsel’s final address. He relied upon the deceased having loudly and aggressively pressed to be readmitted to the party, having refused to leave when rebuffed at the front door by Karah Towney and having instead become involved in a physical clash with her. Defence counsel also referred to John Frail having engaged in the fist fight with the offender and thereafter, as contended by counsel, having loitered on Federation Street instead of departing the area.
	
	
	In this last respect defence counsel relied upon evidence of Rebecca Trudgett. She said that after the fist fight John Frail stood in front of 200 Warren Road and that he and the offender yelled at each other. I reject that evidence. It is inconsistent with the evidence of every other witness. All of the others said that John Frail moved away onto Federation Street after the fist fight stopped. He must have done so for the final deadly clash to have taken place where it did. All the other witnesses described John Frail having called back only one comment namely, as mentioned before, “Tell Trent I’ll be back in the morning to have a proper go”. These were words of parting.
	
	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender suffered no loss of control and certainly none caused by John Frail’s actions or words. There was a conflict between John Frail and the offender which became physical when the aggression of both of them rose at the same time and they stripped off their shirts. This was a mutual conflict over a slight matter, not a one sided provocation by one of the other. The clear inference from the offender’s actions is that having fought inconclusively with his fists he resolved to end the conflict decisively in his favour by introducing a lethal weapon. The course of the offender’s action was to stride purposefully into the kitchen, deaf to the entreaties of Brody Roach, select a weapon and proceed deliberately straight back out to John Frail – who was by then plainly retreating – and immediately deliver a deadly blow to a vital part of the victim’s body. This is quite inconsistent with loss of control.
	
	
	I infer from these actions as the only rational hypothesis a conscious and thought-through determination to kill John Frail, formed as the offender broke off from the fist fight and sustained over the duration necessary to get the weapon, catch up with the retreating victim and administer the blow.
	


Self defence rejected


	
	Some of the Crown witnesses said that as the offender closed upon John Frail on Federation Street the latter turned to face his attacker and moved towards him. Two witnesses said that John Frail put his hands and arms up in front of himself in a manner which I infer to have been defensive. The location of blood from the deceased on the roadway provided a possible basis for inferring that John Frail may have retraced his own course for some metres towards the scene of the fist fight and towards the offender before the offender reached him and used the knife.
	
	
	The offender relied upon this evidence, in the course of the trial, as a basis for asking the jury to find a reasonable possibility that he had perceived an attack upon himself by John Frail and had felt it necessary to defend himself by wounding with the knife. He relied upon self serving letters he had written whilst on remand in custody on this charge, which contained assertions that he had taken up the knife only to “scare” John Frail away. In final address defence counsel conceded that the fatal neck wound was a disproportionate response to the alleged occasion for self defence. See s 421 Crimes Act 1900. His case in this respect was for a verdict of manslaughter on the ground of excessive self defence rather than for outright acquittal.
	
	
	The jury clearly were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender did not, at any relevant time, consider it necessary to defend himself against John Frail by wielding the knife. John Frail was unarmed. There was no evidence that the offender thought or could reasonably have thought otherwise. It was far fetched to suggest that the offender, having deliberately armed himself and chased John Frail with a weapon in hand should suddenly have changed from being an attacker to one who apprehended danger from his unarmed, intoxicated victim. Given the way the case was left to the jury their finding on this point, beyond reasonable doubt, is perfectly clear. Independently I agree with it.
	


Intention to kill


	
	Lastly, the offender put in issue the question of whether he had held an intention either to kill John Frail or to cause him grievous bodily harm. The jury were directed that if they felt a reasonable doubt about the intention requisite for murder, in these alternatives, they would be required to return a verdict of not guilty on the murder count and a verdict of guilty of manslaughter in accordance with Wilson v R [1992] HCA 31; (1992) 174 CLR 313. The verdict returned shows that the jury found beyond reasonable doubt that the offender intended at least to cause grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	For the purposes of determining the degree of seriousness of the offence, being a matter of central importance in fixing the appropriate sentence, I must make a finding (if the evidence will permit) as between intention to kill and intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender’s intention was to kill John Frail. I have described the overhead plunging knife stroke which caused the fatal wound. The only other way such a wound could have been inflicted would have been if the victim’s upper body had been bent over from the waist to a near horizontal position and if the knife had then been used in a near horizontal plane, either thrusting forward or held for the deceased to charge onto it and impale himself.
	
	
	There was no evidence that John Frail ever assumed such a posture and therefore no basis upon which, as a reasonable possibility, the critical wound could have resulted from anything other than a knife stroke of the type that I have found. It is true that two witnesses described other knife strokes. Rebecca Trudgett described lunging or thrusting strokes, more or less horizontal. Kade MacKenzie described upward swinging strokes. These could have been what caused the wounds to the deceased’s right arm. Given the evidence of John Frail’s stance and movements these other strokes cannot have caused the deep neck wound. The overhead plunging stroke to the neck, as the first knife stroke of the encounter, cannot have been intended to have caused any harm short of death.
	
	
	The crime was one of a swift and spontaneous homicide. Without long premeditation but neither with any provocation, even of an order which could mitigate the objective seriousness of the killing. A young man’s life was taken on a violent impulse, pointlessly without reason.
	


Maximum penalty and standard non parole period


	
	The maximum penalty for murder is life imprisonment. This may be reduced to a specific term of years. By force of s 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) the reduction to a specific term may not be made if “the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through” a sentence of life imprisonment. In such a case a life sentence would be mandatory.
	
	
	I am not satisfied that this case satisfies the statutory test in s 61(1). I consider that I must fix an appropriate finite term of imprisonment. In doing so I will have regard to the standard non‑parole period of 20 years which applies to the offence of murder under Part 4 Div 1A, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	


Offender’s background


	
	Trent Towney is of Aboriginal descent and is now aged 23 years. According to evidence of his sister Karah given during the trial there was significant domestic violence throughout their upbringing. Their father was a shearer often absent from home. When he was with his family he frequently drank heavily and this would end with him physically abusing the mother of the offender and of Karah. There were two other younger siblings in the household and two more half siblings in the family. Domestic violence of this nature continued up until the sudden death of the offender’s mother in 2005 when Trent Towney was about 13 years old.
	
	
	I received evidence in statement form from the offender’s maternal grandfather, Mr Camkin. He and his wife were witness over many years to the dysfunction, violence and struggle of the offender’s early years. Mr Camkin has confirmed the physical and psychological abuse of their adopted daughter, the offender’s mother, by her husband. He also testified to the failure of Trent Towney’s father to bring home any money from his tours as a shearer and of the consequent deprivation of the family. Mr Camkin’s description of the sudden death of the offender’s mother and its impact upon the offender explains another setback in Trent Towney’s life.
	
	
	The family lived in the Wollongong area until 2005 and then moved to Dubbo. Trent Towney and his two younger full siblings remained living in Dubbo with the father for some years. Karah Towney soon returned to Wollongong. By July 2013 the offender’s father had become seriously ill. By the date of the events which ended in John Frail’s death, the offender was aware that his father’s illness was terminal. The father died in September 2013.
	
	
	The offender attended school until year 12 which must have been in 2010. But he did not complete that year. After leaving school he worked for three months in a café during 2010 but he has never had any other employment. He was supported on Centrelink benefits at the time of his arrest.
	
	
	The offender was in a relationship with Jade Hunt as at July 2013. She was then 18 years old. She was unstable and troubled, a product of a very unhappy, neglected and damaging early life. Jade Hunt was convicted and sentenced as an accessory after the fact of this murder for her part in having tried to destroy evidence of the offender’s commission of the crime. The remarks on sentence of Button J in R v Hunt [2014] NSWSC 1919 contain a more detailed account of Jade Hunt’s character and antecedents, to which I have had regard.
	


Offender’s substance abuse


	
	A presentence report on the offender was prepared by Miss Angela Croker dated 10 November 2015 in connection with sentence proceedings in the District Court at Dubbo before North DCJ. In those proceedings the offender was dealt with for two offences of aggravated breaking and entering committed in March 2013. The presentence report is sufficiently current for the purposes of the present sentencing exercise. It has been tendered and I have had regard to it.
	
	
	The offender told Miss Croker that he commenced daily consumption of alcohol at age nine years and cannabis use at age 13. By 15 he was using amphetamines and methylamphetamine or “ice”. Prior to July 2013 he had for a period used all three substances daily but he said that he had ceased all use of drugs and alcohol upon learning earlier in 2013 that Jade Hunt was pregnant. The offender had resolved to help support Jade and the expected child although he recognised that it was likely he was not the father. Jade Hunt’s baby was born 25 May 2013. Despite the offender’s intentions with respect to ceasing substance abuse, evidence given in the trial proved that he drank alcohol throughout the night of 19 and 20 July 2013. On the unchallenged evidence of Miss Trudgett he smoked either “a couple” or “a few” cones of cannabis that night as well.
	


Offender’s mental condition


	
	The offender told Miss Croker that he had attempted suicide at age 15 or 16 years which would have been in about 2007 or 2008 and again in 2013. There are no medical records to substantiate these dates. A report from the Wollongong Emergency Department dated 7 August 2011 records that on that day he made “an impulsive attempt at hanging while mildly intoxicated following argument with his girlfriend.” No evidence of psychosis was found by the psychiatric registrar who attended him at Wollongong nor did the registrar find any then current thoughts of self‑harm or of harm to others.
	
	
	The registrar said that engagement with psychological services and abstinence from intoxicating substances would be of most benefit to the offender. It is clear from subsequent history that this advice was not followed, at least not for any lasting period.
	
	
	On 18 December 2011 the offender presented at Shellharbour Emergency Department reporting voices in his head. Hospital staff were informed that he had had “a couple of episodes” that day “in the context of relapse of THC and alcohol abuse after around [six months] of significant reduced substance abuse.” Some depressive symptoms were noted.
	
	
	The significant feature of all this evidence with respect to mental health is that the offender has never been diagnosed with or treated for any clinically recognised psychiatric disorder or condition.
	


Allowance for background of disadvantage


	
	The decisions of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58 and of the High Court in Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; (2013) 249 CLR 571 are applicable to this case. In determining an appropriate sentence I must take into account the disadvantages to the offender, in his development, from having grown up in what appears to have been a chaotic and disordered family setting where domestic violence was frequent and severe, where alcohol abuse was an example set and where the following of that example by the offender from childhood went unchecked.
	
	
	From the same environment the offender’s sister Karah has grown into a mature, steady and impressive young woman. She gave her evidence in the trial under the most difficult circumstances imaginable with composure and dignity. But that does not refute that Trent Towney, with a different inherited makeup, has absorbed the adverse effects of the early family life that I have described and has suffered accordingly.
	
	
	I take these considerations into account, recognising at the same time other conflicting considerations which must be balanced. On the one hand there is a need to make allowance for the offender’s poor start in life and the weight to be given to general deterrence, for that reason. On the other hand there is a need to protect the community. This is discussed explicitly in Bugmy v The Queen at [44] to [46].
	


Criminal history of the offender


	
	The offender has relevant prior convictions for the following offences, committed on the dates indicated as follows:
	



	
	27 March 2011 aged 18 years:
	



	
	custody of an offensive implement in a public place;
	
	
	assault.
	



	
	27 November 2011 aged 19 years:
	



	
	assault occasioning actual bodily harm;
	
	
	stalk and intimidate.
	



	
	4 April 2012 aged 19 years:
	



	
	stalk and intimidate;
	
	
	contravene apprehended violence order.
	



	
	15 February 2013 aged 20 years:
	



	
	armed with intent to commit an indictable offence;
	
	
	destroy or damage property;
	
	
	assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
	



	
	3 March 2013 aged 20 years:
	



	
	enter building with intent to commit an indictable offence;
	
	
	destroy or damage property.
	



	
	19 March 2013 aged 20 years: aggravated break and enter and commit a serious indictable offence – two counts, comprising the breaking and entering of two separate commercial premises.
	



	
	The evident escalation in the offender’s criminal conduct from late 2011 over 16 months up to March 2013 resulted in increasingly stern sentences. Unfortunately he was able to go on to perpetrate all the offences of 2013, groups (4), (5) and (6) referred to above, whilst at liberty under supervised bonds for the offences of 4 April 2012, group (3). He was eventually called up on the bonds. Terms of imprisonment of three and four months were imposed but only after John Frail had been murdered. The offences of 19 March 2013 (being group (6), the two aggravated break and enters) were committed after he had been arrested and bailed for the offences of 15 February 2013, (group (4)).
	
	
	The murder for which the offender is now to be sentenced was committed whilst he was under supervised bonds for some offences and on bail for others. All of the offences in group (4) committed 15 February 2013, group (5) committed 3 March 2013 and group (6) committed 19 March 2013 have only been dealt with by the Court since his arrest for the murder of John Frail. They have attracted sentences of full‑time custody which he has served since his arrest for the murder.
	
	
	Those sentences expired on 1 May 2015. Commencement of his sentence on the present conviction for murder would be backdated initially to 2 May 2015. Then it must be backdated a further 129 days for the period he was on remand for the murder before he commenced to serve sentences for the other offences. That time served must count. Therefore the offender’s sentence for murder will be ordered to commence on 24 December 2014. This is an agreed date if there is to be no concurrence with the sentences for earlier offences, which he has served during his remand.
	
	
	There would be no justification for making the sentence I am now to impose for murder to any extent concurrent with the sentences served between 5 November 2013 and 1 May 2015 for the offences in groups (4) – (6) inclusive (see [46]). There is no commonality of facts in the underlying offences. The circumstance that Trent Towney was committing increasingly frequent and serious offences of other kinds up to the date he murdered John Frail provides no basis for diminishing the impact of the penalties for those discrete episodes by allowing any degree of concurrence with the sentence to be imposed for the murder.
	
	
	The offender’s criminal history shows a rapid descent into increasing criminality at a rate the justice system could not keep up with. Well intentioned efforts to keep him out of custody and to rehabilitate him with bonds under supervision and to allow bail pending the hearing of charges were abused. The orders allowed the offender the opportunity to commit increasingly serious crimes.
	


Prospects of rehabilitation


	
	The presentence report shows that Trent Towney’s disregard for the law and for authority continues and is, for the time being, apparently entrenched. He has had numerous misconduct charges laid against him whilst in custody, some quite serious concerning drugs and testing for drugs.
	
	
	Miss Croker considers the offender at a high risk of re‑offending. This conclusion was addressed to such risk with respect to offences like the break and enters for which he was before the District Court when her report was prepared. It is not a conclusion directly transferable to the conviction for murder in respect of which I am considering sentence. However the following part of Miss Croker’s report has application:
	


“The inmate has a history of illicit substance abuse which appears to have a direct impact on his violent/aggressive behaviours and ultimately his offending. Mr Towney appears to have no insight into his criminogenic factors and takes no responsibility or demonstrates no remorse for his actions.”


	
	I accept this assessment except that the last conclusion “takes no responsibility or demonstrates no remorse for his actions” is not applicable to the murder of John Frail. The offer of a plea of guilty to manslaughter inherently involved some acceptance of responsibility for John Frail’s death. He has repeated what I take to be a sincere recognition of that responsibility on oath in his evidence before me in the sentence proceedings. He fought the charge of murder on weak grounds and failed. He has thereby unsuccessfully denied the full measure of his intent and culpability. But I do not doubt that he feels remorse for having caused John Frail’s death.
	


Victim impact statements


	
	By s 28(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) it is provided that if the Court considers it appropriate to do so it may receive and consider a victim impact statement at any time after convicting and before sentencing an offender. I have considered it appropriate to receive “family victim” impact statements from both of the deceased’s parents and from five siblings either of full relationship or part, including a twin brother of the deceased. These statements have been received pursuant to subs (3) of s 28 which provides that a court, in a case where a primary victim has died, “must receive a victim impact statement given by a family victim and acknowledge its receipt, and may make any comment on it that the court considers appropriate”.
	
	
	The victim impact statements which I considered it appropriate to take into evidence were tendered in writing and most of them were read aloud to the Court by the deceased’s aunt, Deborah Frail. It is apparent from these statements that John Frail was a much loved young man. At the time of his death, he was cheerful, forward looking, hopeful of forming a lasting relationship with a young woman he had met, whom he thought was the one for him, and that he was determined to make himself a better man to meet her expectations.
	
	
	The devastation to all of these immediate family members who had shared life with John Frail was impressed upon me by the statements read. In accordance with the legislation I take this into account in connection with the determination of punishment for the offender, as an aspect of harm done to the community.
	


Aggravating and mitigating circumstances


	
	My remarks to this point have taken account of those aggravating circumstances within s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which are applicable: most importantly, paras (d), (ea) and (j). Paragraph (ea) is applicable because Brody Roach was present when John Frail was murdered and he was less than 18. His witnessing of this murder was a very significant and necessarily damaging experience in his life.
	
	
	I have not found that John Frail was vulnerable for the purposes of para (l) of s 21A(2) because the evidence does not permit me to conclude the degree to which his state of sobriety impeded any attempt he may have made to defend himself. It seems likely that he would have been rendered significantly helpless to ward off a knife attack with a blood alcohol reading of 0.227 but I do not have, from any eyewitness, any description of how he was handling that degree of intoxication. Nor can I draw a conclusion whether the offender perceived his victim to be vulnerable by reason of intoxication. The important feature of the knife attack is that it was swift, lethal from the first blow and made against a man known to the attacker to be unarmed.
	
	
	I do not treat paras (b), (c) or (g) of s 21A(2) as aggravating factors. These are the use of violence, the use of a weapon and substantial injury. They are inherent in the offence of murder as it was committed here.
	
	
	None of the mitigating factors listed in s 21A(3) is applicable. In particular, I cannot be confident of the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation (para (h)). In light of his criminal history, Ms Croker’s report and his poor record with respect to discipline in prison up to this date, the capacity of the offender to respond to attempts to rehabilitate him remains to be demonstrated. I accept the evidence he gave on oath in the sentence proceedings that he will pursue anger management and drug programs in prison and that he will seek education there. The limitation of this is that I cannot mitigate sentence in expectation of great, early progress on rehabilitation.
	
	
	With respect to para (c) of s 21A(3) I do not accept that the offender was provoked to inflict the fatal stab wound on John Frail by anything that the deceased did. I have referred to this to some extent already. In the conduct of John Frail, there was barely reason for the two to have had their fist fight. In common sense and reason, at worst their differences should have ended with John Frail’s departure across the street, as he had been requested, after they had exchanged blows. To that point there was no provocative conduct by John Frail which could sensibly be related to the murderous knife attack which followed.
	
	
	I reject the offender’s evidence, given before me in the sentence proceedings, that he believed John Frail had attempted to rape Jade Hunt earlier in the evening, before John Frail was excluded shortly after midnight. The offender would have known that there could not have been any such attempt in such a small house without him having seen it or become aware of it. And if he had had that thought, it is inconceivable that a man of his volatility and lack of inhibition would have failed to speak the allegation. He did not. No witness in the trial described any event which could have given the offender this idea nor reported any statement by him that suggested he had formed it.
	


Premeditation, post-offence conduct, intoxication


	
	I take into account that the attack was not long planned or premeditated. In forming a view about the appropriate penalty I have also had regard to the indifference shown in the offender’s post offence conduct. He was to some degree (it is uncertain how great) affected by alcohol when he committed the crime. The jury were clearly not satisfied that this gave rise to any reasonable doubt about his culpable state of mind and intent. Such self induced intoxication has limited relevance to sentencing for a crime of violence: ZZ v R [2013] NSWCCA 83 per Johnson J at [110] – [112]. There has been no attempt to show that the effect of alcohol caused the offender to act in a way that was out of character on this occasion.
	


Consistency with sentences passed in like cases


	
	In fixing a period of imprisonment for the offender’s crime I am bound to try to achieve consistency with sentences passed on other offenders for similar crimes, making due allowance in the comparison for points of difference in the objective seriousness of the offences under consideration on those other occasions and also allowing for differences in the offenders’ respective subjective circumstances, pleas and aggravating or mitigating circumstances. I am obliged to strive for consistency in this way by the High Court’s decisions in Wong v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 584 and Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 462.
	
	
	In Collon v R [2009] NSWCCA 187 a 21 year old offender who was the product of a dysfunctional, abusive upbringing and who had abused drugs from the age of 12 stabbed a 24 year old victim with whom he shared a home unit. The unit was made available to the two of them by a charity. Without it they would have been homeless.
	
	
	While the offender was intoxicated by alcohol and having sniffed butane he argued with the victim about allegedly stolen cigarettes. The argument progressed to a fist fight and then the offender inflicted numerous wounds with a carving knife, a smaller knife and a pair of scissors. A stab wound to the neck of the victim, and an incised wound across his neck and a penetrating wound into the pleural cavity from the back had been fatal. It was found that the offender had intended to kill the victim. The Crown accepted that the crime was the result of a loss of control. The offender was shocked by his own actions and he himself had called police and an ambulance to the scene.
	
	
	In addition to his dysfunctional background and substance abuse the offender suffered attention deficit hyperactive disorder and had a mild intellectual disability characterised by, amongst other things, impulsivity. A plea of guilty was entered shortly before the offender’s trial was to begin, for which a 15% discount was allowed.
	
	
	The Court of Criminal Appeal declined to interfere with a sentence comprised of a non-parole period of 14 years and 6 months and a balance of term of 6 years and 6 months. The offender had a prior criminal history involving violence. Without the discount, for comparison with the position of the offender before me whom I do not consider entitled to any utilitarian discount, the starting point sentence would have been 17 years non-parole period with a balance of term of 7 years and 7 months – an overall term of 24 years and 7 months.
	
	
	The offender’s loss of control in that case, his mild abnormality and his conduct immediately after the killing were all factors which tended to mitigate sentence in Collon but are not present in relation to Trent Towney. Also, the learned sentencing judge evidently found that special circumstances warranted increasing the proportion of the total sentence which could be served on parole pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I find no such special circumstances in this case.
	
	
	R v O’Donnell [2009] NSWSC 42 concerned a stabbing by a 21 year old offender at a dance venue. The victim, who was affected by alcohol, stepped on the foot of a young lady on the dance floor. The offender did not know the young lady but saw the incident. He demanded that the victim apologise, which was rejected aggressively. The offender approached the victim and stabbed him at least four times in a punching motion to the chest. One stab wound penetrated the heart and was fatal. The learned sentencing judge did not expressly find that there had been an intention to kill and I assume that his Honour fixed sentence on the basis that the intent was no higher than to inflict grievous bodily harm. The knife was of a fold out type which the offender had brought to the venue. He denied having stabbed the victim when first asked about it but then asserted that the deceased had “deserved it”.
	
	
	O’Donnell pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty of manslaughter and was convicted of murder. The learned sentencing Judge took account of the impact upon the offender of his parents’ marriage having been violent and having eventually dissolved. His mother had been institutionalised in a psychiatric facility when he was 6 years old. He had had no contact with his father in the 7 years up to the commission of the offence. O’Donnell had commenced drinking to excess at the age of 18 years and was smoking cannabis and using ice and other drugs up to the date of the offence.
	
	
	His Honour accepted a degree of remorse and good prospects of rehabilitation. It was considered that the offender’s psychiatric issues (mild paranoia) and the good prospects of rehabilitation, especially if psychiatric care should be addressed to the paranoia, warranted less weight being given to general deterrence. A non-parole period of 16 years and 6 months was imposed with a balance term of 5 years and 6 months, total 22 years. The absence of a finding of intention to kill and the favourable prospects of rehabilitation, coupled with the reduced need for general deterrence, were all factors which led to the sentence of O’Donnell being less than would be appropriate to Trent Towney. O’Donnell had no prior convictions.
	
	
	In R v Jones [2012] NSWSC 1433 the offender was 24 years old when he fatally stabbed a victim who had been knocked to the ground in a fight between them. A third man was involved on the offender’s side so that the murder was aggravated by it being committed in company. However, the learned sentencing judge accepted that there was no premeditation and that the offender had not brought the weapon to the party where the fight erupted. The fight had begun on a ground which was never established. Further his Honour allowed that the offender had only intended to inflict grievous bodily harm. The offender had a criminal history which disentitled him to lenience. He pleaded guilty during the course of a retrial and received no discount. His Honour accepted that the offender had shown genuine remorse by his change of plea and that he had some prospects of rehabilitation. He had had a dysfunctional family background. His father had left him when he was 5 years old, his mother had been addicted to heroin and his stepfather had died of a drug overdose when the offender was 17. A non-parole period of 14 years was imposed with a balance of term of 4 years and 8 months.
	
	
	Features of Trent Towney’s case which would cause a longer sentence than this to be imposed include theTrent Towney’s intent to kill, the absence of any change of plea to reflect recognition and acceptance of the full measure of his culpability and my finding that there are not demonstrated favourable prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	In R v Mbele [2013] NSWSC 1394 the offender was 22 years old when he stabbed to death a boy of 16 years 9 months. He was found guilty of murder following his trial. He was part of a gang which confronted another group in Bankstown late one afternoon. The offender had asserted to the opposing group that he “ran Bankstown”. He traded insults with the group and then engaged in a physical struggle with the victim, who gained the upper hand. The offender left the scene and later sought out the victim, armed with a dagger, with a premeditated intention of having a further confrontation. When he found the victim he sought to goad him into making the first attack.
	
	
	Eventually the victim thew a punch and the offender then stabbed him once, fatally, in the heart. The learned sentencing Judge found that the knife had been used with the intention of inflicting grievous bodily harm knowing that the victim was of imposing size and that the offender was at a disadvantage without a weapon. There was no remorse. The offender was on conditional liberty at the time of the offence. He had no relevant history of drug or alcohol misuse. The objective seriousness of the offence is closely comparable with that of Trent Towney’s offence. Mbele acted with greater premeditation than Trent Towney but not with intent to kill. Mbele’s background was not as severely disadvantaged as that of Trent Towney. The learned sentencing judge assessed that Mbele’s prospects of rehabilitation were reasonable. The sentence imposed was a non-parole period of 18 years with a balance of term of 8 years, a total of 26.
	
	
	In addition to those decisions I have considered and read carefully five others which were cited to me, each of which was in some degree comparable but each of which includes one or more features, either objective or subjective, which distinguishes it from the case before me in such a degree that I do not find it useful or necessary to recite the points of comparison or difference. These cases are Carr v R [2009] NSWSC 995, R v Shiels [2011] NSWSC 1177, Beldon v R [2012] NSWCCA 194, R v Shee [2012] NSWSC 1422, JBV v R [2012] NSWCCA 12.
	
	
	Two other cases, R v Barlow [2013] NSWSC 217 and R v Hines (No 3) [2014] NSWSC 1273, each involved combinations of objective and subjective factors fairly comparable with those of the case before me. I have considered those two cases in detail in forming my view about an appropriate sentence on the present facts, having due regard to the objective of achieving consistency.
	


Sentence


	
	Taking all of these considerations into account the sentence I impose is as follows.

2241554,R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 20) [2016] NSWSC 23,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: At various times on 21, 22, 26 and 28 October 2015 and 2 November 2015, I heard submissions from counsel with respect to a range of directions sought to be given to the jury as part of my summing up.
	
	
	I indicated rulings on the matters argued during the course of submissions on 22 October 2015 (T1664-1694), on 28 October 2015 (T1862-1863) and on 2 November 2015 (T2032).
	
	
	What follows constitutes my reasons for rulings made, where reasons have not already been given in the course of the trial.
	


Written Directions on Elements of Offences


	
	Draft written directions on the elements of the offences (MFI89) had been circulated to counsel and submissions were made as to their content.
	
	
	I made a number of rulings, leading to amendment or non-amendment to the draft directions with those rulings contained in the transcript (T1664-1693).
	
	
	A significant issue which I determined involved confirmation of the direction to be given to the jury concerning the meaning of the word “clitoris” in s.45(1) Crimes Act 1900. I confirmed what I had described as a provisional view in this respect at R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 2) [2015] NSWSC 1221 at [259]-[271]. I was fortified in this conclusion by the evidence of Professor Grover (T202) and Dr Marks (T1502, T1673), although, of course, the direction to be given involves a legal question concerning the proper construction of the term in its statutory context. The jury was directed that the word “clitoris” includes the clitoral head (prepuce).
	
	
	As foreshadowed to the parties, the final form of written directions on the elements of the offences (MFI113) was provided and explained to the jury on 28 October 2015 before closing addresses by counsel (T1871-1882). It was intended that the written directions would assist the jury during closing addresses. Amongst other things, the written directions sought to identify the real issues in dispute in the trial.
	


Complaint


	
	The Crown sought directions that evidence of complaint by C1 and C2 ought be admitted as evidence of the truth of the asserted facts under s.66 Evidence Act 1995 (MFI93 and MFI107). On 28 October 2015, I declined to give these directions (T1862).
	
	
	The evidence relied upon in this respect comprised:
	



	
	in the case of C1, matters contained in a discussion which took place between C1 and her father, A1, on the afternoon of 29 August 2012 concerning what she had told the investigating officials in the record of interview earlier that day about what the Crown alleged was female genital mutilation;
	
	
	in the case of C2, the matters referred to by C2 in her interview with investigating officials on 29 August 2012 (MFI8).
	



	
	Submissions were made concerning this issue, during which counsel for the Accused persons resisted the Crown application (T1720-1726).
	
	
	In my view, there was a fundamental difficulty with the Crown concerning this evidence. The evidence relied upon with respect to C1 is, in fact, her interview with investigating officials on 29 August 2012. This recorded interview forms part of her sworn evidence-in-chief before the jury by way of s.306V Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The audio-recorded conversation in the motor vehicle on the afternoon of 29 August 2012 was also in evidence before the jury (Exhibits AE, AF).
	
	
	The recorded interview with investigating officials was already in evidence as sworn evidence which was admissible for all purposes.
	
	
	The sworn evidence of C1 before the jury involved acknowledgment by her that she had discussed the matters contained in Exhibits AE and AF in the motor vehicle with her father. This discussion took place soon after C1 had revealed to investigating officials in her recorded interview, the fact that “khatna” had been performed upon her at a house in Wollongong in the presence of her mother. Again, I do not think that a s.66 direction was appropriate with respect to the conversation in the motor vehicle. To the extent that it constituted a complaint, the fact that it was said was not in doubt given the contemporaneous recording made of the conversation. Further, it was said soon after what was said in the record of interview. It may be said that the conversation in the motor vehicle involved additional matters, including reference to “scissors”.
	
	
	I was not persuaded that any direction utilising s.66 Evidence Act 1995 ought be made with respect to C1.
	
	
	With respect to C2, the complaint referred to by the Crown was confined to a short part of the recorded interview (pages 18-19, MFI8). At this point, investigators asked C2 if she had “talked to anybody else” (about the alleged female genital mutilation event) and she responded that she had spoken to “my dad” who had said “It’s OK” (Q/A247-249, page 19, MFI8).
	
	
	The recorded interview of C2 forms part of her sworn evidence before the jury by application of s.306V Criminal Procedure Act 1986. There is no more detailed description of what C2 is said to have revealed to her father. In these circumstances, I did not consider that a s.66 direction was appropriate. In the case of C2, the conversation was confined to the record of interview with investigating officials, which was already in evidence. Further, a short and cryptic response was given by C2 which did not reveal any particular acts about which complaint is said to have been made to her father.
	
	
	It was for these reasons that I declined the Crown application to give any direction concerning the further use of this evidence by way of s.66 Evidence Act 1995.
	


Murray Direction


	
	Mr Bouveng sought a Murray direction (MFI91). On 28 October 2015, I declined to give such a direction (T1862).
	
	
	Mr Bouveng submitted that this was a case where C1 and C2 were each essential witnesses to the Crown case so that a warning ought be given in accordance with R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that a Murray direction should not be given in this case. It was argued that this case involves a combination of direct and circumstantial evidence, with witnesses supporting the Crown case beyond C1 and C2.
	
	
	In Ewen v R [2015] NSWCCA 117, Simpson J (as her Honour then was) observed, at [104], that a Murray direction is most commonly used in a case in which the sole evidence of the commission of a crime is that of a single witness, with the direction inviting the jury to scrutinise the evidence of that witness with great care.
	
	
	I accepted the Crown submission that this is not a case where the evidence of C1 and C2 represents the sole evidence of the commission of an offence. There was a combination of evidence, both direct and circumstantial, upon which the Crown relies, including the telephone intercept and surveillance device evidence.
	
	
	In these circumstances, I declined to give a Murray direction.
	


Circumstantial Evidence Direction


	
	Both Mr Sutherland SC and Mr Bouveng submitted that this case was based upon circumstantial evidence, so that the Court should give a circumstantial evidence direction.
	
	
	Mr Sutherland SC submitted that, in truth, this was a case based solely on circumstantial evidence so that a direction should be given upon that basis which directed the jury to acquit if there was a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence on each count.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that this was a case involving direct and circumstantial evidence, so that directions should not be given upon the basis that the Crown case was wholly circumstantial.
	
	
	In my view, the Crown case involved a combination of direct evidence and circumstantial evidence. Although some of the direct evidence involved the need to draw relevant inferences, so that the Crown case may be seen as being based partly on circumstantial evidence, this case should not be characterised as one based entirely on circumstantial evidence.
	
	
	The jury ought be directed with respect to the use of both direct and circumstantial evidence, including the drawing of inferences. However, it was not appropriate in this case to direct the jury as though the case was a purely circumstantial evidence one.
	
	
	I gave a ruling to this effect on 28 October 2015 (T1862).
	


Direction under s.165A(2) Evidence Act 1995


	
	Mr Bouveng sought a direction under s.165A(2) Evidence Act 1995 with respect to the evidence of C2 (MFI91). On 28 October 2015, I declined to give such a direction (T1862).
	
	
	In support of this application, counsel contended that there were factors apart from C2’s age, six years at the time of the interview on 29 August 2012, and nine years at the time of giving evidence in September 2015.
	
	
	Reference was made to part of Exhibit AX, which contains certain details about C2. Exhibit AX states that C2 had been diagnosed with a mild intellectual disability and had difficulties concentrating and had limited attention, but had the capacity to answer questions and give evidence if motivated. Exhibit AX stated, as well, that C2 was currently enrolled in Year 4 at a public school, and that she was in an age-appropriate year at school and was functioning in a normal school environment with additional learning assistance.
	
	
	Mr Bouveng sought, as part of the proposed s.165A(2) direction (MFI91), that the jury be reminded that C2 “has been diagnosed with a mild intellectual disability and has problems with concentration”. I observe that, if any s.165A(2) direction was to be given, it would have been appropriate to refer to the entirety of the matters contained in Exhibit AX.
	
	
	Mr Bouveng submitted, as well, that the Court should inform the jury, in the proposed s.165A(2) direction, that some of the questions asked of C2 by investigating officials in the interview of 29 August 2012 involved the use of leading questions. I gave a ruling, for the purpose of s.37 Evidence Act 1995, concerning the suggested use of leading questions during the interview of C2 (PT732): R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 21) [2016] NSWSC 24 at [3].
	
	
	Mr Bouveng sought, as well, as part of the proposed direction, a statement by the Court that there was no opportunity for the Accused KM to properly examine C2 about her assertions. In this respect, I note the discussion which took place, in the absence of the jury, at a point where Mr Bouveng had asked C2 a number of questions in cross-examination (T179-183). Mr Bouveng had indicated that, in his view, there was no real point in proceeding further with cross-examination in light of answers given by C2. Both the Crown Prosecutor and I stated that, if he took that course, there would be no criticism made of him upon the basis that he had not put his instructions to C2.
	
	
	I keep in mind the ruling made under s.42 Evidence Act 1995 which restricted the use of leading questions, in the first instance, in cross-examination of C1, with leave being left open to Mr Bouveng to ask leading questions in cross-examination after he had utilised, in the first instance, non-leading questions (T111-113). Mr Bouveng cross-examined C1 (T136-143), but did not feel the need to make an application to use leading questions with that witness.
	
	
	I made a similar ruling with respect to C2, namely that a two-stage approach should be adopted where non-leading questions were used, in the first instance, with leave for counsel to seek to ask leading questions in the light of answers given to non-leading questions (T168-169). The cross-examination of C2 by Mr Bouveng was short (T177-178). Following those questions, there was the indication, to which I have already referred, that there would be no criticism of him for not seeking to ask further questions.
	
	
	My reasons for the rulings made under ss.37 and 42 Evidence Act 1995 concerning C1 and C2 are contained in R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 21).
	
	
	It would not have been appropriate, in these circumstances, to give a direction to the jury which included the proposition that there was no opportunity for the Accused KM to properly cross-examine C2 about her assertions. The position expressed by the Crown Prosecutor and myself was that there would be no criticism or other adverse comment (along the lines that there had been non-compliance with the rule in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67)).
	
	
	The Crown opposed the giving of a s.165A(2) direction concerning C2. It was submitted that a foundation for such a direction had not been established in this case.
	
	
	Sections 165 and 165A Evidence Act 1995 are in the following terms:
	


“165    Unreliable evidence

(1)    This section applies to evidence of a kind that may be unreliable, including the following kinds of evidence:

(a)    evidence in relation to which Part 3.2 (hearsay evidence) or 3.4 (admissions) applies,

(b)    identification evidence,

(c)    evidence the reliability of which may be affected by age, ill health (whether physical or mental), injury or the like,

(d)    evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness, being a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding,

(e)    evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness who is a prison informer,

(f)    oral evidence of questioning by an investigating official of a defendant that is questioning recorded in writing that has not been signed, or otherwise acknowledged in writing, by the defendant,

(g)    in a proceeding against the estate of a deceased person - evidence adduced by or on behalf of a person seeking relief in the proceeding that is evidence about a matter about which the deceased person could have given evidence if he or she were alive.

(2)    If there is a jury and a party so requests, the judge is to:

(a)    warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable, and

(b)    inform the jury of matters that may cause it to be unreliable, and

(c)    warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it.

(3)    The judge need not comply with subsection (2) if there are good reasons for not doing so.

(4)    It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in giving the warning or information.

(5)    This section does not affect any other power of the judge to give a warning to, or to inform, the jury.

(6)    Subsection (2) does not permit a judge to warn or inform a jury in proceedings before it in which a child gives evidence that the reliability of the child’s evidence may be affected by the age of the child. Any such warning or information may be given only in accordance with section 165A (2) and (3).

Note. The Commonwealth Act does not include subsection (6).

165A    Warnings in relation to children’s evidence

(1)    A judge in any proceeding in which evidence is given by a child before a jury must not do any of the following:

(a)    warn the jury, or suggest to the jury, that children as a class are unreliable witnesses,

(b)    warn the jury, or suggest to the jury, that the evidence of children as a class is inherently less credible or reliable, or requires more careful scrutiny, than the evidence of adults,

(c)    give a warning, or suggestion to the jury, about the unreliability of the particular child’s evidence solely on account of the age of the child,

(d)    in the case of a criminal proceeding - give a general warning to the jury of the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of a witness who is a child.

(2)    Subsection (1) does not prevent the judge, at the request of a party, from:

(a)    informing the jury that the evidence of the particular child may be unreliable and the reasons why it may be unreliable, and

(b)    warning or informing the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence of the particular child and the weight to be given to it,

if the party has satisfied the court that there are circumstances (other than solely the age of the child) particular to the child that affect the reliability of the child’s evidence and that warrant the giving of a warning or the information.

(3)    This section does not affect any other power of a judge to give a warning to, or to inform, the jury.”


	
	It should be noted that s.165(6) makes clear that a s.165(2) warning should not be given concerning the reliability of a child’s evidence, with such a warning to be given only in accordance with s.165A(2) and (3).
	
	
	Section 165A(1) prohibits a trial Judge from giving a warning in relation to the evidence of a child. Section 165A(2) permits the Court to give a warning if such a direction is requested, and if the Court is satisfied that such a direction is appropriate in the circumstances of the case.
	
	
	I keep in mind what has been said frequently with respect to the use of s.165 Evidence Act 1995, namely that it does not deal with unreliability of witnesses generally. Rather, the need for a warning typically arises either because the jury needs to be acquainted with the accumulated experience of courts dealing with certain types of evidence, or because there is the danger that the jury may overestimate the probative value of certain evidence: R v Baartman [2000] NSWCCA 298 at [62]; R v Stewart [2001] NSWCCA 260; 52 NSWLR 301 at 308 [38], 321-323 [95]-[101]; GAR v R (No. 2) [2010] NSWCCA 164 at [97]. In my view, these principles have some application, as well, where a warning under s.165A is sought with respect to a child witness in a trial.
	
	
	It is to be kept in mind, as well, that the issue to be considered, where application is made under s.165A, is whether the Court should give a warning under the provision. It is not the purpose of the section to require a trial Judge to give judicial support and sanction to defence submissions concerning a child witness, unless a clear foundation has been given for the use of s.165A in the particular case.
	
	
	As Fullerton J stated in RGM v R [2012] NSWCCA 89 at [97] (with the agreement of McClellan CJ at CL and myself):
	


“A trial judge has a wide discretion to offer guidance to a jury as to how to approach the evidence of a child witness which should be tailored to meet the particular circumstances of the case and the issues that the jury are likely to encounter in their deliberations. Save only where a trial judge is satisfied that the evidence of a particular child may be unreliable in a particular respect, and that there is a need for the jury to exercise caution in assessing the evidence thereby invoking the exception in s 165A(2) of the Evidence Act, it is important that a trial judge refrain from suggesting an approach to the assessment of a child's evidence in such a way that it has the appearance of a direction of law.”


	
	The account given by C2 in her record of interview with investigating officials on 29 August 2012 was not challenged substantially in the account given by the Accused KM in her own evidence before the jury. One of the questioners used the word “cut” in a question directed to C2, to which the young girl gave an affirmative response. Later on, C2 said that she had been “hurt” in her bottom during this event. KM maintained in her evidence that she had not cut C2.
	
	
	If there was to be any warning to be given to the jury in this case, it would be confined to a reminder of the age of C2 at relevant times, combined with the contents of Exhibit AX. Reference might be made, as well, to the relatively limited answers given by her in response to questions asked in the presence of the jury.
	
	
	However, the jury was well aware of all these matters.
	
	
	In my view, a foundation had not been established for a s.165A(2) warning with respect to C2 in this case. It was not demonstrated that there was a requirement, on top of any submissions that counsel may make, for the Court to give its own independent warning concerning features bearing upon C2.
	


Good Character


	
	Mr Bouveng sought a direction concerning the use of evidence of good character with respect to his client, KM, who has given evidence in the trial. He submitted that the usual direction should be given inviting the jury to have regard to evidence of good character for two purposes, namely the likelihood of a person of good character committing the offence and also with respect to the credibility of KM as a witness in the trial.
	
	
	Mr Sutherland SC sought a good character direction with respect to his clients for the first purpose, in view of the fact that neither gave evidence in the trial.
	
	
	On 28 October 2015, I noted that I would give directions on good character (T1862).
	


Post-Offence Conduct and Consciousness of Guilt (Lies)


	
	Ultimately, the Crown sought directions to the jury concerning post-offence conduct or consciousness of guilt by reference to lies which were said to have been told by A2 and KM (MFIs 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 117; T2182-2186).
	
	
	The Crown pointed to instances where the Accused A2 gave a false story, by way of the “Africa checking” story, to police during records of interview. The Crown pointed, as well, to what were said to have been lies, and the development of the false “Africa checking” story, in telephone intercepts and in conversations recorded by means of surveillance devices.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that lies had been told, as well, by the Accused KM which should attract a consciousness of guilt direction.
	
	
	In an earlier judgment, I noted that it would be necessary to formulate directions to be given to the jury concerning lies and consciousness of guilt: R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 7) [2015] NSWSC 1427 at [24].
	
	
	A clear foundation was laid for the giving of an orthodox consciousness of guilt/post-offence conduct direction to the jury in accordance with established authority with respect to the Accused A2 and the Accused KM.
	
	
	The Crown accepted a direction concerning consciousness of guilt or post-offence conduct ought not be given concerning the Accused Vaziri (T2184-2186). All alleged lies said to have been told by the Accused Vaziri took place in the offence period 12 August 2012 to 9 October 2012. These alleged lies were relied upon by the Crown as direct evidence of the offences charged against him. As the written directions on the elements of the offences (MFI113) recited at paragraphs 72, 81, 87 and 94:
	


“It is the Crown case that the Accused Vaziri assisted [A2] and [KM] by encouraging them, potential witnesses and other members of the Dawoodi Bohra community to lie to police or to not disclose relevant information to police. Additionally it is the Crown case that the Accused Vaziri was himself involved in putting forward false information to police”.


	
	Directions concerning post-offence conduct or consciousness of guilt were given to the jury with respect to A2 and KM.

		08 February 2016",2016-02-04 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2241564,Carratt v R [2016] NSWDC 7,"Judgment


	
	Mitchell Carratt has appealed from sentences imposed on him by his Honour Magistrate Connell sitting in the Local Court. The magistrate sent Mitchell Carratt to gaol. The magistrate really had no choice because Mitchell Carratt had run out of opportunities which the court system had provided to him. He committed offences of shoplifting, destroying and damaging property, larceny and contravening an apprehended domestic violence order as well as a further offence of shoplifting.
	
	
	The Local Court had given him good behaviour bonds and suspended sentences, but he kept breaching them. He has been in custody since 23 September last year and when he came before Magistrate Connell he received prison sentences for all of these offences. The magistrate sentenced him to six months for the shoplifting and six months for the damage to the property and nine months for two larceny offences. They were concurrent with a non-parole period of six months.
	


BERESFORD: Sorry, your Honour, one them was a section 9.


	
	For one of the larcenies he received a sentence of nine months with a non-parole period of twelve months. For the other he received a bond under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) of 30 months. For contravening the apprehended domestic violence order the magistrate sentenced Mitchell Carratt to twelve months imprisonment and set a non-parole period of eight months. For the final shoplifting committed on 23 September 2015 when he was arrested and went into custody he received a prison sentence of twelve months with a non-parole period of eight months.
	
	
	The overall effective sentence is one of one year and eight months (that is, 20 months) imprisonment. His sentences apparently date from 31 January 2015. The non-parole period of fifteen months and 22 days does not accord with the envisaged non-parole period of 75 percent contained in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. It does not have to accord with that, but it is unusual for a non-parole period to exceed 75 percent. Indeed, Parliament envisages that a non-parole period can be reduced below 75 percent if there are special circumstances for doing so.
	
	
	In this case Ms K Beresford, who appears for Mr Carratt in the sentence appeal, has argued that I should reduce the non-parole period to 22 March 2016 from the present release date of 22 May 2016. She says the special circumstances for doing that are these. Her client is 26. It is his first time in prison. In fact he told me when I asked him that it has had a significant impact upon him. He has been assaulted a number of times and has formed a very clear view that he does not want to return to prison. He needs time to return to his treating psychologist and to re-engage in that treatment.
	
	
	Mitchell Carratt lives at home with his father and his grandmother. His father, who is a labourer, may be able to secure work for him and he is wanting to undertake a rigger's course at TAFE which starts in April this year. He has had drug problems and behavioural problems in the past. These obviously have resulted in him ending up in prison. These problems are reflected in his criminal record, which extends over a relatively short period of time. He committed only one offence when he was under 18.
	
	
	I think Ms Beresford has made out a case for reducing the non-parole period. Ms R Buttini, who appears for the respondent to the appeal, the Director of Public Prosecutions, acknowledges the case made.
	
	
	I propose to allow the appeal and to reduce the non-parole period for those reasons put forward by Ms Beresford.
	
	
	The formal order which I make is this. Under s 20(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) I determine these appeals against sentence as follows. In respect of the larceny (sequence 1), I vary the sentence by reducing the non-parole period from six months and 23 days to six months to expire on 22 March 2016. In respect of the contravene apprehended domestic violence order, I reduce the non-parole period from eight months to six months to expire on 22 March 2016. In respect of the second shoplifting offence, I reduce the non-parole period from eight months to six months to expire on 22 March 2016.
	
	
	In respect of each of those varied sentences, I make an order directing that Mr Carratt be released on parole on 22 March 2016. The conditions of his parole are these -
	



	
	That he be of good behaviour.
	
	
	That he accept supervision from the NSW Community Corrections Service and for that purpose reports to the Community Corrections office at Sutherland on or before 29 March 2016.
	
	
	That he live with his grandmother and father at [address].
	
	
	That he attend his general practitioner and comply with any medication prescribed by that general practitioner.
	
	
	That he re-engage with his treating psychologist.

		12 February 2016",2016-02-07 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2241605,Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Frank [2016] NSWLC 2,"Judgment


	
	The defendant has pleaded guilty to one count of dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage for another by deception, contrary to s 192E(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900. The matter came before me in the DPP list at the Downing Centre on 21 January 2016 at which time Mr Charleston appeared for the Director and Mr Madden for the defendant. I heard submissions from both parties on that day and then adjourned the matter until today for decision.
	
	
	The facts of the offending in this case required me to give some thought to a number of issues that were raised and it was for this reason that the matter was adjourned last week.
	
	
	The facts are that the defendant is a police officer. He holds the rank of Constable. He is aged 36 years and was 34 at the time of the offence which took place on 6 August 2014. He joined the Police Force in 2011 and had been a sworn officer for just under 3 years when he offended in the way that he did. For many years prior to his actually doing so, he had wished to join the New South Wales Police Force. It seems that he had held this ambition since he was a young person.
	
	
	The Agreed Facts tendered note that at August 2014 the defendant was attached to the Miranda Local Area Command. Relevantly, prior to joining the police he had held a number of different jobs, including as a qualified motor mechanic. The co-offender Jason Clarke was his superior and a Sergeant at the Miranda Police Station. Sergeant Clarke’s son Lachlan had at some time prior to 6 August 2014 been involved in a motor vehicle accident. The facts reveal that Sergeant Clarke spoke to the defendant in his office at the Miranda Police Station on or about 5 August 2014. During that meeting Sergeant Clarke told him about his son’s motor vehicle accident. He told him that the accident was not his son’s fault and that it was as a result of a mechanical defect. He further told him that he had previously had problems with the vehicle and that there was definitely a mechanical fault with it. He indicated that another officer from Miranda was investigating the accident and requested that he (the defendant) as an ex-motor mechanic, prepare a statement to the effect that he had inspected his son’s vehicle and that the accident which had occurred was in fact as a result of mechanical fault. The defendant queried Sergeant Clarke as to whether there was a conflict of interest in him preparing such a report and he was assured by Sergeant Clarke that there was not. Both the defendant and Sergeant Clarke plainly would have understood that if the report were accepted, then Sergeant Clarke’s son Lachlan would avoid the issue of a Traffic Infringement Notice and no doubt, the accrual of demerit points.
	
	
	Without inspecting the vehicle but after viewing a photograph of it, which was provided to him by Sergeant Clarke, the defendant then prepared a mechanical report indicating that he had inspected the vehicle and that the subject accident was caused by a mechanical defect in the vehicle’s near side CV shaft assembly. The assertion that he inspected the vehicle was false. The statement was prepared while the defendant was at work and shortly thereafter was placed in Sergeant Clarke’s pigeon hole at Miranda Police Station. Sergeant Clarke then provided this false report to the investigating police officer and as a consequence no Traffic Infringement Notice was issued to his son.
	
	
	The benefit obtained by Sergeant Clarke’s son as a result of the defendant’s deception was in the amount of $425, that being the amount of the Traffic Infringement Notice that would otherwise have been issued.
	
	
	In considering this matter I have had cause to remind myself of the principle in The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383. I must deal only with the offence before the Court and I cannot take into account any circumstance of aggravation that would justify the laying of a more serious charge. There would appear to be other more serious offences with which the defendant could have been charged. The DPP has however elected to bring this particular charge before the Court and so it is this charge that I must deal with. With that in mind I note that the financial advantage gained for another is modest ($425) and that no financial advantage of any sort was obtained at all by the defendant. These matters were conceded by Mr Charleston in his submissions to me.
	
	
	I accept that the defendant, in conducting himself as he did, felt overborne by his superior officer. So much is clear from his record of interview with investigating police from the Professional Standards Command on 22 January 2015. It should also be noted that as soon as he became aware of the investigation the defendant prepared a written confession and presented it to those investigating officers at the time of his interview. I have carefully read both the interview and the defendant’s statement and I accept that they demonstrate real remorse, contrition and shame on his part. I also accept that the defendant had nothing to gain from his deception other than for avoiding the risk of getting on the wrong side of his superior officer who, no doubt, had the ability because of his position to make life difficult for the defendant, a relatively junior constable working in the same police station. The police force is like many social institutions, hierarchical and almost military in nature. It relies on junior officers following the directions of those more senior for it to function effectively and in the public interest. Given that rigid command structure, I accept that when a senior officer behaves in the way that the Agreed Facts show Sergeant Clarke behaved, then a junior, relatively inexperienced and somewhat powerless officer such as the defendant would have felt under considerable pressure to comply with the directions he had been given. This is even if he was of the view, as he seemingly was, that what he was engaging in was inappropriate. While the offence occurred during working hours, the defendant did not otherwise abuse his position as a police officer in committing the offence. This offence does not rely on the defendant being a police officer (although this is how he came to be acquainted with Sergeant Clarke), rather it relies on his being a weak willed and overborne former motor mechanic.
	
	
	An important aspect of this matter concerns the assistance to authorities that has been provided by the defendant. He has already provided assistance regarding the prosecution of Sergeant Clarke and has signed an undertaking to do so in the future. Sergeant Clarke, so far as I can tell, has been charged with misconduct in public office or some like public justice offence. Such a charge is most serious and the defendant’s assistance will plainly be crucial to the prosecution of Sergeant Clarke. There is of course a significant public interest in those who abuse public positions of authority being prosecuted to the full extent allowed by the law, and no doubt the defendant will play a significant role in that prosecution.
	
	
	It has long been the case that a sentencing court is able to extend leniency to an offender who has provided assistance to authorities. Sometimes, that leniency will be substantial, especially if it is motivated by genuine remorse and contrition. I accept that it is in this case. In extending leniency for assistance courts must ensure that the ultimate outcome is not disproportionate to the actual offending. As in any sentencing task, the court must strive to impose a penalty that is, in the final analysis, a fair and just one. The discount for assistance can result in the imposition of a less serious sentencing option and is not limited to the imposition of a numerically lesser penalty.
	
	
	Section 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 indicates how a court is to deal with the issue of assistance to authorities. Subsection (2) sets out the matters a court must consider in determining whether a lesser penalty is to be imposed. Dealing with those considerations in turn, I note:
	


(b)      The significance and usefulness of the defendant’s assistance is high.

(c)      The truthfulness, completeness and reliability of the information provided by the defendant is apparently regarded by the Director of Public Prosecutions as high (s 23(2)(b)).

(d)      The nature and extent of the assistance and promised assistance is high.

(e)      The assistance was offered in a timely fashion.

(f)      The benefit to be gained by the defendant appears solely to relate to the disposition of this sentence.

(g)      Not relevant

(h)      The defendant has not suffered so far as I am aware, any danger or risk of injury to date. That is not to say that he may not in the future suffer a risk of injury to his reputation and otherwise from the fact that he has now, to use the vernacular, “ratted” on a fellow officer. 

(i)       While it is the court’s most fervent hope that such retribution would not be exacted, I cannot discount completely the possibility that some misguided police would take a dim view of the brave stand that has now been taken by the defendant, and so cause his ongoing employment (if he is to have it and I note there is no guarantee in that regard) to be less comfortable and productive than it should be.

(j)      The assistance provided concerns the offence for which the defendant is being sentenced.


	
	As will be plain, many of the section 23 factors that must be considered operate favourably for the defendant, and in my assessment he must be given very significant leniency in the disposition of this matter. It is necessary for me to indicate the penalty that would have been imposed but for the defendant’s  assistance and I will shortly return to this.
	
	
	Mr Madden has submitted that I should deal with the matter pursuant to section 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and that no conviction ought be recorded. While not conceding that the matter should be disposed of in this way, the DPP did not seek to be otherwise heard in respect of that submission. In considering this submission I must have regard to the aggravating and mitigating factors set out in section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I accept that there are no relevant aggravating factors within the meaning of the section. There are, however, a substantial number of mitigating factors to which I must have regard. They are:
	



	
	the injury, emotional harm, loss, or damage caused by the defendant was not substantial,
	
	
	the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity,
	
	
	the offender was acting under duress,
	
	
	the offender does not have any record (or any significant record) of previous convictions,
	
	
	the offender was a person of good character,
	
	
	the offender is unlikely to re-offend,
	
	
	the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation whether by reason of the offenders age or otherwise,
	
	
	the remorse shown by the offender for the offence,
	
	
	a plea of guilty by the offender (as provided by section 22),
	
	
	assistance by the offender to law enforcement authorities (as provided by section 23).
	



	
	Mr Madden, in his comprehensive and helpful written submissions drew my attention to a number of authorities dealing with section 10, and those have been  considered by me. It is contended that one consequence of a conviction upon this defendant would be that his continuing employment with the police force would be less likely than if he were not convicted. Of course that at the end of the day will be a matter for the Commissioner of Police but on balance I am satisfied that a conviction may make the defendant’s dismissal more likely. As was made clear in R v Mauger [2012] NSWCCA 51 per Harrison J (with whom Beazley JA, as the President then was, and McCallum J agreed) at [28], the prospect of the conviction having a detrimental consequence upon employment is something that I am entitled to and do take into account. That decision also makes clear that the imposition of a bond, even without conviction can meet the need for denunciation and general deterrence in an appropriate case and that it is wrong “to assume that the decision to not record a conviction is automatically or necessarily co-extensive with the imposition of an inadequate, or even a particularly lenient, sentence” (at [37]).
	
	
	It is submitted and I accept that in this case a combination of the following features allow me to conclude that it is one which can be disposed of without recording a conviction. These features are:
	



	
	The defendant’s immediate admissions to investigators,
	
	
	His early plea of guilty,
	
	
	The significant assistance that he has provided to date and will provide in the future,
	
	
	His genuine remorse,
	
	
	The fact that he is a person of otherwise good character,
	
	
	The fact that he is unlikely to reoffend and has good prospects of rehabilitation,
	
	
	The fact that the benefit received was modest,
	
	
	The fact that he received no financial benefit whatsoever,
	
	
	The fact that not recording a conviction will assist his prospects of retaining his employment,
	
	
	The extenuating and unusual circumstances of the offence in the context of the hierarchical structure of the police force.
	



	
	I have concluded that this disposition will not affront community standards or be otherwise inappropriate and the matter can be disposed of in this way notwithstanding that the offence is not itself a trivial one. I propose to order that the dismissal of the charge be conditional upon the defendant entering a bond to be of good behaviour. Such a bond will satisfy the need for denunciation and general  deterrence. In my view specific deterrence has no role to play in this case. To comply with the provision of section 23(4)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act I state that without the significant assistance that has been and is to be provided by the defendant a more serious penalty would have been imposed, being a conviction and the imposition of a section 9 bond.
	


Orders:


	
	I find the offence proved but deem it inexpedient to inflict any punishment. The charge will be dismissed pursuant to the provisions of section 10(1)(b) of the Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act conditional on the defendant entering into a bond to be of good behaviour for a period of 18 months.

2241743,R v Biljuh (No 7) [2015] NSWSC 1917,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	On 26 May 2015, Dario Biljuh (the offender) was arraigned on an indictment before a jury panel and me at Darlinghurst courthouse. The indictment contained a single count, averring that on 14 February 2014 at Villawood he murdered his mother, Laura Biljuh (the deceased). A jury was empanelled on that day, and the trial proceeded for some weeks.
	
	
	Towards the end of the trial, I rejected an application by defence counsel that manslaughter should be left to the jury. On 22 June 2015, after a short retirement, the jury returned a unanimous verdict of guilty of murder.
	
	
	After that, the proceedings on sentence were adjourned more than once so that a report from a forensic psychiatrist, who had also treated the offender for many months some years ago, could be placed before me. The proceedings on sentence eventually concluded on 4 December 2015, and the offender will be sentenced today.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offence of murder is imprisonment for life without parole. The Crown prosecutor made no submission in support of the imposition of that ultimate sentence. There is also an applicable standard non-parole period, in the circumstances of this case, of 20 years. I regard both the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period as important guideposts in my exercise of the sentencing discretion.
	
	
	It is my task to find the facts of the matter consistent with the elements of the offence that the jury found, by its verdict, to have been proven beyond reasonable doubt. Matters of aggravation on sentence that operate against the offender must be proven to the same very high standard; matters of mitigation that operate in his favour need only be proven on the balance of probabilities.
	
	
	I should say at this stage that, due to the fact that the offender has told very many lies (some of them admitted) about the circumstances of the death of his mother, I regard his credibility with regard to any disputed matter as being negligible or non-existent.
	


Objective features


	
	I turn to discuss the circumstances of the offence.
	
	
	As at 14 February 2014, the deceased was living in the family home in the Sydney suburb of Villawood. Although she lived alone in those premises, her son Nenad Biljuh was living in a “granny flat” at the back of the property, due to a number of recent business failures on his part. The daughter of the deceased and sister of the offender, Ms Gabriella Biljuh, resided in Melbourne. The offender, for reasons that I shall explain later, was sleeping on a couch at a friend’s home in the Sydney suburb of Burwood Heights.
	
	
	The deceased was then aged 70 years. She was known to her neighbours, and was in the habit of going for a daily walk with friends. She had contact with her son Nenad, of course, and also with her daughter in Melbourne.
	
	
	On the evening of 13 February 2014, the offender set his alarm to go off at 4:30 AM the following day. He also had in his possession a “Fitness First” backpack that contained a number of items, including a torch, cable ties, and duct tape.
	
	
	I reject the evidence of the offender that he set his alarm at that early hour because he wished to take some morning exercise at the Bay Run in the inner west suburb of Five Dock. Rather, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he set his alarm at that time because he had decided to travel, under cover of darkness, to the home of his mother; await the departure of his brother for work later in the morning; enter her home; and murder her.
	
	
	I also reject the evidence of the offender that the contents of the backpack were nothing more than innocent bits and pieces left over from a recent move from one residence to another that had not yet been unpacked. Rather, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, at the latest by the time he went to bed on the evening of 13 February 2014, the offender had packed that backpack with those items so that he could commit the offence. To adopt respectfully the phrase used by the Crown prosecutor in his final address to the jury, the backpack was a “toolkit for murder”.
	
	
	The offender rose at 4:30 AM or thereabouts and travelled to the home of his mother with the backpack in his possession. He waited until his brother left for work at 5:40 AM. Thereafter, some time between then and a little before 7:00 AM that day, the offender entered the home of the deceased without her consent or (to my mind, a less likely possibility) inveigled his way in.
	
	
	Once inside his mother’s home, he manually strangled her, breaking a small bone in her neck and causing her to become either unconscious or dead. He also inflicted substantial other violence to her person. After that, he dragged her across the grass separating the rear of the house from the granny flat, and used a key to the latter structure that he had previously stolen to enter it. As he was doing so, a young neighbour who was up and about at that time heard the offender abusing his mother about her contact with his children. The neighbour mistook the voice of the offender as being that of a woman, because it was high-pitched. That was in turn due to the fact that the offender was extremely agitated. The offender placed the body of his mother on the floor of those small premises where his brother would find her.
	
	
	Either in the home or in the granny flat, the offender carefully and neatly applied a large amount of duct tape to the entirety of the head of the deceased. Her mouth and nose were completely covered. There were two results.
	
	
	The first was that, if it was the case that at the time that act was done the deceased was unconscious but not dead, her death due to suffocation was prompt and inevitable.
	
	
	The second result was that the appearance of the head and face of the deceased was completely dehumanised. Indeed, to my mind, the appearance of the deceased after she was dealt with in that way was more distressing than the appearance of many deceased persons who suffer more obvious bodily injuries.
	
	
	It is noteworthy that it was not disputed in the trial that, at a family function some months before the murder, the offender told his brother that, if his mother did not cease contact with the offender’s children, the offender would “cut off her face”. I accept the submission of the Crown prosecutor that, by treating the deceased in the way that I have described on the morning of 14 February 2014, the offender symbolically made good on his threat.
	
	
	As I have said, the offence was planned, and prepared for, at the latest on the evening of 13 February 2014. It featured an act, meticulously performed, that would inevitably cause death by suffocation to any human being. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, at the time of the offence, the offender intended to kill his mother, rather than merely inflict grievous bodily harm upon her. In the circumstances that I have outlined, I respectfully consider that any alternative thesis is fanciful.
	
	
	Furthermore, I reject any possibility that the offender, on the evening when he prepared the backpack, and on the morning when he travelled to his mother’s home, had at those stages merely formed an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm, and only thereafter spontaneously decided to kill her. It is to be recalled that one of the items contained in the backpack in the possession of the offender the night before was duct tape; that is, the very material that was used to ensure that the deceased would be completely deprived of oxygen. Contrary to any alternative thesis, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, when he retired to bed on the evening of 13 February 2014, the offender had decided that he would bring the life of his mother to an end the following morning.
	
	
	Having done so, the offender left the premises, but not before he deliberately broke off keys that were in his possession in the locks of the sliding door of the granny flat. That meant that entry to those premises was significantly delayed later that day.
	
	
	Thereafter, he sent a number of text messages to his brother that were in the nature of demands for money. Contrary to the evidence of the offender at trial, I reject the proposition that they were sincere attempts to extort money from his brother. Rather, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that they were efforts to create a false trail, and to make it look as though the person who had murdered the mother of Mr Nenad Biljuh was a disgruntled creditor of his, rather than the offender. Again, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender had decided to adopt that strategy at the latest when he went to bed on the evening before the offence.
	
	
	In the meantime, Mr Nenad Biljuh and others were unable to contact the deceased as the day unfolded. They became more and more concerned about her, and eventually Mr Nenad Biljuh returned to the home from his work. There he found his mother in the circumstances that I have described. The recording of the triple 000 call that was played in the trial speaks eloquently of his suffering.
	
	
	Later that day, the offender travelled to various suburbs of Sydney. He attended a shopping centre at Burwood, and was captured on CCTV there. Later still, he met his estranged wife and took custody of his two children for the weekend. The three of them, along with his romantic partner at the time, enjoyed dinner together at a hotel in the west of Sydney. Later again, they checked into a motel in the same general part of the city.
	
	
	At 10:28 PM, the offender undertook a Google search for the lyrics of the well-known song “Motherless Child”, which has been recorded by, amongst many others, the folk singer Richie Havens and the blues guitarist Eric Clapton.
	
	
	I accept the evidence of the offender in the trial that that song had a particular emotional resonance for him. On the other hand, I completely reject his evidence that the undertaking of that internet search that evening was merely a matter of regrettable coincidence. Rather, I am satisfied that the offender undertook that search because he wished to reflect on the fact that, because he had murdered his mother earlier that day, he had made himself a motherless child.
	
	
	Later that evening, the police located the offender at the motel. He voluntarily accompanied them to a police station, and voluntarily engaged in a recorded interview with them. As I have said, that was the beginning of many lies.
	
	
	Quite soon after that, the police located the backpack and its contents, crudely concealed at the home where the offender had been staying.
	
	
	Later still, the offender was arrested on 6 March 2014, charged with murder, refused bail, and has been in custody ever since.
	


Objective seriousness of the offence


	
	I turn to evaluate the objective seriousness of this offence.
	
	
	Although all murders are examples of the most serious offence known to law, it is possible to create something of a ranking of the seriousness of all of them, without for a moment detracting from the gravity of any of them. And it is necessary to do so in order to give the maximum penalty and standard non-parole period some content as guideposts.
	
	
	Here, as I have said, the murder was planned. There was a settled intention to kill. The victim was an elderly woman. She was attacked in her own home. Being strangled into unconsciousness or death must surely be a terrifying ordeal for the victim. Although the body of the deceased was not mutilated, it was left in a gruesome and dehumanised state for her son to find. Subsequently, planned steps were taken in an effort to hide the guilt of the offender.
	
	
	By any measure, this must be assessed as an extremely grave example of the offence of murder. I consider that it is well above the middle range of objective seriousness of examples of the offence. Inevitably, denunciation of what the offender has done, and considerations of general and specific deterrence, must loom large in the sentence that I shall impose.
	


Subjective features


	
	I turn from a discussion of aspects of the offence to aspects of the life and character of the offender.
	


Attitude of the offender to what he has done


	
	The offender pleaded not guilty, and thereby exercised his right to trial by jury. He was perfectly entitled to do so, and, of course, is not to be punished for taking that approach.
	
	
	The offender gave evidence in the trial, though not in the proceedings on sentence. As I have said, regrettably much of what he said in the witness box was deliberately untrue. I record that the trial transcript by no means captures the atmosphere of incredulity that prevailed in the courtroom during some of his evidence, and in particular during parts of his cross-examination. Since the return of the verdict of guilty of murder, the offender has said or done nothing to suggest that he regrets what he has done, or even accepts responsibility for it. Indeed, he firmly maintains his innocence.
	


Background and family relationships


	
	Separately, the evidence about subjective matters came from what one could glean from the evidence in the trial; the criminal record of the offender; a psychiatric report prepared with regard to him; and, finally, oral evidence given in the proceedings on sentence by an old friend, Mr Phil Small.
	
	
	The Crown prosecutor did not dispute any of the matters of background contained in the psychiatric report. In light of the fact that neither the psychiatrist nor the offender was cross-examined about those matters, combined with my refusal to accept much of the evidence of the offender about contentious matters, I have approached the question of background with substantial caution. Nevertheless, I am prepared to accept the following matters on the balance of probabilities.
	
	
	The offender was born in May 1971, and accordingly was aged 42 at the date of the murder, and is now aged 44.
	
	
	His family are of Croatian background. They emigrated from the former Yugoslavia to Australia many years ago. I infer that, as a result of that disruption and the beginning of a new life in this country, the upbringing of the offender was not attended by privilege.
	
	
	For reasons that are not easy to discern on the evidence, the offender has had very difficult relationships with members of his family over many years. The ill-feeling was by no means limited to the relationship between the offender and his mother, though I consider that she was the subject of the most intense hatred on his part. Indeed, the evidence in the trial showed that there had been a very difficult relationship between the offender and his brother, and also between the offender and his sister, even before the events of 14 February 2014, which have no doubt completely destroyed any such relationship.
	
	
	There was undisputed evidence in the trial that the offender was in the habit of breaking into the granny flat occupied by his brother. There was also undisputed evidence that the offender firmly believed that his brother had defrauded him out of money. There was yet further undisputed evidence that, when Ms Gabriella Biljuh was recovering from a brain aneurysm, the offender told her that he wished she had suffered a worse one.
	
	
	In short, I consider it important that it is not the case that the relationship between the offender and the deceased was the only relationship in his life that was an unsatisfactory one; quite the contrary. That has relevance, I think, to the prospects of rehabilitation, and also to the question of future dangerousness.
	
	
	The offender has been married, and is the father of two children. That relationship broke down in 2009. At the time of the offence, the offender was, as I have said, in a romantic relationship with another woman; it is not clear whether that relationship has survived his incarceration.
	
	
	Mr Small gave evidence that he had known the offender from when they were young boys, and they had been close friends as young men. He knew that the offender achieved a trade qualification many years ago. The two of them had quite a deal of social contact in their early twenties, but thereafter their contact declined and became sporadic. The witness explained that, having read in the media of the offender being charged with murder, he made contact with him again. He has visited the offender in prison, and the offender often telephones him from custody. The young man whom Mr Small knew was an outgoing person, ready to help a friend, loyal, intelligent, and lively. The witness also gave evidence that he had never known the offender to be a violent person. I accept all of that evidence as truthful. In cross-examination, Mr Small accepted that, in the years before the commission of the offence, he had not really had much contact with the offender.
	


Criminal record


	
	I regard the criminal record of the offender as being broadly in his favour. It has a few entries, all of which are matters that were dealt with in the Local Court. In June 1992, when he was aged 21 years, he stole from a dwelling house and was sentenced to perform 100 hours of community work. More concerningly, in 2007, he was placed on a bond for the offence of intimidation. Finally, in 2011, he was fined for a number of driving offences, each of which was committed on the same occasion.
	
	
	It can be seen that in the past, the offender has never been convicted of an offence of actual violence, and he has never been convicted of an offence that remotely approaches the seriousness of the offence for which he will be sentenced today.
	
	
	In short, I approach the sentencing of the offender on the basis that, before he committed the most serious offence known to law, he had very largely been a person of good character, who had very largely avoided intersection with the criminal justice system.
	


Personal crisis at the time of the offence


	
	It was the Crown case at trial that, by the evening before the murder, the life of the offender had reached a point of crisis. He was unemployed; without funds; sleeping on a friend’s couch; seeing his children infrequently; in conflict with his wife with regard to the payment of school fees; believed that his mother had unfairly and disloyally taken the side of his wife in the breakdown of his marriage; believed that his brother had defrauded him; and was generally on very bad terms with his mother, his brother, and his sister. I accept that proposition, and consider that the fact that the offence occurred in that context of deep personal crisis plays some role in mitigation.
	


Psychological and psychiatric aspects


	
	As I have said, the proceedings on sentence were delayed so that psychiatric evidence about the offender could be received by me. I agreed to that course because I considered, on all of the material that I have already outlined, that the question of the psychiatric condition of the offender at the time of the commission of the offence could be a very significant one.
	
	
	A noteworthy aspect of the psychiatric report was that its author, Dr Carne, had treated the offender for a year, from August 2007 until August 2008, and therefore had direct knowledge of how the offender had presented over an extended period in the past. That treatment took place after a referral by the offender’s general practitioner.
	
	
	Before then, there had already been a suggestion that the offender had experienced problems with “low frustration tolerance, impulsivity, anxiety, recreational drug use, alcohol use and risk-taking behaviour”. A number of physiological investigations had been undertaken, none of which was conclusive. There was even earlier material to suggest that the offender had consulted another psychiatrist with regard to an “adjustment disorder with anxiety”, for which that psychiatrist had recommended medication and cognitive behavioural therapy.
	
	
	During the year in which the offender was treated by Dr Carne, his mood benefited from prescription medication. That psychiatrist also recommended marital counselling. Regrettably, the offender stopped seeing that psychiatrist; did not pursue marital counselling except perhaps on two or three occasions; stopped taking his medication; and, in the intervening years, drank alcohol quite heavily.
	
	
	In terms of current diagnosis, Dr Carne did not come to the view that the offender is suffering from any substantial mental condition, let alone any mental illness. It was said that the offender “has been diagnosed as having a personality disturbance characterised by poor impulse control, anger, anxiety and abuse of alcohol and recreational drugs”. I accept that diagnosis on the balance of probabilities; apart from anything else, much of it is completely consistent with the offence of which the offender has been found guilty.
	
	
	In light of the long-standing hatred of the offender for his mother; the circumstances of the offence; and the manner in which the body of the deceased was left, I suspect that there may well be a deep emotional or mental disturbance underpinning the catastrophic events of 14 February 2014. However, to be clear, each counsel submitted that there is no evidence before me upon which I could come to a mitigatory finding on the balance of probabilities that any emotional or mental condition or illness played a direct or indirect role in the commission of this murder. I accept that joint submission.
	


The future


	
	Turning to reflect upon the future, and in particular the prospects of rehabilitation of the offender, there are a number of adverse matters.
	
	
	The first and most important is that, regrettably, the offender is completely lacking in insight. Upon the delivery by the jury of its verdict, the offender expressed his shock and disagreement with it, an outburst for which he subsequently apologised through his counsel. As I said at the time, I do not hold that against him. But it is also the case that the offender recently described himself to the psychiatrist as continuing to be “gobsmacked” by that guilty verdict. In truth, the Crown case was so strong as to be virtually overwhelming.
	
	
	The fact that the offender – whom I assess as being an intelligent man – is unable to take responsibility for what he has done, and is unable to see that his guilt was plain at trial, is a matter of serious concern. In particular, it makes one wonder whether, in the many years of incarceration ahead, the offender will seek help, and try to rehabilitate himself.
	
	
	The second matter of serious concern is that, as I have said, the anger and ill will of the offender was by no means directed towards his mother only. It extended to at least two other people. In other words, it is not as if the offender bore some obsessive hatred for his mother only, which has now dissipated. In light of what has happened, and in light of the long-standing difficulties that the offender has experienced with regard to aggression and anger, there inevitably must be concerns about the future dangerousness of Mr Biljuh.
	
	
	To be weighed against those pessimistic aspects is the fact that the offender will have many years to reflect, not only upon the enormity of what he has done, but also upon the aspects of his life and personality that led him to do it. As I have said, in the past, he realised that he needed help, and expended quite a bit of time, trouble, and possibly money in order to receive it.
	
	
	Having reflected on the matter, I have come to the view on the balance of probabilities that, at some stage during his non-parole period, the offender will ask for psychological or psychiatric help. If that occurs, and if that help is able to be effective, one is entitled to leaven what I said a moment ago with some measure of optimism.
	
	
	Having said that, as things currently stand, I consider that the most that one can say in favour of the offender on this topic is that the future must be approached very guardedly.
	


Various aspects


	
	I turn now to discuss briefly various aspects of my task.
	
	
	First, these remarks on sentence set out all of the aggravating and mitigating features of the matter that I have found to exist. For that reason, I do not propose to engage mechanistically with s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
	
	
	Secondly, both counsel were agreed that the offender has been in continuous custody since his date of arrest; namely, 6 March 2014. My sentence will commence on that date.
	
	
	Thirdly, each counsel provided me with sentencing decisions in broadly similar matters. That was of assistance; but because sentencing is an exercise in intuitive synthesis of a number of factors, and each such exercise must turn on its own facts, I shall not pause to examine those other cases in any detail.
	
	
	Fourthly, defence counsel submitted that it would be open to me to find special circumstances that could lead to a shortening of the non-parole period. He invited my attention to the need for psychiatric help and medication in the past, and suggested that perhaps there should be a very extended period of conditional liberty in the future. So much may be accepted; but the inevitable length of the parole period that I shall impose shortly is, to my mind, sufficient for those purposes.
	
	
	Fifthly, I am required by s 25C of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) to inform the offender that it is possible that he will remain incarcerated even despite the complete expiry of his head sentence, if it is judged at that stage that he constitutes an unacceptable danger to the community.
	


Harm to the community


	
	Finally, speaking of the community, and the harm the offender has caused to it, it is true that no victim impact statements from any members of the family of the deceased were placed before me. But it cannot be controversial that this offence has inflicted substantial harm on the community, above and beyond the fatal harm inflicted upon the deceased herself.
	
	
	Quite apart from family and friends who loved the deceased and lost her in harrowing circumstances, it must surely be the case that people who lived near the deceased were unsettled and upset when they heard that an elderly woman had been strangled and suffocated to death in her own home. More broadly, I think that older members of the community who heard of the murder, even those living well away from Villawood, must have been frightened at the thought of what had occurred. And speaking even more generally, it must surely be seen as inflicting great harm upon the community when one of its members decides to murder another, plans and prepares for it, and thereafter does exactly that. As I have said, what the offender has done calls for significant denunciation.
	
	
	On behalf of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, I extend my condolences to all of those who have suffered as a result of the murder of Mrs Laura Biljuh. The conclusion of the proceedings today may provide a measure of relief; I accept that for some the pain will be unrelenting.
	


Imposition of sentence


	
	Dario Biljuh, you are convicted of the offence of murder.
	
	
	I sentence you to a non-parole period of 22 years 6 months, to date from 6 March 2014. That will be followed by a parole period of 7 years 6 months, to commence on 6 September 2036 and to expire on 5 March 2044. The first date upon which you will be eligible for release to parole is 5 September 2036.
	
	
	To express my sentence another way, I have imposed a head sentence of imprisonment for 30 years to commence on 6 March 2014, with a non-parole period of 22 years 6 months.

Introduction


	
	By summons filed on 28 October 2015 the plaintiff sought orders against the defendant which included the following:
	


“1. An order pursuant to cl. 6(5)(a) of Schedule 1 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (“the Act”):

a. appointing two qualified psychiatrists to conduct separate examinations of the defendant and to furnish reports to the Supreme Court on the result of those examinations by a date to be fixed by the court; and

b. directing the defendant to attend those examinations.

2. An order:

a. pursuant to cl. 10 of Schedule 1 of the Act, that the defendant be subject to an interim extension order from 12 December 2015 (“the interim extension order”); and

b. pursuant to cl. 11(1) of Schedule 1 of the Act, that the interim extension order be for a period of 28 days.”


	
	The defendant consented, without admissions, to the making of these orders. The last date on which the orders set out in prayers 1 and 2 of the summons can be made is 12 December 2015 since the defendant is due to be released on that day on the expiry of the limiting term. The defendant is currently a forensic patient at the Forensic Hospital at Long Bay.
	
	
	The plaintiff also seeks an extension order in respect of the defendant for a period of five years from the date of the order pursuant to cl 7(1)(a) of Schedule 1 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW) (the Forensic Provisions Act). However, whether it is appropriate to make such an order does not arise for present consideration since the matter is before me for preliminary hearing only at this stage.
	


The facts

The index offence


	
	The defendant is a forensic patient by reason of the commission of an offence of reckless wounding on 13 December 2012 (the index offence). The defendant followed the victim into his apartment building in Redfern at 5am and travelled with the victim in the lift up to the floor where the victim’s apartment was. The victim was unlocking the front door to his apartment when the defendant pushed him to the ground. The defendant stabbed the victim several times with a knife. He followed him into the apartment. There was a struggle, in the course of which the defendant stabbed the victim several more times. The victim called Triple-0. The defendant left the building. His departure was recorded on CCTV.
	
	
	At the time of the index offence, the defendant had not been long at liberty. He had previously been incarcerated for a limiting term of 12 months which expired on 26 June 2012 for conduct that occurred on 24 March 2010. At the time of his release he had lived in supported accommodation arranged by the Community Justice Program (CJP). However, in September 2012 he left that accommodation, moved to Moree, and subsequently travelled to Sydney where he committed the index offence.
	
	
	On 29 July 2013 Solomon DCJ found the defendant unfit to be tried and referred him to the Mental Health Review Tribunal (the Tribunal). On 17 September 2013 the Tribunal found him unfit to be tried and ordered his transfer to the Forensic Hospital.
	


The special hearing and the indication of a limiting term


	
	As the defendant was found unfit to be tried, the matter proceeded as a special hearing before Judge Tupman pursuant to s 19 of the Forensic Provisions Act. Her Honour held that, on the limited evidence available, the defendant committed the alternative offence of reckless wounding. Her Honour acquitted him of the more serious charge of assault with intent to rob armed with offensive weapon and wounding.
	
	
	On 20 June 2014, Tupman DCJ indicated, pursuant to s 23 (1)(a) of the Forensic Provisions Act, that, had the special hearing proceeded as a normal trial and had the defendant been found guilty, she would have imposed a term of imprisonment of three years. Accordingly, her Honour indicated a limiting term of three years to expire on 12 December 2015. Her Honour referred the defendant to the Tribunal pursuant to s 24(1)(a) of the Forensic Provisions Act and ordered, pursuant to s 24(1)(b), that he be detained in such place as the Tribunal directed. Accordingly, he became a forensic patient by reason of the operation of s 42 of the Forensic Provisions Act.
	


Reviews undertaken by the Tribunal


	
	The Tribunal is obliged, by s 46 of the Forensic Provisions Act, to review the case of a forensic patient every six months but may review the case of any forensic patient at any time. The Tribunal reviewed the defendant on eight occasions, most recently on 30 July 2015. On 30 July 2015 the Tribunal’s reasons for its determination included the following:
	



	
	the defendant currently presents a significant risk of further offending if he is discharged into the community without suitable accommodation and an appropriate treatment plan;
	
	
	the defendant does not believe he has a mental illness or needs medication;
	
	
	the defendant suffers from delusions (including that he is God and that he has fathered hundreds of children);
	
	
	he has indecently exposed himself persistently while in custody;
	
	
	the treating team requested that the defendant be transferred to the Long Bay Forensic Hospital so that therapeutic programs could be investigated;
	
	
	CJP have accommodation available for the defendant at Blacktown although he could not be managed in his present condition at that accommodation;
	
	
	it was likely that an order under s 53 of the Forensic Provisions Act (that he be classified as an involuntary patient – see below) would be sought by the defendant’s solicitor.
	


Guardianship order


	
	A guardianship order was made in respect of the defendant on 13 April 2015 by the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal. The Public Guardian was appointed with the following functions: to decide whether the defendant may reside; to advocate generally for him; to make substitute decisions regarding medical and dental treatment for the defendant; to make decisions about the defendant’s freedom of movement when he is discharged from Long Bay Hospital; and to make decisions about services to be provided to him.
	


The defendant’s criminal history and other matters germane to risk of harm to others


	
	The defendant has a criminal history which involves stalking, intimidation and assault of strangers.
	
	
	In 2010 the defendant was charged with stalking, intimidation and committing an act of indecency and behaving in an offensive manner. He was alleged to have approached a woman who was pushing her 11-month old daughter in a pram. He followed her to her apartment and waited outside her door. He removed his clothes and masturbated. She called the police who arrested him in the stairwell. On 12 August 2011 the charges were dismissed in the Local Court under s 32 of the Forensic Provisions Act on the basis that the defendant was mentally ill.
	
	
	On 23 March 2010 in Seven Hills, a woman woke at 4.30am to see the defendant standing naked in her lounge room with the light on. The defendant then turned the light off and, when she turned her bedroom light on, she saw him standing in front of her, holding a large kitchen knife above her head. When she asked the defendant what he wanted, he answered, “To have a baby with you.” The woman managed to run out through her front door. Judge Keleman imposed a limiting term of 12 months which expired on 26 June 2012. As referred to above, the index offence was committed about six months after the defendant’s release following the expiry of the limiting term imposed by Keleman DCJ.
	


Relevant statutory provisions

The jurisdiction to make an extension order


	
	Part 5 of the Forensic Provisions Act, which deals with forensic and correctional patients, provides, by s 40, that the objects of the Part include the protection of the safety of members of the public. Section 54A provides for the extension of the status as a forensic patient of a person in accordance with Sch 1. Clause 3 of Sch 1 permits the Minister administering Part 5 of the Act, to apply to this Court for an extension order against a forensic patient.
	
	
	The term “forensic patient” is defined in s 42 of the Forensic Provisions Act. It includes a person who is found unfit to be tried who is detained. Because the defendant was the subject of a limiting term and was detained in custody pursuant to an order made under s 24, he is a forensic patient.
	
	
	Section 53 of the Forensic Provisions Act provides:
	


“Classification as involuntary patient

(1) The Tribunal may, on a review of the case of a forensic patient detained in a mental health facility, correctional centre or other place following a special hearing, classify the patient as an involuntary patient if the patient would, by virtue of the operation of this Act or any other law, cease to be a forensic patient within 6 months after the date of the review.

(2) The Tribunal may order that a patient classified as an involuntary patient under this section be transferred from a correctional centre to a mental health facility.

Note. A person classified as an involuntary patient ceases to be a forensic patient, see section 52 (2).”


	
	Section 54 of the Forensic Provisions Act provides:
	


“Release from mental health facility on ceasing to be a forensic patient

A person who ceases to be a forensic patient (other than a person classified as an involuntary patient under section 53) must be discharged from the mental health facility in which the person is detained.”


	
	The Forensic Provisions Act confers power on this Court to make an extension order if the forensic patient is subject to a limiting term or an existing extension order: cll 1 and 4, Sch 1. The test for making an extension order is set out in cl 2 of Schedule 1, as follows:
	


“Forensic patients in respect of whom extension orders may be made

(1) A forensic patient can be made the subject of an extension order as provided for by this Schedule if and only if the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that:

(a) the forensic patient poses an unacceptable risk of causing serious harm to others if he or she ceases being a forensic patient, and

(b) the risk cannot be adequately managed by other less restrictive means (including classification as an involuntary patient under section 53).

(2) The Supreme Court is not required to determine that the risk of a person causing serious harm to others is more likely than not in order to determine that the person poses an unacceptable risk of causing serious harm to others.”


	
	Clause 7(2) of Sch 1 provides:
	


“In determining whether or not to make an extension order, the Supreme Court must have regard to the following matters in addition to any other matter it considers relevant:

(a) the safety of the community,

(b) the reports received from the persons appointed under clause 6 (5) to conduct examinations of the forensic patient,

(c) the report of the qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner provided under clause 5 (b),

(d) any other report of a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner provided in support of the application or by the forensic patient,

(e) any order or decision made by the Tribunal with respect to the forensic patient that is relevant to the application,

(f) any report of the Director-General of the Ministry of Health, the Commissioner of Corrective Services, the Director-General of the Department of Family and Community Services or any other government Department or agency responsible for the detention, care or treatment of the forensic patient,

(g) the level of the forensic patient’s compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject while a forensic patient (including while released from custody subject to conditions and while on a leave of absence in accordance with section 49 or 50),

(h) the views of the court that imposed the limiting term or existing extension order on the forensic patient at the time the limiting term or extension order was imposed,

(i) any other information that is available as to the risk that the forensic patient will in future cause serious harm to others.”


	
	On the making of an extension order, the Court is neither required nor permitted to determine whether the order is one for detention of the individual or supervision within the community. It is for the Tribunal to determine these matters. Once an extension order has been made, it may be varied or revoked by the Court, on the application of either of the parties or on the recommendation of the Tribunal, under s 47(2A) of the Forensic Provisions Act: cl 12, Sch 1.
	


The procedure for applying for and making an extension order


	
	An application for an extension order must be made within the last six months of a forensic patient’s limiting term or of any existing extension order: cl 4(2), Sch 1.
	
	
	The applicant for an extension order is required to furnish to the Court documentation that addresses, to the extent relevant, each of the matters referred to in cl 7(2) and a report from a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner that assesses the risk of the forensic patient causing serious harm to others; the need for ongoing management of the patient as a forensic patient; and the reasons why the risk of the forensic patient causing serious harm to others cannot be adequately managed by other less restrictive means: cl 5, Sch 1.
	
	
	Proceedings under Sch 1 are civil proceedings and are to be conducted in accordance with the law relating to civil proceedings (including the rules of evidence): cl 13, Sch 1.
	
	
	The Forensic Provisions Act requires a preliminary hearing into the application within 28 days after the application is filed or within such further time as the Court allows: cl 6(4), Sch 1. If, following a preliminary hearing, the Court is satisfied that the matters alleged in the application would, if proved, justify the making of an extension order, the Court must appoint independent clinical experts to conduct examinations of the forensic patient and to furnish reports to the Court: cl 6(5), Sch 1. If not so satisfied, the Court must dismiss the application: cl 6(6).
	
	
	Clause 10 of Sch 1 provides that the Court may make an interim extension order of the defendant’s status as a forensic patient if the limiting term will expire before the proceedings are determined and the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of an extension order.
	


Orders that may be made by the Tribunal in respect of forensic patients for release


	
	Section 47 of the Forensic Provisions Act empowers the Tribunal, after reviewing the case of a forensic patient under s 46, to make an order, including an order for the patient’s release, either conditionally or unconditionally. Leave of absence may also be granted pursuant to s 49, subject to safety considerations outlined in the section. Section 43 prohibits the Tribunal from making an order for release of a forensic patient unless it is satisfied that the safety of the patient or the public will not be endangered and:
	


“other care of a less restrictive kind, that is consistent with safe and effective care, is appropriate and reasonably available to the patient or that the patient does not require care.”


	
	The Tribunal may, under s 75 of the Forensic Provisions Act, impose a range of conditions as part of a conditional release order, including the appointment of a case manager. Conditions may also be imposed that relate to care and treatment; medication; accommodation; non-use of alcohol; drug testing; and agreements as to conduct. Prohibitions or restrictions on visiting certain places or associating with certain people may also be imposed.
	
	
	Section 74 of the Forensic Provisions Act requires the Tribunal to have regard to certain matters when determining what order to make about a person, which include: whether the person is suffering from a mental illness or other mental condition; whether there are reasonable grounds for believing that care, treatment or control of the person is necessary for the person’s own protection from serious harm or the protection of others from serious harm; the continuing condition of the person, including any likely deterioration in the person’s condition, and the likely effects of any such deterioration; and a report of a forensic psychiatrist.
	


Involuntary detention and treatment in a mental health facility under the Mental Health Act 2007 (NSW)


	
	Part 2 of the Mental Health Act provides for involuntary detention and treatment of patients in mental health facilities. An involuntary patient is defined as:
	


“(a) a person who is ordered to be detained as an involuntary patient after a mental health inquiry or otherwise by the Tribunal, or

(b) a forensic patient who is re-classified as an involuntary patient under section 53 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, or

(c) a correctional patient who is re-classified as an involuntary patient under section 65 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990.”


	
	For present purposes it is sufficient to refer to the provisions that require that, before a person becomes an involuntary patient, he or she must be a “mentally ill person” or a “mentally disordered person”. For a person to be “mentally ill” the person must be suffering from “mental illness”. The term “mental illness” is defined in s 4 of the Mental Health Act to mean:
	


“a condition that seriously impairs, either temporarily or permanently, the mental functioning of a person and is characterised by the presence in the person of any one or more of the following symptoms:

(a) delusions,

(b) hallucinations,

(c) serious disorder of thought form,

(d) a severe disturbance of mood,

(e) sustained or repeated irrational behaviour indicating the presence of any one or more of the symptoms referred to in paragraphs (a)–(d).”

Community treatment orders under the Mental Health Act


	
	The Mental Health Act makes provision for community treatment orders in respect of “affected persons”. Such orders authorise compulsory treatment of persons in the community. Section 53(4) provides that the Tribunal may not make a community treatment order unless it is of the opinion that the person is a “mentally ill person”.
	


Relevant provisions under the Guardianship Act 1987


	
	Section 4 of the Guardianship Act provides in part that it is the duty of everyone exercising functions under this Act with respect to persons who have disabilities to observe the following principles:
	



	
	the welfare and interests of such persons should be given paramount consideration: s 4(a);
	
	
	the freedom of decision and freedom of action of such persons should be restricted as little as possible: s 4(b); and
	
	
	such persons should be encouraged, as far as possible, to live a normal life in the community.
	



	
	Part 5 of the Guardianship Act governs the provision of medical and dental treatment. Section 36 authorises a responsible person, including a guardian (or the Tribunal), to provide consent to the carrying out of medical treatment (minor and major). If a patient objects to the carrying out of medical treatment, the consent of the guardian has no effect (s 46(2)(a)) unless the patient has minimal or no understanding of what the treatment entails and the treatment will cause the patient no distress or reasonable tolerable and transitory distress (s 46(4)). The patient’s objection may also be overridden if the Tribunal has conferred on the guardian a power to override (s 46A(1)), such power being conferred only if the Tribunal is satisfied that the objection will be made by the patient because of a lack of understanding as to the nature of, or reason for, the treatment (s 46A(2)).
	


Relevant authorities


	
	I was referred to decisions of this Court in which the Forensic Provisions Act was considered. Judicial consideration of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) (the High Risk Offenders Act) is of particular relevance where the same, or similar, wording is used: see, for example: Attorney General of New South Wales v McGuire [2013] NSWSC 1862 by Davies J at [12]. Guidance as to the meaning of “high degree of probability” under the Forensic Provisions Act can, accordingly, be obtained from a consideration of its meaning in the High Risk Offenders Act. In Cornwall v Attorney General for New South Wales [2007] NSWCA 374 (a decision under the High Risk Offenders Act), the Court of Appeal (Mason P, Giles and Hodgson JJA) said at [21]:
	


“The expression ‘a high degree of probability' indicates something 'beyond more probably than not', so that the existence of the risk, that is the likelihood of the offender committing a further serious sex offence, does have to be proved to a higher degree than the normal civil standard of proof, though not to the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt ...""


	
	The question whether “the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of an extension order” also arises under the High Risk Offenders Act. The Court of Appeal in Attorney General for the State of New South Wales v Tillman [2007] NSWCA 119; 70 NSWLR 448, said of similar wording in the High Risk Offenders Act at [98]:
	


“In determining whether the power to grant an interim order is enlivened, the Court is not involved in weighing that documentation or predicting the ultimate result. The power is enlivened if the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of either category of final order bearing in mind the elevated standard of proof stated in ss17(2) and (3) [of the High Risk Offenders Act]. That threshold question is to be resolved without considering what evidence might be called by the offender at the final hearing. Indeed, it is to be considered without taking into account the evidence (if any) called by the offender at the interim hearing: such evidence may go to (relevant) discretionary matters, but would not cast light upon what is alleged in the Attorney General’s supporting documentation.” 

[Emphasis added.]


	
	The phrase “unacceptable risk” is not defined in the Forensic Provisions Act. However, it is a common expression in Bail Acts: see, for example, Div 2 of Part 3, Bail Act 2013 (NSW). It is clear from the express terms of cl 2(1)(a) in the Forensic Provisions Act that the unacceptable risk is that of “causing serious harm to others”.
	


Consideration


	
	As referred to above, an interim extension order can be made following a preliminary hearing if I am satisfied that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of an extension order. In other words, before I can make an interim extension order I must be satisfied that the supporting documentation is capable of satisfying the Court (at a final hearing) to a “high degree of probability” of the following two matters:
	



	
	that the defendant poses an unacceptable risk of causing serious harm to others if he ceases being a forensic patient; and
	
	
	that the risk cannot be adequately managed by other less restrictive means (including classification as an involuntary patient under s 53 of the Forensic Provisions Act).
	



	
	I propose to address such matters in s 7(2) as are relevant for the purpose of considering whether I am satisfied that the supporting documentation is capable of establishing that there is a high degree of probability that the defendant poses an unacceptable risk of causing serious harm to others if he ceases being a forensic patient and that the risk cannot be managed by less restrictive means.
	


The safety of the community (s 7(2)(a))


	
	The defendant’s criminal history supports the making of the order. The impulsive, anti-social, violent and sexual acts referred to above indicate that there is a risk of serious harm to persons in the community if the defendant ceases to be a forensic patient.
	


Reports received from medical experts (s 7(2)(d))


	
	The defendant’s treating psychiatrist, Dr Kerri Eagle, assessed the defendant’s risk of violent re-offending to be high in the short and longer term. This view is consistent with those expressed by others who have treated the defendant during his limiting term
	
	
	Dr Richard Parker (psychologist) and Ms Danielle Matsuo (forensic psychologist) assessed the defendant, at the request of the plaintiff’s solicitors, for the purposes of the proceedings. They recorded that the defendant persistently engages in inappropriate sexual behaviour towards female staff.
	
	
	Dr Andrew Ellis (psychiatrist), who assessed the defendant for the purposes of these proceedings at the request of the plaintiff’s solicitors, diagnosed schizophrenia, neurocognitive disorder, substance abuse disorder and anti-social personality disorder. He noted that the defendant admitted to him that he intended to kill the victim of the index offence. Dr Ellis considered that the defendant would be unable to abstain from the use of prohibited substances outside a supervised environment and noted the contribution made to the defendant’s offending conduct by such substances. Dr Ellis also noted that sexual disinhibition was a feature of the defendant’s offending conduct.
	
	
	There appears to be a consensus amongst medical experts, including the defendant’s treating doctors, that he is at high risk of violent re-offending. For example, at the Tribunal’s review on 19 February 2015, Dr Jones, forensic psychiatrist, opined that the defendant would probably remain “at high chronic risk”.
	


The views of the court that imposed the limiting term on the defendant at the time it was imposed: cl 7(2)(h)


	
	Judge Tupman (who imposed the limiting term for the index offence) considered that the defendant posed a risk of violence in the community due to his inability to control his behaviour or make appropriate judgments as a consequence of his mental illness and intellectual disability. Her Honour considered the defendant’s prospects of rehabilitation to be “almost nil because of his chronic mental illness”. Her Honour noted that the defendant had an acquired head injury as a result of a significant head injury he suffered when he was about 18 (as a result of being hit with an iron bar), which rendered him comatose for a period of six months. Her Honour also recorded that the defendant had an extensive history of substance abuse which included smoking cannabis from the age of seven; using amphetamines and methamphetamines between the ages of 16 and 27; and using heroin.
	
	
	Judge Tupman said, in her reasons for imposing the limiting term:
	


“It is to be hoped and I plead with the authorities, to ensure that this offender is properly monitored and considered for the balance of the limiting term and then, when that expires in December 2015, in relation to any decision to release him from custody into any other form of living, It would appear to be without doubt that his release on the last occasion before he committed this offence was done without proper regard for his chronic condition, without monitoring, without consideration of appropriate placement and without the imposition of a community treatment order. It is hardly surprising therefore that he committed this serious offence and it is to be hoped that the authorities do not let such a situation occur in the future.”

Any other information that is available as to the risk that the forensic patient will in future cause serious harm to others: cl 7(2)(i)


	
	The defendant’s criminal history is significant because it shows that the index offence was not an isolated impulsive act but can be seen as a further instance of unprovoked aggressive, sexual conduct against strangers. I am entitled to take into account the allegations of criminal conduct (even where they did not result in a conviction) on the question of risk, since the Forensic Provisions Act does not limit the assessment of safety to conduct that has resulted in a criminal conviction.
	
	
	The team currently responsible for treating the defendant prepared a report dated 22 October 2015 for the Tribunal. The report outlines various means that are being contemplated to treat the defendant, including that he take Clozapine and that he be required to undertake a behavioural management plan. Dr Eagle expressed the opinion that the defendant “needs ongoing treatment and management in a high secure forensic setting such as the Forensic Hospital”, which was “the least restrictive reasonably available form of care in the circumstances”.
	


Other matters


	
	I also take into account the circumstance that the defendant consents (without admissions) to the orders in prayers 1 and 2 of the summons.
	


Conclusion as to whether the matters in the supporting documentation would, if proved, be capable of establishing unacceptable risk to the requisite standard


	
	On the basis of the matters referred to above I am satisfied that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation referred to above would, if proved, establish to a high degree of probability that the defendant poses an unacceptable risk of causing serious harm to others if he ceases to be a forensic patient. His lack of insight, lack of impulse control and past conduct indicate that the risk of his assaulting, including sexually assaulting, another person is high unless he is living in a highly regulated and controlled environment. He has little, if any, capacity either to moderate his conduct or impulses; to resist the urge to abuse substances if they are available; or to resist the sexual urge if it arises in circumstances where he considers that he has the opportunity to satisfy it. Indeed, such is his compromised state, I do not consider that it can be regarded as being in his interests to be at liberty at all, unless the “liberty”, such as it is, is strictly controlled.
	


“Less restrictive” means available to manage the risk posed by the defendant


	
	The plaintiff submitted that, in the context of the present case, means which might be regarded as “less restrictive” than an extension of the defendant’s status as a forensic patient comprised either: classification of the defendant as an involuntary patient; or guardianship with an arrangement for secure accommodation supervised by CJP. The relevant statutory provisions for these two options are set out above.
	
	
	The plaintiff submitted that neither of these means would be sufficient to manage the risk posed by the defendant. No “less restrictive” means were contended for on behalf of the defendant at the interim hearing.
	
	
	Dr Ellis compared the access to treatment and assistance that would be available to the defendant if an order was made extending his term as a forensic patient, compared with the situation if he were declared an involuntary patient. He concluded:
	


“Remaining on a forensic order moves the oversight from individual clinicians in health services to the automatic oversight of the forensic arm of the Mental Health Review Tribunal. This does guarantee the interest of the Forensic Mental Health Network and its specialist clinicians in the case. There is evidence that specialist forensic mental health care improves offending outcomes.”


	
	Dr Parker and Ms Matsuo concluded, in their report of 22 October 2015, that:
	


“As such, from a psychological risk management perspective, I would consider that Mr Doolan requires ongoing management as a Forensic Patient. While he would likely be committed as an involuntary patient, if such an order was not imposed, if his psychosis improved, he could then be released into the community, where he would pose a substantial risk. Ongoing management as a Forensic Patient is the least restrictive care which will provide adequate protection to the community.”


	
	Dr Eagle’s opinion was set out in a report dated 22 October 2015 which was prepared for the hearing before the Tribunal on 29 October 2015. Dr Eagle said, of present relevance:
	


“Given Mr Doolan’s ongoing psychosis, intellectual impairment and ongoing problematic behaviours (such as aggressive sexual behaviours); and his other clinical risk factors (such as instability, poor insight and poor treatment response), he remains a risk of danger in a less restrictive setting. In my opinion, Mr Doolan requires ongoing treatment and management in a high secure forensic setting such as the Forensic Hospital and the Forensic Hospital is the least restrictive reasonably available form of care in the circumstances.”


	
	I accept the plaintiff’s submission that classifying the defendant as an involuntary patient under the Mental Health Act would not adequately manage the risk he poses of causing serious harm to others. I am satisfied, on the basis of the evidence before me (which has not been challenged), that the risk posed by the defendant cannot adequately be managed by other less restrictive means (including classification as an involuntary patient under s 53).
	


Conclusion


	
	In my view the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of an extension order. I am persuaded that it is appropriate, in these circumstances, to make an interim extension order for the maximum period allowed of 28 days.
	
	
	I emphasise that this is a preliminary hearing. My view that an interim extension order is appropriate is not intended to foreclose a contrary view being reached at a later interim application or at the final hearing in the context of further evidence (which will include the reports which I have ordered be prepared and furnished to the Court) and more developed submissions.
	
	
	In light of the view to which I have come, I am obliged by cl 6, Sch 1 to appoint two qualified professionals to conduct examinations of the defendant and furnish reports to the Court on the results of those examinations and to direct the defendant to attend such examinations.
	


Application for an order that the defendant’s name be anonymised


	
	Ms Dalumpines, who appeared on behalf of the defendant, asked that the defendant’s name be anonymised in this judgment. She did not make an application under the Court (Suppression and Non-Publication Orders) Act 2010 (NSW) (the 2010 Act). Rather, she submitted that I ought anonymise his name because of the provisions of s 162 of the Mental Health Act.
	
	
	Section 162 is contained in Pt 2 of Chapter 6 of the Mental Health Act. Chapter 6 is entitled “Mental Health Review Tribunal”. Part 2 is entitled “Procedures of the Tribunal”. Section 4 defines “the Tribunal” as “the Mental Health Review Tribunal”. Section 149, which is the first section in Part 2, provides:
	


“149 Application of Part

This Part, and any regulations made under this Part, apply to any proceedings of the Tribunal under this or any other Act.”


	
	Section 162 provides:
	


“162 Publication of names

(1) A person must not, except with the consent of the Tribunal, publish or broadcast the name of any person:

(a) to whom a matter before the Tribunal relates, or

(b) who appears as a witness before the Tribunal in any proceedings, or

(c) who is mentioned or otherwise involved in any proceedings under this Act or the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990,

whether before or after the hearing is completed.

Maximum penalty:

(a) in the case of an individual—50 penalty units or imprisonment for 12 months, or both, or

(b) in the case of a corporation—100 penalty units.

(2) This section does not prohibit the publication or broadcasting of an official report of the proceedings of the Tribunal that includes the name of any person the publication or broadcasting of which would otherwise be prohibited by this section.

(3) For the purposes of this section, a reference to the name of a person includes a reference to any information, picture or material that identifies the person or is likely to lead to the identification of the person.”


	
	Ms Wright, who appeared on behalf of the plaintiff, neither supported nor opposed the anonymisation of the defendant’s name. She directed me to decisions of this Court where the defendant’s name was anonymised but noted that this had occurred in circumstances where the anonymisation was neither opposed nor the subject of full argument. Ms Wright did not contend that s 162 applied in terms to the present case. Ms Dalumpines contended that I had a discretion to anonymise the defendant’s name, which I should exercise to save him from future embarrassment as a result of the disclosure of the facts on the basis of which the orders are made. She did not, however, contend that the wording of s 162 made the provision applicable to the present case.
	
	
	I was referred to Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales v XY [2014] NSWCA 466, in which the Attorney-General appealed to the Court of Appeal pursuant to s 77A(6) of the Forensic Provisions Act, which entitles the Attorney-General to appeal from a determination of the Mental Health Review Tribunal under the Forensic Provisions Act as to the release of a person.
	
	
	In Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales v XY McColl JA indicated that her Honour would revoke the non-publication order made on 27 October 2014 pursuant to the 2010 Act with respect to the identity of the respondent. Her Honour, without deciding whether an order was otherwise warranted under the 2010 Act, concluded that such an order was not necessary, having regard to s 162 of the Mental Health Act. Of present relevance, her Honour said, at [187]:
	


“It may be accepted that s 162 applies to the proceedings in this court, so that it is appropriate that this judgment not use the respondent’s name. However, for this court to make any order to that effect is not merely otiose, but might be thought to affect the Tribunal’s power to consent.”


	
	The issue was not addressed by the other two judges of the Court of Appeal (Beazley P and Basten JA) in Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales v XY.
	
	
	Even if McColl JA can be taken as holding (as opposed to merely accepting) that s 162 applied to an appeal to the Court of Appeal from a decision of the Tribunal to release a person, it does not follow that s 162 applies to proceedings in this Court under the Forensic Provisions Act. In my view, the wording of s 149 is sufficient to establish that s 162 was not intended to apply to the present proceedings, since they are neither “proceedings of the Tribunal”, nor are they an appeal from a decision of the Tribunal. The Tribunal has no power to make an extension order as sought in the proceedings before this Court. Clause 1 of Sch 1 of the Forensic Provisions Act grants exclusive jurisdiction to this Court to make such an order. Accordingly, in my view, s 162 does not apply to the present proceedings.
	
	
	In these circumstances, it is not, in my view, necessary to determine whether the word “person” in s 162 includes a court, particularly as I have not heard full argument on the question. I note, however, that the word “person” would not appear to include a court: see Kizon v Palmer (1997) 72 FCR 409 at 430-431 (per Lindgren J, Jenkinson and Kiefel JJ agreeing) and s 21 of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW).
	
	
	Although there are decisions of single judges of this Court where the name of a person in respect of whom an application for an extension order has been made has been anonymised, I do not regard the jurisdiction to make such an order as deriving from s 162, which, in my view, has no application to the present case. Section 4 of the 2010 Act expressly preserves the inherent jurisdiction of this Court, which would include a power to anonymise the names of litigants. However, I do not consider that it is appropriate to exercise this Court’s jurisdiction to do so in the present case, particularly where no application has been made under the 2010 Act. The principles of open justice are fundamental and ought not be required to give way without substantial cause.

		26 November 2015",2015-11-24 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2241993,R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 18) [2015] NSWSC 1625,"Judgment (on application by crown for tendency and coincidence directions -t2032)


	
	JOHNSON J: The Crown makes application that evidence already before the jury be used for tendency and coincidence purposes in the trials of KM and A2, and that the jury be so directed.
	
	
	The Crown served tendency and coincidence notices, for the purposes of ss.97, 98 and 99 Evidence Act 1995, upon the legal representatives for the Accused persons on 22 July 2015.
	
	
	I have had regard to the Crown submissions on these topics (pretrial MFI34) and draft written directions provided by the Crown (MFIs108, 109, 110 and 111) together with oral submissions made by counsel.
	
	
	The evidence in question, which is already before the jury, cannot be used for tendency or coincidence purposes unless the respective requirements of ss.97 and 98 are satisfied: s.95 Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	Here, several counts are being tried together. Each of KM and A2 are charged with female genital mutilation (“FGM”) offences under s.45 Crimes Act 1900 (and alternative counts) against C1 and C2. In the absence of any other direction, the jury would be directed to consider the evidence relevant to one girl without regard to evidence concerning the charges relating to the other girl.
	
	
	In seeking tendency and/or coincidence directions, the Crown seeks to have the evidence cross-admissible as between the counts for each complainant: El-Haddad v R [2015] NSWCCA 10; 88 NSWLR 93 at 105-106 [40]-[43].
	
	
	I should observe, once again, that the issues in dispute in this trial, certainly with respect to KM and A2, are relatively narrow. There is no dispute that KM, in the presence of and at the request of A2, did something with a metal instrument to each girl. The Crown says that what was happening was “khatna” (or circumcision) involving a cut or nick to the clitoris (or, at least, to the genital area). The defence assert that what was happening was a form of symbolic “khatna”, where no cut or nick resulted. The limited areas of contest have been mentioned in earlier trial judgments: R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 9) [2015] NSWSC 1491 at [9]-[11].
	
	
	The principles to be applied on this application are not in doubt, and may be found in decisions including DSJ v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2012] NSWCCA 9; 215 A Crim R 349; R v Gale; R v Duckworth [2012] NSWCCA 174; 217 A Crim R 487; R v MR [2013] NSWCCA 236 and El-Haddad v R.
	
	
	It has been observed that there is an overlap between the tendency and coincidence rules, and that there is an awkwardness in separating tendency and coincidence evidence where there is no dispute as to the identity of the alleged offender, but what is in issue is whether the offences occurred: El-Haddad v R at 107 [46].
	
	
	In this case, not only is there no dispute as to the identity of the Accused persons, KM and A2, but there is no dispute as to what happened on each occasion, except for the critical controversy as to what precisely was done to each girl. This is a somewhat unusual context in which issues of tendency and coincidence arise for consideration.
	


The Tendency Issue


	
	The tendency sought to be proved against KM is a tendency to act in a particular way, namely:
	



	
	to perform procedures that amount to FGM;
	
	
	to perform such procedures against prepubescent female children;
	
	
	to do so during the New South Wales public school holidays;
	
	
	to do so while the child is laying down on a bed;
	
	
	to do so in a private house, not a clinic or hospital;
	
	
	to do so while other women, related to the child are in the room; and
	
	
	to generally not speak about such procedures in the greater public.
	



	
	In this trial, topic (a) from this list is the real issue in dispute. As I understand the case of KM (who has given evidence), other listed aspects are not in contest.
	
	
	The Crown seeks to rely on two areas of evidence in support of a tendency direction against KM:
	



	
	the evidence of each of C1 and C2 concerning the relevant events affecting each girl;
	
	
	a body of less precise evidence which, the Crown contends, discloses the tendency on the part of KM to perform FGM in the Dawoodi Bohra community (see items listed in paragraph 2 of MFI108).
	



	
	The evidence in the second category (at [13](b)) does not include direct evidence of the performance by KM of “khatna” involving injury to a girl. The Crown relies upon some parts of intercepted telephone conversations and some evidence of KM concerning a girl, A10.
	
	
	This evidence may be seen as having probative value, but s.97(1)(b) requires that the evidence have significant probative value. If it has, s.101(2) requires that the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the Accused person.
	
	
	In circumstances where this body of evidence is relatively imprecise, and keeping in mind the real issues in dispute in the trial, I am not persuaded that a tendency direction should be given by reference to the body of evidence concerning KM referred to at [13](b).
	
	
	I have reached a different view with respect to the evidence of C1 and C2 (at [13](a)). In the practical context of this trial, should the jury be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt concerning FGM or the alternative charge with respect to C1, then that conclusion may be taken into account by the jury for tendency purposes, in reaching a verdict concerning the corresponding count for C2.
	
	
	Although the reverse approach would also be available to the jury, the reality is that there is a greater body of evidence on the counts concerning C1 than C2.
	
	
	In this way, the Crown would have the benefit of cross-admissibility of the evidence as between C1 and C2.
	
	
	I express my satisfaction that the requirements of ss.97(1)(b) and 101 have been met to permit a tendency direction along these lines. I note that Mr Bouveng did not oppose such a direction, which would involve modification of the Crown draft direction (MFI108).
	
	
	The tendency direction sought by the Crown for A2 (MFI109), involves a similar approach based upon cross-admissibility of the evidence between each of the complainants. The Crown relies upon the factors identified concerning the suggested tendency on the part of KM (set out at [11] above), with appropriate modifications for A2, such as a suggested tendency to engage in FGM against her biological prepubescent female children and to speak to the children about such activities, prior to this occurring.
	
	
	For the purposes of ss. 97(1)(b) and 101, I am satisfied that a modified version of MFI109 should be used for a tendency direction to the jury with respect to A2. It will be along similar lines to that which I have foreshadowed with respect to KM.
	
	
	I note that Senior Counsel for A2 did not resist an appropriately worded direction along these lines.
	


The Coincidence Issue


	
	I turn to the Crown application for a coincidence direction against KM and A2 (MFIs110 and 111).
	
	
	The Crown seeks such directions by way of a comparison between the events concerning C1 and C2, accompanied by a submission that there is a particular and peculiar pattern of behaviour such that it is highly improbable that each girl could be giving her account by sheer chance or coincidence. The Crown pointed to similarities along the lines relied upon on the application for tendency directions (see [11] and [21] above).
	
	
	Counsel for the Accused persons have opposed the giving of a coincidence direction. It was submitted that it was unnecessary and would not, in fact, add anything to the tendency direction which I propose to give.
	
	
	I bear in mind that a s.98 direction concerns the question of whether it is “improbable that the [two] events occurred coincidentally”. In the context of this case, there is no dispute that two general events occurred, involving the relevant participants at the times and places charged. What is in dispute is the precise nature of the event in the form of the procedure carried out on each child, in circumstances which were otherwise very similar.
	
	
	It is important to keep in mind that s.98 is a provision concerning the drawing of inferences. The statement of Simpson J (McClellan CJ at CL and Fullerton J agreeing) in R v Gale; R v Duckworth at 494 [25] is pertinent. Her Honour said:
	


“At its heart, s 98 is a provision concerning the drawing of inferences. The purpose sought to be achieved by the tender of coincidence evidence is to provide the foundation upon which the tribunal of fact could draw an inference. The inference is that a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind. The process of reasoning from which that inference would be drawn is:

*   two or more events occurred; and 

*   there were similarities in those events; or there were similarities in the circumstances in which those events occurred; or there were similarities in both the events and the circumstances in which they occurred; and

*   having regard to those similarities, it is improbable that the two events occurred coincidentally;

*   therefore the person in question did a particular act or had a particular state of mind.”


	
	It is also important to recognise that this process of reasoning and the drawing of inferences (in this case that the person did the act) is for the tribunal of fact, the jury: R v Gale; R v Duckworth at 494 [26].
	
	
	It is necessary to keep in mind, and to apply, the steps referred to by Simpson J in R v Gale; R v Duckworth at 495-496 [31]. I have done so in this case.
	
	
	It is the case that the great bulk of the similarities, in the events concerning C1 and C2, are not in contest. It is the final and critical step or event concerning what was done physically to each child which is in contest.
	
	
	It is necessary to return to the purpose of coincidence evidence - to permit the jury to undertake an inferential process leading to the question: Is it improbable that the two events occurred coincidentally?
	
	
	I keep in mind two features at this point:
	



	
	if a coincidence direction is given, it will allow the jury to consider similarities and dissimilarities, including that part of each child's account which supports the Crown case that a cut or nick to the clitoris or genital area occurred - the process is not confined to undisputed similarities;
	
	
	it is not necessary to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt concerning the allegations about one child or the other before this process is undertaken - it will be a matter for the jury, as the tribunal of fact, to determine what inferences should be drawn concerning the acts alleged to have been carried out by KM and A2.
	



	
	For the purpose of this ruling, I observe that the accounts of each of C1 and C2 support the Crown case that more was done than some symbolic touching of the genital area. Each account includes the infliction of hurt to the child, with references being made to cutting as well.
	
	
	It would be open to the jury to consider the similarities and dissimilarities for the purpose of drawing inferences as to what actually was done to each child on each occasion. The contested event in question is the alleged performance of FGM. It would be open to the jury to consider whether the two events occurred coincidentally in this case as part of a benign, symbolic ceremony, or, as the Crown asserts, as part of a circumcision procedure causing a cut or nick to the clitoris, or at least, the genital area.
	
	
	The evidence would also bear upon the question whether each girl has given credible and reliable evidence concerning what happened to each of them.
	
	
	In my view, the evidence is such as would permit the jury, acting reasonably, to reach the conclusion (advanced by the Crown) or to draw that inference so that the evidence has significant probative value: R v Gale; R v Duckworth at 495 [27]. I am satisfied, for the purpose of s.101, that the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the Accused persons.
	
	
	This is a case where there is an overlap between the tendency and coincidence rules, of the type which I referred to earlier (at [9]) which arises in particular, where there is no dispute as to the identity of the alleged offender, but what is in issue is whether the offences occurred.
	
	
	I propose to give coincidence directions to the jury concerning KM and A2. The directions will be in the form of a modified version of MFIs110 and 111.

2242059,Clark v R (No 2) [2015] NSWCCA 271,"Judgment


	
	THE COURT: This is an application made on 13 October 2015 pursuant to r 50C of the Criminal Appeal Rules to set aside a judgment by the Court (Beazley P, Hall and Button JJ) of 6 October 2015: Clark v R [2015] NSWCCA 265. It is, in fact, an application to set aside a judgment refusing an application to set aside a judgment which refused an application to set aside a judgment.
	
	
	Whilst the previous applications were wide-ranging, the present application is solely concerned with the applicant’s conviction in respect of an offence of aggravated sexual intercourse with child between 14-16: s 66C(4) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). It was one of 23 convictions recorded after a trial before Norrish QC DCJ in 2009. The other convictions were for offences in the nature of child sexual assault, child pornography and perverting the course of justice. There were six victims of the applicant’s offences.
	
	
	Mr Clark was sentenced to an overall term of imprisonment for 14 years 5 months with a non-parole period of 10 years 9 months. For the offence in question he received a sentence of 4 years 6 months that was entirely or partially concurrent with other individual sentences. The practical reality is that if Mr Clark was not convicted in respect of this offence, the overall sentence would have been no different.
	
	
	In 11 pages of written submissions in support of the present application Mr Clark seeks to advance issues that were decided adversely to him in his appeal against conviction (PFC v R [2011] NSWCCA 275); in an application under r 50C to set aside that judgment (PFC v R (No 2) [2014] NSWCCA 241); and in an application under r 50C to set aside the refusal of his first r 50C application (Clark v R [2015] NSWCCA 265).
	
	
	There is no reason to doubt the correctness of any of the previous judgments. Having regard to the extensive reasoning previously provided by the Court we do not consider it appropriate to once again engage with the issues. In short, the application is simply vexatious.
	


Order


	
	The application is dismissed.

		16 October 2015",2015-10-15 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2242060,Elshani v R [2015] NSWCCA 254,"Judgment


	
	GLEESON JA: I agree with Adams J, for the reasons that he gives, that the sentencing judge erred in sentencing the applicant in accordance with the State legislation, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), rather than the Commonwealth legislation, Part IB of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). Accordingly this Court must exercise the sentencing discretion afresh in accordance with the provisions of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW): Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601 at [42].
	
	
	The Court had before it additional material on resentencing (which was not before the sentencing judge) concerning the effect of the applicant's incarceration on his family. That material, which is summarised in the reasons of Adams J, concerns the psychological injury suffered by the applicant's wife and each of his children as a result of his incarceration.
	
	
	The Court is required under s 16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act to take into account the “probable effect” upon an offender's family or dependants of any sentence under consideration. Authority in this Court requires that this particular consideration must be read consistently with common law principles of sentencing. Accordingly it is necessary for the applicant to show exceptional hardship to a family member or dependant to ameliorate an otherwise appropriate sentence: R v Togias [2001] NSWCCA 522; 127 A Crim R 23 at [13]-[17] (Spigelman CJ); R v Hinton [2002] NSWCCA 405; 134 A Crim 286 at [31] (Howie J); and R v Zerafa [2013] NSWCCA 222; 235 A Crim R 265 at [93] (Hoeben CJ at CL; Latham J agreeing).
	
	
	The premise of this approach is that s 16A accommodates the application of the common law principle of sentencing referred to in the preceding paragraph because that principle gives relevant content to some of the expressions used in s 16A(2): Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [25]; Bui v Director of Public Prosecutions for the Commonwealth of Australia [2012] HCA 1; 244 CLR 638 at [18]-[19]. Whether that premise is correct in respect of subs (2)(p), has been challenged in the dissenting judgment of Beech-Jones J in Zerafa. Nonetheless, the approach of the majority in Zerafa and the line of authority on which it is based, has been consistently followed in this court, most recently in R v Lin [2014] NSWCCA 254 at [71]; and Huynh v R [2015] NSWCCA 167 at [34].
	
	
	The “exceptional hardship” approach to s 16A(2)(p) has also been applied by intermediate appellate courts in Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland but not in the Australian Capital Territory: see R v Matthews (1996) 130 FLR 230 at 233; Markovic v The Queen [2010] VSCA 105; 200 A Crim R 510; R v Berlinsky [2005] SASC 316; R v Sinclair (1990) 51 A Crim R 418 at 430-431; Nguyen v The Queen [2001] WASCA 119; 160 FLR 284 at [39] (Malcolm CJ), [66] (Wallwork J); S v The Queen [2003] WASCA 309 at [29] (Miller J, Mckechnie J agreeing) cf Wallwork AJ dissenting at [39]; R v Huston; Ex parte Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2011] QCA 350; 219 A Crim R 209; R v Ajelara [2015] QCA 56; cf Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Ip [2005] ACTCA 24 at [60].
	
	
	I am satisfied, for the reasons that Adams J gives, that the material presented on resentence demonstrates that the probable effect of the applicant's incarceration upon his family will give rise to exceptional hardship: s 16A(2)(p) Crimes Act.
	
	
	In these circumstances, it is unnecessary to address the applicant's contention that the decision of the majority in R v Zerafa and the other decisions of this Court and other intermediate appellate courts that have applied the “exceptional hardship” approach to s 16A(2)(p) were wrongly decided. That contention would require the Court to be “convinced” that the interpretation of s 16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act in those decisions is “plainly wrong”: Australian Securities Commission v Marlborough Gold Mines Ltd [1993] HCA 15; 177 CLR 485 at 492; Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 22; 230 CLR 89 at [135]. No good reason has been shown why the Court should undertake that task in circumstances where it is unnecessary to do so.
	
	
	I agree with Adams J and Beech-Jones J, for the reasons that they each give, that a head sentence of 6 years is appropriate. I consider that a non-parole period of 3 years 3 months is appropriate for the reasons given by Beech-Jones J at [43]. I agree with the orders proposed by Adams J.
	
	
	ADAMS J: On 15 May 2013 the applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to the offence of trafficking a marketable quantity of heroin between 30 October and 2 November 2011 in Sydney, an offence under s 302.3 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). The maximum penalty for this offence is 25 years imprisonment. A marketable quantity of heroin is between 250g and 1.5kg, the amount in the possession of the applicant being 1.053kg. He was convicted in the District Court on his plea and sentenced on 14 October 2013 to an overall sentence of 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years commencing 1 November 2012. A discount of 25 per cent was allowed for his early plea.
	


Amended grounds of appeal


	
	Leave was granted permitting the applicant to amend his grounds of appeal. The Crown did not oppose this course. The grounds are as follows –
	


“Ground 1: Her Honour erred in failing to consider the impact of the custodial sentence upon the applicant’s family when determining a sentence of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the case.

Ground 2: Her Honour erred when finding special circumstances by applying principles associated with the sentencing of offenders for offences against NSW laws.

Ground 3: Her Honour failed to sentence the applicant in accordance with Part 1B of the Crimes Act 1914.”

The facts


	
	Agreed facts were tendered. The following summary is taken from the learned primary judge’s reasons. Late in October 2012 the applicant contacted a Mr Ng in Singapore to arrange for the collection of prohibited imports for which the applicant had been awaiting delivery in Australia for a number of weeks. It was ultimately arranged that they would be delivered on 31 October. On that day, a Mr Goh arrived in Sydney and took instructions from contacts in Malaysia about making contact with a person in Sydney. At about the same time the applicant spoke to his Singapore contact and then a Malaysian contact, which ultimately resulted in he and Mr Goh contacting each other. After a number of communications between Mr Goh and his Malaysian contacts, the drugs were delivered to him. The applicant was told by Mr Ng that the transaction was ready to be completed and he travelled from Queensland to Sydney on 1 November to receive the drugs. Later that night, the applicant met with Mr Goh and obtained 1.497kg of heroin (net weight 1.053kg) and handed over about $10,000, although this amount was only part payment and perhaps as much as $300,000 was outstanding. There was no evidence as to how this balance was to be dealt with. The applicant was arrested in a car with the heroin in his possession at about 10.00pm that night, shortly after the exchange. Mr Goh was arrested in his hotel in Coogee whilst one of his associates was also arrested at a hotel in Kensington.
	
	
	The primary judge inferred that Mr Goh handed the drugs to the applicant on the assumption that the latter was to distribute the drugs further in Australia and that further payment would be made at some time in the future. She noted that there was no evidence as to whether the applicant was to personally profit from an arranged on-sale or whether he was to arrange the wholesale of the package. As it happened, Mr Goh was in possession of a further 1.5kg of the drug when he was arrested and her Honour thought it a fair assumption that he was going to distribute this quantity himself. The large number of communications involving Singapore and Malaysian connections showed that the transaction was a result of considerable organisation but there was no evidence that Mr Goh or the applicant either knew each other or were involved in the arrangements that led to the ultimate delivery of the drugs to Mr Goh. The applicant and Mr Goh were more than couriers, but no evidence justified a finding of greater involvement. Mr Goh’s evidence in the proceedings was that he expected to receive about $25,000 for his part in the offence but, as I have mentioned, there was no evidence as to how much the applicant was to receive. Her Honour, not surprisingly, inferred that the applicant expected to obtain the quantity of drugs he received and was going to arrange payment for it or on sell it.
	
	
	Both the applicant and Mr Goh played important parts in the offence of trafficking heroin into Australia but their roles appear to have been organised by others. No inference could be drawn, in particular, that the applicant was to be the principal distributor of the drugs in Australia. Because of the greater quantity with which Mr Goh was concerned, a total of 2.285kg of pure heroin, he was guilty of having trafficked a commercial quantity and liable to a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
	


Subjective features


	
	The applicant did not give evidence. Some documents were tendered on his behalf to the effect he was undertaking some courses and working in prison. There were testimonials from friends who had known the applicant for some years, referring to his strong feelings for his family and expressing surprise about his involvement in the crime. The applicant also wrote a letter addressed to the judge expressing his embarrassment and shame and a promise of reformation, acknowledging also that he had let down his family, especially his children, as well as his friends. There was also evidence that he had been generous with his time and resources towards fellow Albanians in Kosovo who had been affected badly by the civil war in the 1990s.
	
	
	A report from Mr Watson-Munro, a psychologist, was also tendered without objection. It is fairly summed up in the written submissions of Mr Game SC, appearing for the applicant on the appeal, as concluding that the applicant was stressed and troubled by his isolation from his family and suffered from depression; he was not a drug user; and although his marriage was over, his family were very supportive. He did not suffer from a mental illness but was depressed and anxious and needed medication and cognitive behaviour therapies. He was very remorseful. The primary judge referred briefly to this report, noting that the background to which it referred did not appear to be disputed. Her Honour referred to the applicant’s difficult life circumstances resulting from the conflict in Kosovo. Although these did not have anything to do with the commission of the offence, her Honour apparently accepted they had led to his being depressed and he was “understandably anxious”. Her Honour noted that the applicant would serve his sentence away from his family, who mostly resided in Queensland, and that this would cause “some difficulties for him”. Her Honour referred to the testimonials which had been tendered and concluded –
	


“[The applicant] comes to this Court as a person of prior good character and the only blemish on his criminal record relate to some convictions which are irrelevant for the circumstances of this sentence. His wife and his daughter have both written letters to the Court indicating they fully support him, as have other people who indicate that in general he is a very hard worker who they believe would not normally involve himself in this sort of offence.”

Her Honour accepted that the applicant’s acknowledgement of the loss that the commission of the offence would cause to his family and to his community was sincere.


	
	Of significance, given the second and third grounds of appeal, was the way in which her Honour calculated the non-parole period. I set out the relevant passage in full –
	


“I accept, therefore, that both offenders are entitled to a finding of special circumstances to some extent because both of them, separately and in different forms, will suffer isolation in custody. Mr Goh because of his language and cultural isolation and Mr Elshani because of his family isolation and his general mental health issues. Mr Elshani, I find, has good prospects of rehabilitation based mainly on his strong family support and good character in the past. I do, however, find that he will need substantial supervision on his release into the community because of his involvement in this offence.” [Emphasis added.]

Submissions


	
	Mr Game SC, for the applicant, pointed out that the applicant stood to be sentenced for an offence committed against the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). Pt IB of the Act deals with the sentencing, imprisonment and release of a federal offender and Div 4 deals with the fixing of non-parole periods and the making of recognizance release orders. The notion of “special circumstances” is immaterial although it is undoubtedly of particular importance in setting non-parole periods under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) applicable to NSW offences, s 44(2) of which provides –
	


“44 Court to set non-parole period

(1) …

(2) The balance of the term of the sentence must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period for the sentence, unless the court decides that there are special circumstances for it being more (in which case the court must make a record of its reasons for that decision).”


	
	Nothing in the Commonwealth legislation mirrors or reflects this provision. The setting of a non-parole period is entirely within the discretion the Court, calculated of course by reference to the conventional and applicable sentencing principles. It is now not controversial that there is no “normal” non-parole period for federal offences determined by a percentage of the head sentence: Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520. In dealing with what the Court described as a “fundamental starting point”, it said (at [21]) –
	


“Of their own force the laws of the States with respect to the sentencing of offenders could have no operation with respect to the sentencing of offenders against laws of the Commonwealth (Bass v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd (1999) 198 CLR 334 at 352 [35]; [1999] HCA 9; Solomons v District Court (NSW) (2002) 211 CLR 119 at 134 [21]; [2002] HCA 47). Any relevant operation is by reason of a federal law which ‘picks up’ State law. By operation of s 68 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) (‘the Judiciary Act’), some State and Territory laws in relation to the sentencing of offenders are picked up and applied when a court, exercising federal jurisdiction conferred by s 68, sentences a federal offender (Putland v The Queen (2004) 218 CLR 174; [2004] HCA 8). But, to the extent to which Pt IB of the Crimes Act otherwise provides, State and Territory laws in relation to the sentencing of offenders are not picked up …”


	
	It was submitted by Mr Game SC, firstly, that the reference to special circumstances indicated that the primary judge was mistakenly applying the procedure for assessing and setting a non-parole period under the NSW Act. This submission was reinforced by her Honour sentencing the applicant by referring firstly to the non-parole period of 4 years and then to the “balance of 2 years”, language which echoes that used in s 44 of the NSW Act. No such process is either mandated or proposed in s 19AB of the Commonwealth legislation, which simply provides (in s 19AB(1)) that, where a person is convicted of a federal offence and a life sentence or a sentence exceeding 3 years is imposed, the Court must either fix a non-parole period or, in the circumstances specified, make a recognizance release order. Thus, the sentence is first imposed and then a non-parole period set. Further precision is unnecessary for present purposes. The NSW Act prescribes a calculus which provides that, unless special circumstances are present, the specified ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of the term would be applied. In short, there must be material that justifies a variation of what might be referred to fairly as the default position which otherwise is to apply. This approach is very different to that for which the Commonwealth legislation provides: there is no default proportion which must be considered, let alone applied unless there are reasons amounting to special circumstances justifying departure.
	
	
	Furthermore, the judge, in setting the sentence, clearly stated the expiry date of the non-parole period but gave no further information about the nature of the sentence, thus omitting to give the information required by s 16F(1) of the Commonwealth Act, which provides as follows –
	


“Court to explain sentence 

(1) Where a court imposes a federal sentence on a person and fixes a non-parole period in respect of the sentence, it must explain or cause to be explained to the person, in language likely to be readily understood by the person, the purpose and consequences of fixing that non-parole period including, in particular, an explanation:

(a) that service of the sentence will entail a period of imprisonment of not less than the non-parole period and, if a parole order is made, a period of service in the community, called the parole period, to complete service of the sentence; and

(b) that, if a parole order is made, the order will be subject to conditions; and

(c) that the parole order may be amended or revoked; and

(d) of the consequences that may follow if the person fails, without reasonable excuse, to fulfil those conditions.”

This tends to confirm that the primary judge had in her mind the State rather than the Commonwealth regime when sentencing the applicant.


	
	The Crown prosecutor in this Court pointed out, rightly, that if there was an error made by the primary judge, it did not result from any of the submissions made either by the defence or by the Crown. Indeed, the latter pointed out, in particular, that there was no assumed starting point for the ratio of the period to be served as a proportion of the head sentence, citing Hili & Jones in this respect. It was submitted that the matters referred to by the primary judge in setting the non-parole period were relevant for that purpose and that the ultimate proportion reflected the submission of Mr Boulten SC for the applicant that “the normal pattern on non-parole periods of about 60 to 66% of the total sentence would be appropriate”. It was submitted in this Court by the prosecutor, in short, that the primary judge’s reference to special circumstances was inconsequential.
	


Consideration


	
	The sentence proceedings took place on 11 October 2013, a weekend intervened and the applicant was sentenced on 14 October 2013. Although it may be that her Honour’s reasons were not quite ex tempore, I think it is appropriate to consider them in light of the pressures of work in the District Court which requires matters to be quickly dispatched. Her Honour’s reasons are therefore not to be approached in a closely analytical way and there must be due recognition for the risk, to which we are all subject, of a slip of language or awkwardness of expression which does not correctly reflect the notion sought to be expressed. However, making every allowance, I do not consider that her Honour made this kind of mistake. The consistent working through the State regime demonstrates, in my respectful view, that, indeed, her Honour mistakenly applied the State rather than the Commonwealth legislation. This is significant because of the different character of the discretion concerning the setting of the non-parole period. It follows that the second and third grounds of appeal are made out. It is not therefore necessary to consider the first ground of appeal although the material upon which it depends is necessary to the task of resentencing the applicant in accordance with the provisions of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). To that matter I now turn.
	


The applicant’s family circumstances


	
	Evidence of the applicant’s family circumstances has been placed before the Court. At first instance, the impact of the applicant’s incarceration on his family came from a letter from his wife, which was tendered without objection. In this Court, the applicant read without objection the affidavit of Mr Ricci, his solicitor, which annexes reports by Ms Johnstone, a forensic psychologist in respect of the applicant’s de facto spouse, his elder daughter (19 years of age), his elder son (17 years), younger daughter (16 years) and younger son (aged 15 years). In addition, reports were annexed from Ms Atkinson, the applicant’s wife’s treating psychologist and Ms Fornasier, that of the applicant’s elder daughter. This material is far more informative than that which was before the primary judge. Ms Johnstone’s reports contain detailed histories, results of psychometric testing, clinical observations and recommendations. It is not necessary for present purposes to set out all this information in detail and privacy considerations make it undesirable to do so. (The summaries omit quotation marks for ease of reading.)
	
	
	As a provisional diagnostic impression, the applicant’s spouse meets the criteria for a DSM-V diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder With Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood. Her symptoms are clinically significant, evidenced by impairments in social and other important areas of functioning. The stress-related disturbance is not another mental disorder and is not merely an exacerbation of a pre-existing mental disorder. The symptoms do not represent normal bereavement. Overall, the onset of her adjustment difficulties appear to have occurred immediately in the aftermath of the applicant’s incarceration and she displays a pattern of protracted distress and psychological difficulties. She needs continuing medical and psychological help. The report of Ms Atkinson essentially agrees with that of Ms Johnstone, although my impression is that the difficulties seen by Ms Atkinson are somewhat less psychologically damaging than Ms Johnstone’s assessment suggests.
	
	
	So far as the applicant’s elder daughter is concerned, Ms Johnstone describes serious emotional dysfunction, including suicidal ideation, following her father’s arrest and incarceration, one of the consequences of which was she felt unable to take up a university opportunity. She has had panic attacks and developed other significant responses to her stress, not only unhealthy in a physical sense but also in her social connections. She has displayed a high degree of worry and anxiety over her family as a whole, particularly about the welfare of her younger sister and over the family’s financial situation. Psychometric assessment confirmed significant problems suggesting an individual who is experiencing severe levels of depression and anxiety, generally appears to be overwhelmed by emotional lability and negative thoughts and has developed a degree of detachment as a form of coping with other unhealthy psychological traits. Ms Johnstone’s provisional diagnostic impression is that she met the criteria for the DSM-V diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, Single, Moderate, With Anxious Distress (Moderate) and Panic Disorder (provisional). She had some pre-existing vulnerabilities but, since her father’s incarceration, she has experienced a number of significant psychological and adjustment difficulties, which are most evident in her schooling and the development of depressive and anxious symptoms. She displays a pattern of protracted distress and needs further referral for psychological and/or psychiatric services, which may include consideration of antidepressant medication. Ms Fornasier reported that, when treatment commenced, she suffered from extremely severe depression, anxiety and stress. After intervention, her depression reduced to moderate, but her anxiety remained extremely severe and her stress remained severe. There was some progress over the course of treatment and it is reasonable to expect that she would benefit from more assistance.
	
	
	Ms Johnstone reports that, following his father going into gaol when he was in year 11, the applicant’s elder son’s school performance suffered, he gained weight and became more isolated. However, he is now enrolled at university doing a full time degree and reports no significant worries or concerns so far as undertaking his studies is concerned. Out of university he reported what appears to be a somewhat isolated social life generally. He reported experiencing heightened levels of stress and more labile emotions and mood with suicidal ideation, though this is “much less now” that school is finished. Her provisional diagnostic impression is that he currently meets criteria for the DSM-V diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder. (He had previously been diagnosed with Asperger’s disorder which is no longer separately recognised and falls within the definition of Autism Spectrum Disorder.) Overall, he displayed a relatively “standard” pattern of behaviour associated with the separation from his father, displaying a pattern of initial distress which appears to have declined over time. He struggled to manage negative emotional states overall but has managed to cope with very serious emotional difficulties caused by his father’s incarceration. Ms Johnstone did not consider that he required any additional supports or services.
	
	
	The younger daughter experienced considerable emotional upset at the time of her father’s incarceration and has ongoing concerns as to how her family, especially her mother, is coping with the separation. Ms Johnstone’s provisional impression was that she meets the criteria for the DSM-V diagnosis of Anorexia, Severe (provisional). She is medically considered to be severely underweight and warrants referral for further assessment and intervention. Some compensatory mechanisms have worked at a superficial level but these processes, while effective in the short term, can be conceptualised as a “ticking time bomb”, in which a point of exhaustion is reached when the individual cannot sustain their level of functioning without appropriate support and adaptive coping. She needs regular engagement with a general practitioner since, in the absence of treatment her prognosis is guarded and her health and general wellbeing may deteriorate. With appropriate treatment, her prognosis would be more positive.
	
	
	The youngest child reports a history of troubling interactions at school. He self-harmed for a brief time after his father’s incarceration and has recurrent suicidal ideation, most recently in about August 2014 when he felt overwhelmed and depressed. He reports symptoms associated with depression (compounded by the serious problems at school) and an increased level of hyper vigilance. He meets the criteria for the DSM-V diagnosis of Unspecified Trauma–and–Stressor Related Disorder (Provisional) and Panic Disorder (Provisional). In short, this young boy presented with a number of symptoms that are causing him clinically significant adjustment difficulties and distress. He would likely benefit from further assessment and ongoing management of his current psychopathology.
	
	
	This evidence indicates that, although in some respects the applicant’s children have learnt to cope to a significant degree with the applicant’s incarceration, they suffer from significant adverse psychological consequences. To my mind, these are substantially greater than those ordinarily to be associated with separations of this kind.
	


Can the problems of the applicant’s family be taken into account?


	
	Of course, there is no bright line and the significance of this in the sentencing context is necessarily a matter of fact and degree. However, it seems fair to say that the consequences for the applicant’s family of his incarceration appear to be relevant under s 16A(2) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) which requires that “the court must take into account … (p) the probable effect that any sentence or order under consideration would have on any of the person’s family or dependants”. However, this paragraph has not been applied in accordance with what would seem to be its plain language. In R v Zerafa [2013] NSWCCA 222; 235 A Crim R 265 this Court considered a line of authority commencing with R v Togias [2001] NSWCCA 522; 127 A Crim R 23 and R v Hinton [2002] NSWCCA 405; 134 A Crim 286, which has been followed in Victoria and Queensland and to some extent in South Australia and Western Australia (but not in the Australian Capital Territory) to the effect that the common law rule that only exceptional hardship to an offender’s family can be taken into account applies also to s 16A(2)(p). Following a review of the authorities both here and in the other States to which I have referred, Hoeben CJ at CL (with whom Latham J agreed) concluded (at [93]) that it was not appropriate for this Court to overrule or depart from the principle stated in Togias and Hinton in respect of the application of s 16A(2)(p) and that, if there were to be a change in the position, as the Chief Justice said in Togias (at [17]), “only the High Court can effect it”. Beech-Jones J, for his part, dissented on the introduction of the requirement of exceptional circumstances before s 16A(2)(p) could be relevant. Following a detailed discussion of authorities both in this State and elsewhere, his Honour noted –
	


“[139] … As best as I can ascertain, none of the judgments that have adopted or applied this principle has attempted to reconcile it with the express words of the section or considered the secondary materials concerning its introduction. In my view those matters invalidate the assumption upon which this stream of cases has flowed, namely that the section was not intended to modify the common law's treatment of hardship to an offender's family.

[140] This succession of cases has led to the adoption of a principle with little to commend it. If in other contexts Courts are bound to consider the impact of their orders on innocent third parties (Patrick Stevedores Operations No 2 Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia (No 3) [1998] HCA 30; 195 CLR 1 at [65] to [66]; Silktone Pty Ltd v Devreal Capital Pty Ltd (1990) 21 NSWLR 317 at 324 and 332), why is the impact on children of any sentence under consideration to be excluded unless their hardship is only exceptional? The primary objects in sentencing of ""retribution, deterrence [and the] protection of society"" described by Wells J in Wirth can still be given effect to without requiring sentencing courts to divide the forms of hardship occasioned to an offender's family into those which meet the description ""exceptional"" and those which do not. The assessment of probable hardship to family members is a task that sentencing courts are perfectly able to undertake, and no doubt they do. In any event, the words of the section and the secondary materials indicate a clear policy choice on the part of the legislature on this topic.

[141] Further, the difficulty that accompanies the addition of a gloss to a legislative provision that is otherwise clear is revealed by the different formulations of the gloss that have emerged from the cases. The construction adopted by Howie J in Hinton suggests that no consideration can be given to hardship that falls short of the description ""exceptional"". The judgment of Spigelman CJ in Togias suggests that something other than ""substantial weight"" might be afforded to probable hardship occasioned to family members of offenders even if exceptional circumstances cannot be demonstrated. [R v] Nguyen [2006] NSWCCA 369 appears to confirm that. In circumstances where s 16A(2) specifies that a court is to take a ""matter into account"", what authority does an intermediate court of appeal have to specify the weight a sentencing court attaches to that factor? The relevant constraint on a sentencing court affording too much weight to the factor set out in s 16A(2)(p) is to be found in s 16A(1). Unconstrained by authority, in my view, s 16A(2)(p) should be applied by sentencing courts according to its terms, without having to determine whether the circumstances are exceptional or otherwise. If the result of affording weight to that consideration is that the sentence is unduly lenient then that will attract appellate interference on the established basis that it is manifestly inadequate, but not because some specified level of weight was attached to this factor that the Crimes Act does not expressly preclude. A sentence that is manifestly inadequate does not conform with s 16A(1).”


	
	His Honour concluded (at [144]) that “the construction of s 16A(2)(p) which reads the provision as though it was preceded or proceeded by the words ‘in an exceptional case’ is plainly wrong” and should not be followed.
	
	
	I should mention that it was put as a secondary argument by counsel on behalf of Zerafa (and by Mr Game SC here) that some weight at least could be given to the probable hardship to the respondent’s family as found by the primary judge as part of the mix of subjective circumstances, relying on R v Nguyen [2006] NSWCCA 369. The possibility of this approach was mentioned by Hodgson JA (Levine and Howie JJ agreeing) in R v Girard [2004] NSWCCA 170 where his Honour said –
	


“[22] I would adopt the remarks of this court in R v X [2004] NSWCCA 93 at [24] in the following terms:

I have already acknowledged the exigent nature of the respondent's family circumstances. To have regard to those circumstances as part of the general mix of subjective matters is one thing. It is, however, an entirely different thing to isolate those family circumstances, characterise them as highly exceptional, and use that characterisation as a justification for a discrete and substantial measure of leniency added onto the respondent's entitlements under the general law and under the general requirements of sections 22 and 23 of the Sentencing Procedure Act.”


	
	In Nguyen, James J (Hidden and Hislop JJ agreeing) agreed with this approach. The majority in Zerafa, upholding the Crown appeal as to inadequacy, did not find it necessary to consider it. Hoeben CJ at CL said –
	


“[97] … I am not satisfied on my reading of this material that even if those parts which related to the effect of the respondent's incarceration on his family were taken into account on sentencing, it would significantly affect the outcome. As her Honour concluded, those circumstances do not amount to ""exceptional"" hardship. Except for the nervous symptoms likely to be experienced by the respondent's son, it is the sort of reaction that one would expect from most close families if a father received a prison sentence. Accordingly, even if as the respondent urged upon the Court, hardship to third parties was taken into account in the sentencing process, it would not operate to significantly mitigate the sentence which should be imposed.”


	
	As the prosecutor in this Court pointed out, Zerafa has been followed in R v Qian Lin [2014] NSWCCA 254; MLP v R [2014] NSWCCA 183; Khoo v R [2013] NSWCCA 323; Huynh v R [2015] NSWCCA 167 and, in Queensland, in R v Ajelara [2015] QCA 56.
	
	
	In my respectful view, despite the persuasive (indeed convincing) dissenting judgment of Beech-Jones J in Zerafa, the principle stated by the majority has now become too embedded for this Court to reconsider it.
	
	
	At all events, I have concluded that the psychological injury suffered (in various ways and to a greater or lesser extent) by each member of the applicant’s family as a result of his incarceration is indeed exceptional within the meaning of that term at common law and thus is to be taken into account under s 16A(2)(p). It is substantially greater than the ordinary or expected sadness, anxiety or disappointment that would normally follow a separation of the present kind. Furthermore, that each member of the family is adversely affected reduces the ordinary support usually provided by members of the family to each other. It follows that real significance should be accorded this factor when weighing the applicant’s subjective circumstances.
	
	
	The applicant has also placed before the Court additional material relating to his conduct whilst in prison, indicating that he is participating in a number of useful education programs and is currently on TAFE release having enrolled in a certificate course involving training in various work skills. He has worked within the gaol and holds a trusted position with minimal supervision. I have noted already the report of Mr Watson-Munro to the effect that the applicant has a long standing depressive illness together with an anxiety disorder associated with developing agoraphobia for which treatment is necessary. This gives particular point to his knowledge of the significant problems caused by his incarceration for his family, which adds a degree of harshness to his sentence. Despite this condition he has been able to function apparently well in the prison environment.
	


Assessment


	
	Mr Game SC did not submit that the overall sentence of 6 years was inappropriate, rather focusing his attention on the non-parole period. It seems to me, at all events, that a sentence of 6 years imprisonment, having regard to both the objective and subjective features of this case, is appropriate. I agree with Gleeson JA and Beech-Jones J that a non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months should be imposed. Accordingly, I propose the following orders –
	



	
	Leave to appeal is granted.
	
	
	The non-parole period is quashed and, in lieu thereof, a non-parole period is imposed of 3 years and 3 months commencing on 1 November 2012 and ending on 31 January 2016.
	
	
	In accordance with s 16F of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) the appellant’s solicitor is directed to explain to the appellant, in language likely to be readily understood by him, the purpose and consequences of fixing the non-parole period including, in particular, an explanation:
	



	
	that service of the sentence will entail a period of imprisonment of not less than the non-parole period and, if a parole order is made, a period of service in the community, called the parole period, to complete service of the sentence; and
	
	
	that, if a parole order is made, the order will be subject to conditions; and
	
	
	that the parole order may be amended or revoked; and
	
	
	of the consequences that may follow if the person fails, without reasonable excuse, to fulfil those conditions.
	



	
	BEECH-JONES J: I have read the judgment of Adams J. I agree with Adams J that the sentencing judge erred in sentencing the applicant in accordance with the statutory regime provided for in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) rather than in accordance with Part IB of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). This error warrants this Court re-exercising the sentencing discretion in its own right.
	
	
	One issue that arises on resentencing is the proper construction of s 16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act 1914 and, in particular, whether it is only family hardship that can be characterised as exceptional that can be taken into account in the course of determining a sentence that is “of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence” as referred to in s 16A(1). Senior Counsel for the applicant, Mr Game SC, submitted that decisions, including judgments of this Court, that adhere to that construction are clearly wrong and should not be followed (see Australian Securities Commission v Marlborough Gold Mines Ltd [1993] HCA 15; 177 CLR 485 at 492). I agree for the reasons I stated in R v Zerafa [2013] NSWCCA 222 at [111] to [149]; “Zerafa”). In my view “s 16A(2)(p) should be applied by sentencing courts according to its terms, without having to determine whether the circumstances are exceptional or otherwise” (Zerafa at [141]).
	
	
	As Adams J has pointed out at [34], since Zerafa a number of decisions of this Court as well as a decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal (R v Ajelara [2015] QCA 56) have reaffirmed the contrary view. However in those cases and all which preceded Zerafa there was no discussion of how the preferred interpretation of s 16A(2)(p) could be arrived at having regard to orthodox principles of statutory construction. The issue presented by the continued maintenance of this construction of s 16A(2)(p) is not the same as that which presents itself to a Court at this level of the judicial hierarchy that is determining whether it will depart from some well established doctrine of the common law. Instead the issue is whether such a Court will maintain an interpretation of a statutory provision which is contrary to Parliament’s clearly stated intention and which has been established by a line of authority that has not sought to justify it. In my view it should not be maintained. The line of authority is clearly wrong and should not be followed.
	
	
	The material concerning the applicant’s family is summarised in the judgment of Adams J. That material indicates that they have been experiencing significant hardship since his incarceration especially his youngest two children. The material does not give much insight into the role played by the applicant in his family prior to his arrest. Nevertheless there is sufficient material to conclude that his absence is exacerbating their unfortunate situation and placing great stress on the children’s mother. In my view the material presented on sentence is similar to the material in Zerafa that warranted the attribution of “real weight in the process of synthesising the various factors relevant to fixing an appropriate sentence” (Zerafa at [152]). In particular the material points to a reduction in the non-parole period that might otherwise be imposed so that the adverse affectation of the applicant’s children may be reduced while the community are afforded a measure of protection from his supervision while on parole (see Bugmy v The Queen [1990] HCA 18; 169 CLR 525).
	
	
	On resentencing there was no real dispute by either party as to the appropriateness of the head sentence of six years. However both that aspect of the sentence and the contentious aspect, namely the non-parole period, must be reconsidered by this Court in the fresh exercise of its discretion to resentence (Kentwell v R [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601). Having regard to the seriousness of the offence especially the quantity of heroin but also bearing in mind the limited findings as to the applicant’s level of involvement, his plea of guilty and his subjective case I consider that a six year head sentence is appropriate. In relation to the non-parole period there is no “judicially determined norm or starting point” (Hilli v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [44]). The sentencing judge found that the applicant had “good prospects of rehabilitation”. Bearing in mind that finding and the material concerning his family, I consider that a non-parole period of three years and three months is appropriate.
	
	
	I agree with the orders proposed by Adams J.

	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


Offences and sentence

On 12 November 2013 the applicant pleaded guilty in the Campbelltown Local Court to the following offences:


	
	One count of using a carriage service to access child pornography material between 1 October 2012 and 13 January 2013 contrary to s 474.19(1)(a)(i) of the Commonwealth Criminal Code;
	
	
	Four counts of possessing child abuse material contrary to s 91H(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW); AND
	
	
	One count of using a carriage service to access child pornography material between 1 March 2005 and 22 April 2008 contrary to s 474.19(1)(a)(i) of the Commonwealth Criminal Code.
	



	
	The maximum penalties for the Commonwealth child pornography offences were 10 years imprisonment for the offence committed before 15 April 2010 and 15 years imprisonment for the offence committed after 15 April 2010. The maximum penalty for each of the State child abuse offences was 10 years imprisonment.
	
	
	On 18 June 2014 the applicant was sentenced by Christie QC ADCJ as follows:
	



	
	In respect of the State possession offences, imprisonment for a period of 3 years and 9 months commencing 13 September 2014 and expiring 12 June 2018 with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months expiring 12 December 2016.
	
	
	In respect of the Commonwealth access offences, imprisonment for a period of 2 years and 3 months commencing 13 June 2014 and expiring 12 September 2016 and thereafter to enter a good behaviour bond for a period of 9 months pursuant to s 28(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).
	



	
	As can be seen, the non-parole components of the sentences were fully concurrent.
	


Factual Background


	
	The Australian Federal Police (AFP) were investigating child pornography material being shared or downloaded over the internet using “peer to peer” file sharing technology which is an internet network that allows a group of computer users with the same networking program to connect with each other and directly access files from one another’s hard drive. Programs entitled “eMule”, “eDonkey” and “BearShare” are such peer to peer file sharing programs. As part of that investigation, the AFP identified an internet protocol address which was the applicant’s address and which was being used to download child pornography videos and images.
	
	
	Upon executing a search warrant at the address on 13 March 2013, the AFP identified that the applicant and his mother were the only occupants of the premises. A number of computer hardware devices and numerous hard drive storage devices were located and seized. The seized items included a desktop computer which contained six internal hard drives, three external hard disc drives and four compact discs. A preliminary examination of these devices revealed the presence of child pornography material.
	
	
	During a recorded interview with the AFP, the applicant made a number of admissions including the following:
	



	
	Child pornography was located on the premises.
	
	
	He had downloaded and stored child pornography on his desktop computer.
	
	
	The desktop computer was password protected and he was the sole user of that device.
	
	
	He had downloaded child pornography using a peer to peer file sharing program called “eMule”.
	
	
	He was aware that child pornography was illegal.
	
	
	He was not sexually aroused when he viewed child pornography.
	
	
	He was curious and had viewed the child pornography stored on his computer and storage devices.
	
	
	He had been accessing child pornography material via the internet for the previous five to ten years.
	



	
	When the AFP subsequently examined the seized devices, they found child pornography and child abuse material stored on five of the internal hard drives located in the desktop computer, on two of the external hard disc drives and on three compact discs. In total 1,145 items, which have been classified as child abuse material, were found on the devices in the applicant’s possession. Those items were classified according to the Child Exploitation Tracking System (CETS) scale of objective seriousness into the following categories:
	



	
	A total of 353 images and videos were classified within Category 1, involving sexually suggestive posing with no sexual activity.
	
	
	A total of 85 images and videos were classified within Category 2, involving non-penetrative sexual activity between children or solo masturbation by a child.
	
	
	A total of 30 images and videos were classified within Category 3, involving non-penetrative sexual activity between adults and children.
	
	
	A total of 294 images and videos were classified within Category 4, involving penetrative sexual activity between adults and children.
	
	
	A total of 9 images and videos were classified within Category 5, involving children subjected to sadism, humiliation or bestiality; and
	
	
	A total of 374 images and videos were classified within Category 6, involving animated or virtual depictions of children engaged in sexual poses or activity.
	



	
	Out of the total number of items possessed, 390 were videos. Of those videos:
	



	
	18 were classified within Category 3.
	
	
	260 were classified within Category 4.
	
	
	9 were classified within Category 5.
	



	
	In relation to the use of the carriage service to access child pornography, subsequent examination of the seized desktop computer and its internal hard drives revealed that between 1 October 2012 and 13 January 2013 the internet had been used via the “eMule” peer to peer file sharing program to access and download 68 child pornography videos.
	
	
	Those 68 videos were classified into the following categories:
	



	
	3 videos were classified within Category 1.
	
	
	3 videos were classified within Category 2.
	
	
	60 videos were classified within Category 4.
	
	
	2 videos were classified within Category 5.
	



	
	Further examination of an external hard disc drive revealed that between 1 March 2005 and 22 April 2007, the internet had been used via the “BearShare” peer to peer file sharing program to access and download 18 pornography videos.
	
	
	Those 18 videos were classified into the following categories:
	



	
	2 videos were classified within Category 1.
	
	
	6 videos were classified within Category 2.
	
	
	3 videos were classified within Category 3.
	
	
	6 videos were classified within Category 4.
	
	
	1 videos were classified within Category 5.
	



	
	It was common ground that the total number of items in relation to the Commonwealth offences was 86 videos that ranged across the CETS spectrum.
	
	
	The totality of the material involved 700 – 800 child victims, being predominantly girls, ranging in age between 11 and 14 years. The video materials ranged in duration between seconds to three hours.
	


Proceedings on sentence


	
	His Honour did not see all of the material. He was provided with a representative sample, including videos, to get a general perception of the type of material which formed the basis of the offences. His Honour noted that the quantity of material was “very large”. When considering the objective seriousness of the offending, his Honour said:
	


“The objective seriousness of the offence is said to relate to the nature and content of the images, the number of images or items of material, whether the possession or importation is for the purpose of further distribution and whether the offender would profit from the offence. There is no suggestion here that this man disseminated the material to the planet at large, and indeed, do not - unless I have missed something - I do not think he disseminated it anywhere and there was certainly no profit in relation to the offence.

Approximately a quarter of the material involved penetrative sexual activity between children, or adults, or children and children and a further nine offences related to the depicting of sadism or bestiality.

The Crown concedes, of course, there was no evidence that the offender profited financially from his offending and also make the point that there was a significant number of offending materials and that places the offender's conduct in the highest end of offending. That is a proposition with which I agree.” (ROS 5.4)


	
	His Honour went on to recite some further submissions by the Crown, but it is not clear whether his Honour adopted those submissions in whole or in part:
	


“The submissions deal with a course of conduct consisting of serious criminal acts of the same or similar character, a course of conduct involved a

series of criminal acts, and the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity. The repeated use of this material lasted between approximately five to nine years in searching for images and maintaining his

possession of them.” (ROS 5.9 – 6.1)


	
	Later in the judgment, his Honour said:
	


“Of particular importance, I think, in those submissions, is a reference to a particular case in which there are some pointers as to the assessment of the objective seriousness of offences, whether actual children were used in the creation of the material, the nature and content of the material, including the age of the children, and the gravity of the sexual activity portrayed. Once I

saw some of these things, I think I am entitled to say that in some of them the gravity is far higher than others but in all of them, of course, the gravity is very significant.

The extent of any cruelty or physical harm occasioned to the children, and the number of images or items of material in possession, the significance being more in the number of different children depicted and those numbers of children are mentioned, of course, in the Crown's submissions.” (ROS 8.1)


	
	By way of mitigation, his Honour noted that the pornographic and child abuse material was for the applicant’s own use, not for sale or dissemination and that there was no profit motive when engaging in this criminal activity.
	
	
	In relation to the applicant’s subjective case, his Honour had regard to the following matters. At the time of sentence, the applicant was aged 36 and had no prior criminal record. He gave evidence in the sentence proceedings. Tendered on his behalf was a psychological report. In it the applicant described himself as a loner, who had never really connected with anyone, apart from his best mate. He had been using computers virtually as his main entertainment for many years. There was no substance abuse history. He had come across the offensive material by accident, but had continued to download it.
	
	
	The psychologist concluded:
	


“According to Mr Fitzgerald his psychosexual development was experienced via means of pornographic content viewed on his family's computer. He posited that his 'whole life' revolved around the computer up until the day he was arrested. It would appear that Mr Fitzgerald became desensitized to pornographic internet content. He reported an overall interest and 'addiction' to all forms of pornography. He denied an isolated interest in material depicting children.”


	
	His Honour found that the applicant had shown contrition and in that regard, his Honour took into account that he had pleaded guilty to the charges at the first available opportunity and allowed a discount on sentence of 25%. His Honour found that he had good prospects of rehabilitation because he had never before been involved in any form of criminal activity and had fully co-operated with law enforcement agencies in the course of the investigation.
	
	
	In formulating his sentence, his Honour had regard to general deterrence and the fact that the children depicted in the material were vulnerable and had clearly suffered emotional harm.
	


The appeal

Ground 1 – The sentencing judge erred in his assessment of the offending and finding that there was “a significant number of materials and that places the offender's conduct at the highest end of offending"".


	
	The applicant submitted that when reaching that conclusion, his Honour did not take into account all relevant matters in that the number of offending materials was but one factor which a court is required to take into account. The applicant relied upon R v Minehan [2010] NSWCCA 140; 201 A Crim R 243 at [82] – [92] where matters relevant to the assessment of the objective seriousness of child pornography offences were set out. In Minehan the court identified 13 matters to which regard should be had when assessing the objective seriousness of such an offence.
	
	
	By reference to the check list in Minehan, the applicant submitted that the following considerations ameliorated the seriousness of the applicant’s offending:
	



	
	Of the 1,145 images making up the State offences, 364 (or 32.6%) were Category 6 involving animated or virtual depictions of children.
	
	
	There was no depiction of actual cruelty or physical harm to the children depicted in the material.
	
	
	The length of time over which the pornographic material was acquired should not have increased the seriousness of the offending.
	
	
	While acknowledging the serious nature of the offending, the fact that children 10 years or under were not featured in the material was an ameliorating factor.
	



	
	The applicant submitted that only about 25% of the material fell within Categories 4 and 5, with the balance of the images coming under the less serious classifications under the CETS scale. In those circumstances, it was not accurate for his Honour to say that the number of pornographic images was very large and that therefore the offending should be regarded as being at the highest end of offending.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that for those reasons, it was not open to his Honour to characterise the number of items or the conduct of the applicant as being at the highest end of offending, even allowing for the wide discretion which he had when assessing objective seriousness, and which was discussed by this Court in Mulato v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37].
	


Consideration


	
	The finding of objective seriousness was not based solely or predominantly on the number of images involved. In reaching his conclusion as to objective seriousness, his Honour took into account the matters set out in R v Gent [2005] NSWCCA 370; 162 A Crim R 29 (Johnson J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Adams J agreed):
	



	
	The nature and content of the images including the age of the children and the gravity of the sexual activity portrayed.
	
	
	The number of images or items of material possessed by the offender, including the number of different children who were depicted and thereby victimised.
	
	
	Whether the possession was for the purpose of sale or further distribution and;
	
	
	Whether the offender would profit from the offence.
	


His Honour found that the matters raised in (a) and (b) formed part of this offending but those in (c) and (d) did not.


	
	His Honour specifically took into account the nature and content of the images, the ages of the child victims, the gravity of the sexual activity portrayed, the number of images or items possessed and the number of child victims. He also specifically noted the absence of any evidence of sale, further distribution and profit.
	
	
	The 13 considerations identified in Minehan were essentially the same as those referred to in R v Gent but were broken into sub-categories. Additionally, his Honour also had regard to the matters referred to in s 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	His Honour correctly took into account that the production by others of child pornography for dissemination involved the exploitation and corruption of children who were incapable of protecting themselves and that the collection of such material was likely to encourage those who were actively involved in corrupting children and who recruited and used those children for the purpose of recording and distributing the results of such abuse.
	
	
	The true gravamen of this kind of offence was aptly described in R v Booth [2009] NSWCCA 89 at [40] – [41] where Simpson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Howie J agreed) said:
	


“40   … Possession of child pornography is a callous and predatory crime.

41    In sentencing for such a crime, it is well to bear firmly in mind that the material in question cannot come into existence without exploitation and abuse of children somewhere in the world. Often this is in underdeveloped or disadvantaged countries that lack the resources to provide adequate child protection mechanisms. The damage done to the children may be, and undoubtedly often is, profound. Those who make use of the product feed upon that exploitation and abuse, and upon the poverty of the children the subject of the material.”


	
	As his Honour recognised, general deterrence is of paramount importance when sentencing for these kinds of offences. This kind of offending primarily requires the imposition of sentences that will both deter others in the community from committing similar offences and which will punish and denounce the conduct of the offender. The ease and relative anonymity of the internet, the use by like-minded people of peer to peer file sharing technology to form networks exchanging such material and the difficulties of detection demonstrate the importance of general deterrence.
	
	
	In  R v Lee [2013] WASCA 216 McLure P (with whom Mazza JA and Hall J agreed) noted that with offences of this kind a term of imprisonment was ordinarily the only appropriate sentencing option:
	


“In relation to those offences in which a term of immediate imprisonment is ordinarily the only appropriate sentencing option, significant weight is given to general deterrence with the consequence that mitigating circumstances personal to the offender, including age and good character, are accorded less weight …” (at [31])

“… The application of these principles by this Court has the effect that a sentence other than immediate imprisonment for offences within this category is, as a matter of fact, exceptional …” (at [33])


	
	Comments to similar effect were made in R v Gent at [27]:
	


“27    …

“There can be little doubt that if the market for child pornography was reduced, then the numbers of children abused in this way would also be reduced. That means there should be a significant element of general deterrence when considering the question of penalty. Users of child pornography need to understand that, when detected, the penalty they will suffer is likely to be imprisonment for a substantial period of time in the hope – although perhaps futile – that some children, somewhere, will not be exploited in this way in the future.””


	
	It was not necessary for his Honour to view all or even most of the images and videos, the subject of this offending. It was sufficient for his Honour to have regard to the fact that 294 images and videos (25% of the total of 1145) were classified within Category 4 involving penetrative sexual activity between adults and children and that a total of 9 images and videos were classified within Category 5 involving children subjected to sadism, humiliation or bestiality. The extent of the cruelty and harm to the hundreds of individual child victims involved, is self-evident from the categorisation of the images and videos. Penetrative sexual activity between adult males and girls aged between 11 and 15 years of age and sadism, humiliation and bestiality involving children cannot occur without manifest inherent cruelty, harm and injury. The nature of the harm is readily discernible from the CET classification. No further evidence of the depiction of actual cruelty or harm was necessary.
	
	
	The period of time over which the material was accessed and possessed is an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(m) and s 16A(2)(c) and is relevant to the nature and circumstances of the conduct under s 16A(2)(a) and to relative seriousness under s 21A(1)(c). The relevance to sentence of the period of time over which child pornography was accessed, was acknowledged in R v De Leeuw [2015] NSWCCA 183 at [116] per Johnson J (with whom Ward JA and Garling J agreed).
	
	
	It follows that his Honour did not err in assessing the objective seriousness of this offending. This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 2 – The sentence was manifestly excessive


	
	The applicant submitted that his Honour’s starting point for the State offences of a head sentence of 5 years and the starting point for the Commonwealth offences of a head sentence of 3 years and 9 months was excessive. This was because there was a plea at the earliest opportunity, the applicant had no criminal record and the offences while serious, could reasonably be characterised as falling below the middle range of seriousness. He submitted that those starting points had to be looked at against the maximum sentence which, in the case of the Commonwealth offences, was 10 years for the early offending and 15 years for the later offending and in relation to the State offences, 10 years.
	
	
	The applicant relied upon a number of cases where either similar offending had received a lower sentence or where a similar sentence was imposed, but in relation to many more images.
	
	
	In R v SW [2008] NSWDC 148, (Knox SC DCJ) – 4,000 “still” images and 204 videos with transmission of images by the offender – head sentence of 3 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 2 years.
	
	
	In Mouscas v R [2008] NSWCCA 181 – Possession of 41,923 graphic images and 204 videos with very young children, animals and graphic violence – head sentence of 2 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 18 months.
	
	
	Martin v Regina [2014] NSWCCA 124 – 24 offences of possession, transmission and producing material involving 60,000 “still” images, 323 videos and 4578 “story” documents – history of sexual offences – aggregate sentence of 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years and 4 months.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that those cases were reasonably representative of the sort of sentences imposed for these kinds of offences and provided an indication of general sentencing trends and standards to which due regard needed to be had so as to ensure consistency in sentencing.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that for the reasons set out in Ground 1, his Honour had erred in assessing the objective seriousness of the offending and that this, taken with the sentence imposed being well out of step with the range of cases referred to, constituted House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 error entitling this Court to re-exercise the sentencing discretion.
	


Consideration


	
	The applicant accepted that the offences were serious and called for a significant component of general deterrence and called for a custodial sentence.
	
	
	As indicated in respect of Ground 1, each of the offences was objectively serious. When sentenced the applicant received a substantial benefit in that the non-parole component of the sentences was wholly concurrent. Had his Honour allowed some partial accumulation so as to increase the sentence, that would have been well within the sentencing discretion and no valid criticism could be directed at such an approach. This is particularly so when R v Porte [2015] NSWCCA 174 made it clear that the State offence and Commonwealth offence are quite distinct.
	
	
	The following considerations point against a finding that the sentence was manifestly excessive:
	



	
	The child pornography material accessed from the internet (96 items) were all videos.
	
	
	The quantity of child abuse material possessed was substantial (1,145 images) which included 390 videos.
	
	
	The material possessed and accessed included images and videos showing the gross abuse of children and which fell within the most serious CET Scale categories, i.e. 3, 4 and 5.
	
	
	The number of child victims was substantial – between 700 and 800 individual children were depicted.
	



	
	The cases which were brought to the attention of this Court do not establish a sentencing range. They depend very much on their own facts. Moreover, the sentences imposed in those cases while lower were not significantly out of step with the sentences imposed here.
	
	
	This Court has recently considered some Crown appeals against sentence in R v Linardon [2014] NSWCCA 247; R v Martin [2014] NSWCCA 283; R v Porte and R v De Leeuw. While there were differences in the numbers of images, the balance between videos and “still images”, the particular facts and subjective cases of the offenders, there was a consistency of approach and in sentence. In each case, the Crown appeal was allowed and the sentences were increased. The sentence imposed in this case is well within the range of sentences imposed in those cases. What that sentencing pattern reveals is a range of head sentences of imprisonment between 18 months and 5 years after a discount for a guilty plea.
	
	
	The sentences imposed here appropriately reflected the criminality of the offending and the culpability of the applicant. It follows that there was nothing unreasonable or plainly unjust in them. This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	
	
	The order which I propose is that leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed.
	
	
	PRICE J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
	
	
	BUTTON J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

		09 October 2015",2015-10-08 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2242307,Gaynor v Burns [2015] NSWDC 194,"Judgment


	
	These are reasons for the striking out of the defence of contextual justification pleaded in paragraph 7 of the Further Amended Defence and for requiring the defendant to file a First Further Amended Defence clarifying whether the defence of qualified privilege is pleaded solely at common law and/or s 30 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW).
	
	
	The plaintiff initially commenced proceedings by summons filed on 12 September 2014. The proceedings were case managed by the Judicial Registrar, during which time the plaintiff filed a statement of claim on 23 April 2015. The defendant, who appeared in person, filed a series of defences claiming “public interest” and “the public’s right to know”, defences unknown to law.
	
	
	Following transfer to the Defamation List on 5 June 2015, the defendant filed an “Amended Defence” on 16 June 2015 which added a defence of contextual justification based on the plaintiff’s imputations, which is impermissible (Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd v Kermode; Besser v Kermode (2011) 81 NSWLR 157). Given this unsatisfactory history of inadequately pleaded defences, I referred the defendant on 30 July 2015 to a barrister on the pro bono panel for the purpose of providing a further amended defence and the proceedings were stood over to today, with a warning that unless a defence in proper form was filed, the defence most recently filed may be struck out.
	
	
	A “Further Amended Defence” was filed on 11 August 2015. Although the fourth defence filed, it is the first to be prepared by a legal practitioner. It is a significant improvement on the previous defences, but two of the defences pleaded were the subject of challenge by Mr Rasmussen, namely the defences of contextual justification and qualified privilege.
	


The defence of contextual justification


	
	The defence of contextual justification was pleaded as follows:
	


“7. Further and in the alternative, the defendants say that insofar as and to the extent that it may be found that the matters complained of were defamatory of the plaintiff (which is denied), the imputations pleaded were published contextually to the other imputations pleaded in the Statement of Claim and by reason of the substantial truth of the contextual imputations such of the plaintiff’s imputations as may be found to arise did not further injure the reputation of the plaintiff.”


	
	Mr Rasmussen submitted, and Ms Curry conceded, that a defence of contextual justification as set out in paragraph 7 is impermissible, for the reasons explained in Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd v Kermode; Besser v Kermode. The question is now whether the defence should be struck out on that basis, or whether that is a step which should not be taken until the trial.
	
	
	Mr Rasmussen has asked me to strike it out now, and also requested me to provide short reasons for doing so, by reason of an imminent application in the New South Wales Court of Appeal in other proceedings for leave to appeal the striking out of this defence at an interlocutory stage rather than at the trial.
	
	
	Mr Rasmussen’s reasons for this request arise from what is asserted to be an apparent conflict of authority between Born Brands Pty Ltd v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 369 and Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd v Kermode; Besser v Kermode as to whether such a defence can be struck out prior to trial, or at all. This argument arose following the handing down of Balzola v Federal Capital Press of Australia Pty Ltd (ACN 008 394 063) [2015] NSWDC 23, where the plaintiff’s application to “plead back” the defendant’s contextual imputations was granted, which meant that the defence of contextual justification based on those contextual imputations was no longer available. The s 26 defence was not, however, struck out, and the decision which is currently the subject of an application for leave to appeal is whether it should be struck out.
	
	
	The argument about whether the s 26 defence should be struck out at all, Mr Rasmussen tells me, proceeds on two alternative bases. The first is that the approach taken by the trial judge (and endorsed on appeal) in Born Brands Pty Ltd v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd require that the s 26 defence, although not tenable in itself, must remain in the pleadings until the trial. The second is that the defendant in Balzola v Federal Capital Press of Australia Pty Ltd (ACN 008 394 063) intends to argue that Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd v Kermode; Besser v Kermode is wrongly decided.
	
	
	Mr Rasmussen tells me (and it is evident from the contents of the judgment) that neither of these points was argued before the trial judge in Balzola v Federal Capital Press of Australia Pty Ltd (ACN 008 394 063). However, he seeks to protect his client in these proceedings in the event that the appeal proceeds regardless, and accordingly I note my reasons as follows.
	
	
	Firstly, both counsel agreed that I am bound to accept the correctness of Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd v Kermode; Besser v Kermode, and that the course in such circumstances is for such contextual imputations to be struck out, for the reasons explained by McCallum J in Rose v Allen & Unwin Pty Ltd [2015] NSWSC 991.
	
	
	Secondly, where a s 26 defence relies only upon the plaintiff’s imputations, either because the defendant proposes no other imputations (as is the case here) or because the plaintiff obtains leave to “plead back” the defendant’s contextual imputations, the invariable practice of the court has been to strike out the defence: see, for example, Rose v Allen & Unwin Pty Ltd at [27]. Where a defence is not tenable at law, the appropriate course generally is to strike it out, not to leave it in the pleading where it can cause confusion or uncertainty at the trial. Comity, case management principles and the desirability of clear pleadings, particularly in relation to a complex and difficult defence such as s 26, are the second set of reasons for my decision.
	
	
	Thirdly, it is not necessary for the s 26 defence to remain in the pleading for the defendant to be able to argue, in the event that the s 25 defence of justification succeeds in relation to one or more of the plaintiff’s imputations, that damages may be mitigated by reason of the truth of that imputation. The belief that the s 26 defence needs to be pleaded in order to preserve this right conflates s 26 both with s 25 and issues of mitigation of damages.
	
	
	Fourthly, counsel for the defendant says that she accepts that I am bound by Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd v Kermode; Besser v Kermode, and she consents to this course. Where a party consents to a case management order, courts generally do not look behind that consent, but I acknowledge Mr Rasmussen’s concerns about the uncertainty of the law in this area.
	
	
	Having noted these reasons, I also set out my reasons for requiring the defendant to replead the defence of qualified privilege.
	


The qualified privilege defence


	
	Paragraph 4 of the Further Amended Defence merely states that the matters complained of were “published under qualified privilege”, without identifying whether the defence is pleaded at common law, pursuant to s 30, or both. (The paragraph also includes a defence of “comment” [sic], which appears to owe much to the form of the defence under the repealed legislation.)
	
	
	The particulars of qualified privilege are as follows:
	


“Particulars of Qualified Privilege

(a) The matters were published to their recipients who had an interest or apparent interest in matters of discrimination, including discrimination against homosexual Australians;

(b) The matters were published in the course of giving information on that subject to the recipients;

(c) The defendant’s conduct was, in the circumstances, reasonable; and

(d) The defendant repeats the above particulars of public interest.”


	
	The particulars of public interest, referred to in subparagraph (d), are as follows:
	


“Particulars of Public Interest

(a) The rights of homosexual Australians;

(b) Anti-discrimination law in Australia;

(c) The plaintiff’s conduct in vilifying and/or permitting the vilification of persons by reason of their sexual orientation.”


	
	These rolled-up particulars do not assist in identifying whether the defence is published on an occasion of qualified privilege at common law, pursuant to s 30, or both. Ms Curry told me that the defence was pleaded at common law only but, given the reference to “reasonableness” and the difficulties of pleading such a defence to a website publication, that seems unlikely.
	
	
	The desirability of parties identifying with precision which qualified privilege defence is pleaded has long been regarded as essential. In Hanrahan v Ainsworth (1990) 22 NSWLR 73 Clarke JA (at 100A) stated:
	


“Notwithstanding, where both types of qualified privilege are pleaded it is imperative, in my view, that the trial judge, who concludes that the defence has been made out, express clearly whether he is upholding the defence of statutory or common law privilege. The reasons why he should do so are, if I might respectfully say so, obvious and are similar to those outlined by Moffitt P in Wright v Australian Broadcasting Commission [1977] 1 NSWLR 697 at 701 et seq, when dealing with the duty to give reasons.”


	
	In those proceedings, the defence had accurately pleaded both common law and statutory qualified privilege, and the failure to identify whether the successful defence was statutory or at common law was the failure of the trial judge. That failure resulted in the proceedings being remitted for retrial. It must follow that it would be equally unacceptable for a defendant to plead a defence of qualified privilege without identifying whether the defence was pleaded at common law, pursuant to s 30, or both.
	
	
	The defence must be repleaded with precision to identify, both in relation to pleading and particulars, which of the defences is relied upon, together with the appropriate particulars for each such defence.
	


Costs


	
	This is the fourth defence provided by the defendant. A fifth defence will be required.
	
	
	While I note that the defendant represented himself until recently, and that this was the reason for the defects in the previous defences, the current defence has repeated the flawed s 26 pleading in the third defence as well as failing to articulate the basis for the qualified privilege defence, and amendment is necessary. Additionally, Ms Curry has foreshadowed a challenge to the form and capacity of imputations (a) – (d), an application which should have been brought while the proceedings were before the Judicial Registrar, or first placed in the Defamation List on 5 June 2015. That application must be heard before the proceedings can go further.
	
	
	In those circumstances, the defendant must not only pay the costs thrown away by reason of the amendments required, but also the costs of today
	


Orders


	
	Note that paragraph 7 of the defence is struck out (Judge Gibson to give reasons at the suggestion of Mr Rasmussen).
	
	
	Grant leave to the defendant to file and serve an Amended Defence identifying the qualified privilege defence and, if s 30 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) is pleaded, setting out particulars of reasonableness, in 13 days.
	
	
	Any capacity argument is to be raised when the matter is next listed, failing which the court will direct that the imputations, as currently pleaded, will go to trial.
	
	
	Matter listed for an imputation argument on Thursday 17 September 2015 at 9:00am.
	
	
	The defendant is to pay the costs thrown away by reason of the amendments to the defence.
	
	
	The defendant is to pay the plaintiff’s costs of today.

		07 September 2015",2015-09-02 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2242437,Ha v Cho [2015] NSWDC 169,"Judgment


	
	The plaintiff commenced proceedings against the defendant, Kiu Nam Cho, by statement of claim filed on 21 April 2015. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant “caused to be published” two articles in the Korean Times Australia and in Topnews . The matters complained of consisted only of two sentences published in the first newspaper article and four sentences published in the second article.
	
	
	As the defendant was not sued for what he said to the journalist, but for two sentences plucked out from a longer interview, the plaintiff was granted leave to amend. The amended statement of claim, instead of pleading the slander published by the defendant to each of these newspapers, relied upon the whole of the newspaper publications, in circumstances where the defendant was asserted to be liable for the whole of both publications, in circumstances where it is clear both newspapers interviewed a series of persons in an attempt to portray both sides of the story. Counsel for the plaintiff acknowledged the force of the line of authority set out by McCallum J in Zeccola v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 1007 and a third amended pleading was then served.
	
	
	The current statement of claim, which supersedes two earlier versions, was filed on 30 June 2015 and repeats the errors of the first two versions, in that all that is done is to identify (by line references) extracts from the first and second publications for which it is asserted the defendant (hereafter referred to as “the first defendant”, as the publishers of the first matter complained of have also been joined). In the course of argument, Mr Rollinson, for the plaintiff, has explained that the claim is not for the publication of the slander by the defendant to the journalist, but for liability for those parts of that conversation that the journalist elected to place in the newspaper, and that this is the explanation for the artificiality of the disjointed statements upon which the plaintiff is sued. The issue before the court is whether the plaintiff is entitled to do so.
	
	
	There is also an application before the court by the first defendant for the plaintiff to pay the costs thrown away by reason of these amendments, which followed careful explanations of the relevant principles in correspondence from the solicitors for the defendants, on an indemnity basis. Additionally, there is an application for costs in relation to the deferring of the argument as to the form and capacity of the imputations (joined in by the second and third defendants).
	
	
	These are my reasons for my rulings on 13 August 2015. I shall first set out the current pleading by the plaintiff of his cause of action.
	


The pleading


	
	Paragraphs 5 to 8 of the statement of claim are pleaded as follows:
	


“5. On or before 5 December 2014, the exact date being unknown to the Plaintiff, the First Defendant communicated to the Third Defendant, and/or to other employees or agents of the KTA, matter defamatory of the Plaintiff:

a. With the intention that the substance of the defamatory matter should be published in the KTA; and/or

b. In circumstances such that it was a natural and probable consequence that the substance of the matter should be published in the KTA.

The Plaintiff relies in particular on lines 4, 5, 7, 34, 36, 38-45, 47, 49-52, 54-57, 59, 60, and 62-70 of Article A. Further particulars will be given after discovery, interrogatories and issue of subpoenas.

6. The substance of the defamatory matter so communicated by the First Defendant was published by the Second Defendant and the Third Defendant in the KTA in Article ‘A’.

7. Article ‘A’ was so published to persons capable of reading and understanding the Korean language including the persons named Joseph Seo and Horim Song.

8. Article ‘A’ in its natural and ordinary meaning conveyed the following imputations of and concerning the Plaintiff, and defamatory of him:

a. The Plaintiff took part in an assault on the First Defendant.

b. The Plaintiff helped Horim Song to assault the First Defendant.

c. After assaulting the First Defendant, the Plaintiff ran away from the scene.

Particulars

The Plaintiff relies on the whole of Article A, but particularly lines 1-5, 24-28, 34-45, 49-50, 103-108, 114-124.”


	
	The whole of the newspaper article then appears. As it is a long article, I shall not set it out in full, but it includes lengthy quotations from the plaintiff, the first defendant, the Mr Song referred to in imputation (b), a lawyer, members of the Korean community, “sports people” and eye witnesses to the assault. The journalist expresses opinions, such as that the Korean community has been “disgraced by the shameful incident” and that one of the parties must be giving a false account of events.
	
	
	As to the second cause of action, paragraphs 9 to 12 of the statement of claim are pleaded as follows:
	


“9. On or about 13 February 2015, an article was published in the Korean language in Topnews, a newspaper published in both print and online formats and distributed throughout Australia by Top Media Group Pty Ltd (‘Topnews’). A copy of the article and of a translation into English are at annexure B (Article ‘B’).

10. On or before 13 February 2015, the exact date being unknown to the Plaintiff, the First Defendant communicated to Seung Hoon Lee, a reporter engaged by Topnews, and/or to other employees or agents of Topnews, matter defamatory of the Plaintiff:

a. With the intention that the substance of the defamatory matter should be published in the Topnews, and/or

b. In circumstances such that it was a natural and probable consequence that the matter should be published in the Topnews.

Particulars

The Plaintiff relies in particular on the fact that a general meeting of the Korean Sports Council was held on 7 February 2015; and that Article B purports to be a report of events at that meeting; and on the words reported as having been spoken at the meeting by the First Defendant at lines 74-82 of Article B. Further particulars will be given after discovery, interrogatories and issue of subpoenas.

11. The substance of the defamatory matter so communicated by the First Defendant was published in Topnews in Article B.

12. Article B was so published to persons capable of reading and understanding the Korean language including the persons named Joseph Seo and Horim Song.

13. Article B, in its natural and ordinary meaning conveyed the following imputations of and concerning the Plaintiff, and defamatory of him:

a. The Plaintiff took part in an assault on the First Defendant.

b. The Plaintiff was lying when he said that he did not take part in an assault on the First Defendant.

c. When the First Defendant had fallen to the ground covered in blood after being assaulted, the Plaintiff did nothing to care for him.

Particulars

The Plaintiff relies on the whole of Article B, but particularly lines 17-22, 43-48, 74-82.”


	
	The second matter complained of is a similarly long description of statements made at a meeting (nearly all in first person). The description of the relevant lines is of little help. For example, lines 17 – 22 is a reference to the “violent incident” written by the journalist which does not refer to information supporting any of the imputations; lines 43 – 48 are part of a long statement attributed to Chairman Ha (the plaintiff, not the first defendant) about the assault; lines 74 – 82 contain a statement in response to Chairman Ha’s address, referring to the fact that on the occasion the plaintiff referred to, he (the first defendant, Mr Cho) had fallen to the floor covered in blood, following which “nobody” had cared for him (line 82). This is followed by an apology from Mr Song that such a regrettable incident occurred and, it would appear, the replacement of the plaintiff by a temporary chairman “to restore the Sports Council to normalcy” (lines 83 – 109), some of which appears to relate to the conveying of the imputations in circumstances where the words of the first defendant play no part.
	


The parties’ submissions


	
	The plaintiff’s answer to these complaints is, firstly, that he is not bringing a claim based on what was said by the first defendant to the newspaper publishers, but for that portion of what was said which has been published in the newspaper.
	
	
	Secondly, it is submitted that the plaintiff has provided enough information as to publication for a cause of action to be established and that is it is “therefore legitimate for him to reserve the right to supply further particulars after discovery, interrogatories and issue of subpoenas, should applications for any of these provide necessary: Kaiser v George Laurens (NSW) Pty Ltd [1980] 1 NSWLR 294. After the defendants have pleaded their defences, the plaintiff “may” bring such an application if so advised (written submissions, paragraph 6) but, as long as the plaintiff can establish the “gist” of such a publication having been made, that is all that the plaintiff is required to do.
	
	
	Mr Richardson, for the first defendant, submits that the current form of the pleading suffers from the same vice of failing to separate the matter complained of which was published in the two newspapers from the information the first defendant provided to journalists employed by the newspapers as part of the information used to compile those newspaper reports. The difficulty remains, as was the case with earlier pleadings, that the primary publication (namely the slander published to the journalist) is not identified in its entirety, in haec verba. All that the plaintiff does is to identify some line numbers from the newspaper articles, which Mr Richardson submits is “not good enough”. The plaintiff must set out the words spoken to the journalist in order for the sense and substance of this publication to be clear, and for the relevant imputations to be identified. He can only plead the publication the plaintiff actually made to the journalist, and not some artificially constructed publication fashioned out of extracts from the matter complained of.
	
	
	As to the issue of interrogatories as to publication, Mr Richardson submits that, in relation to the second, the plaintiff’s claim that he does not know what was said is particularly disingenuous, since he was present at the meeting (as its Chairman) when the words were spoken, and must have heard all that was said.
	
	
	This brings me to a consideration of the relevant legal principles.
	


The relevant principles


	
	The relevant principles for liability for publication are helpfully set out in Zeccola v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd (No 3) at [11] – [19] as follows:
	


“[11] I turn then to the merit of the defendants’ application. It is helpful to begin with a consideration of some of the older authorities referred to in the well-known passage from the judgment of Isaacs J in Webb v Bloch in order to gain an understanding of precisely what principle that decision stands for. In 1846, in the English decision of R v Cooper (1846) 8 QB 533, it was said by Lord Denman CJ at 536:

If a man request another generally to write a libel, he must be answerable for any libel written in pursuance of his request: he contributes to a misdemeanour and is therefore responsible as principal. He takes his chance of what is to be published.

[12] In that case, the parties held liable for a defamatory publication in a newspaper had expressly requested the editor of the newspaper to “shew K up” (at 533). The libel is reported (at 533) as having:

imputed that the myrmidons of the prosecutor had poisoned some foxes, in the country hunted over by the hounds of Sir W.M. Stanley and had hung their bodies up by the neck; and that the tenantry of Sir W. M. Stanley, by way of retaliation, had hung up effigies of the prosecutor and his brother, with foxes’ tails appended. Some comments were added, exhibiting the prosecutor in a ludicrous light with respect to those transactions.

[13] Critical to an understanding of the basis on which liability was attributed in that case is the fact that there was a specific request by the defendants to the journalist or editor to publish the libel, combined with the fact that the libel was substantially that which had been communicated to the editor by those persons.

[14] The next authority which warrants consideration is the decision of Parkes v Prescott (1869) LR. 4 EX 169. That was a case with some similarity to R v Cooper. In particular, two people had, at a meeting, expressly requested journalists to make a report of what was referred to as “this very scandalous case” concerning the plaintiff. The chairman of the meeting had called upon another participant of the meeting to tell the story and each had expressly invited the local press to take notice of the story, one saying, “I am glad gentlemen of the press are in the room and I hope they will take notice of it.” The other had responded, “And so do I” The report of the decision states that the reporters (journalists) had given evidence at the trial that what was published in the newspaper was “a correct summary of what took place” at the meeting.

[15] The trial judge directed the jury to enter a verdict for the defendants on the ground that there was insufficient evidence for their consideration of the publication of the libels by the two men who had attended the meeting. That was held by a majority of three to two to have been a misdirection, importantly in light of the following two considerations: first, the fact that there had been an express request at the meeting to publish the proceedings of the meeting relating to the plaintiff’s conduct; and secondly, the evidence of the journalists that the reports contained a correct account of the proceedings “as the defendants meant it should appear“.

[16] Webb v Bloch is the Australian decision frequently cited as stating the extent of liability for participation in the publication of a libel, and those authorities are referred to in that decision. It is common in this jurisdiction for parties to cite portions of the judgment of Isaacs J in Webb v Bloch at 364 as the point in the judgment at which the relevant principle is stated. Interestingly, one of the passage of his Honour’s judgment often cited is a quote from the report of Parkes v Prescott, but what is quoted is the argument of Giffard QC who, in turn, is quoting from the second edition of Starkie on Libel. In other words, one of the often-cited passages from Webb v Bloch is a passage from a text book cited in argument by Giffard QC in Parkes v Prescott.

[17] That passage states:

All who are in any degree accessory to the publication of a libel, and by any means whatever conduce to the publication, are to be considered as principals in the act of publication : thus if one suggest illegal matter in order that another may write or print it, and that a third may publish it, all are equally amendable for the act of publication when it has been so effected.

[18] The import of that discrete statement must be understood in the context of what Parkes v Prescott decided, and also with regard to what Webb v Bloch decided. Webb v Bloch was, again, a case of publication at the request of the defendants. The defendants had instructed a solicitor to prepare the circular which was ultimately sued on. It may be accepted, as argued by Mr Rasmussen in the present case, that in the case of some of the defendants ultimately held liable for the publication of the circular, they had not even seen it in its final form. The relevant facts are set out at 355 of the judgment of the Chief Justice as follows:

The draft circular was sent by Norman to the defendant Bloch, and, so far as appears from the evidence, he was the only person who saw it. On 16th February 1926 the defendant Bloch telegraphed to Norman : “Issue circulars best way you think advisable forward us some copies.” At a meeting of the Victorian Committee held on 22nd February Bloch reported what he had done with regard to the circular, and it was resolved that his action in instructing Norman to issue circulars be confirmed. At this time none of the defendants except Bloch had seen the circular or knew what it contained, but the defendant Crocker was supplied with a copy on the following day, and the defendant Pratt saw a copy on 23rd or 24th February 1926. It does not appear from the evidence that the defendant Murphy ever saw the circular.

[19] However, what is significant about the facts of Webb v Bloch is that each of the defendants was a member of a committee that had condoned or joined in the instruction to the solicitor Nolan to issue the circular. Upon analysis, it can readily be seen that each of the decisions in R v Cooper, Parkes v Prescott and Webb v Bloch is ultimately a decision turning on the principles of agency. What is critical to each case is the fact that there was a request to publish combined with the fact that what was ultimately published was either a correct account of what was requested to be published or was authorised without the defendants having or exercising the opportunity to confirm that it was a correct account.”


	
	The first problem is the form of the pleading. Before a party can be fixed with liability for the publication (see, for example, De Jong v Victoria [2006] VSC 274), there must be certainty as to what the publication was. The current version of the statement of claim does not identify what the publication consists of beyond referring to lines in the newspaper articles, at least some of which are clearly wrong.
	
	
	Where each republication of a defamatory statement is asserted to constitute a separate cause of action, each publication must be set out in a separate count in the pleading (Brown on Defamation, at 19-130. Where more than one defendant is sued, “it is not proper to lump them together without first identifying what each of them said” (Brown on Defamation, at 19-125, citing Hyprescon Inc v Ipex Inc [2007] OJ No. 1327). Where the statement made by one defendant is republished by another, and one or both are sued for that republication, the plaintiff must set out the specific language of the republication separately for each. In Sims v Wran [1984] 1 NSWLR 317 at 320, Hunt J stated that “if the plaintiff intends to complain separately of that republication, he must plead each such republication in haec verba as a separate paragraph of in his statement of claim, to enable the defendant to plead to it whatever defence may be appropriate to that particular publication”.
	
	
	Hunt J’s statement has been referred to with approval by the NSW Court of Appeal in Bracks v Smyth-Kirk [2009] NSWCA 401 at [53]; see also Day v Harness Racing New South Wales [2015] NSWSC 836 at [14].
	
	
	The plaintiff’s continued failure to set out precisely what the first defendant said is only the first problem. The second problem is that the plaintiff has a choice between pleading the words spoken to the journalist in circumstances where republication was the natural and probable consequence, or the newspaper article itself, or both. What the plaintiff cannot do is to construct, artificially, a matter complained of consisting only of those parts which the journalist decided to include in the newspaper article.
	
	
	Precision as to what was said is important, particularly in relation to the second matter complained of, where it is clear that other imputations may arise from what the first defendant said at the meeting which, if the publication is set out in full, give rise to contextual imputations. Additionally, the parameters of other defences (including any claim of reply to attack) can only be established when the precise text of the matter complained of is pleaded.
	
	
	Nor is it open to the plaintiff to plead only some part of the matter complained of on the basis that he can, after the defences are pleaded, revisit and embroider the text of the publication by use of the principles enunciated in Kaiser v George Laurens (NSW) Pty Ltd. A plaintiff who is in doubt as to what was said should bring such an application expeditiously, or run the risk of orders of the kind made in Dank v Cronulla Sutherland District Rugby League Football Club Ltd [2014] NSWCA 288. Given the circumstances in which the plaintiff was present at the meeting about which the journalist was reporting, and in fact was its chairman, there would need to be compelling reasons for the granting of such an application.
	
	
	Although Mr Richardson formally submitted that the whole claim should be struck out against his client, he acknowledged that it was “early days” to do so, and accordingly the plaintiff has been granted leave to replead. However, this will be the fourth amended statement, and liberty to replead may be more difficult to obtain if the next pleading does not set out the relevant publications sued upon in haec verba.
	
	
	The plaintiff should also take into account, when repleading his claim, the objections raised in relation to the imputations pleaded, although whether these are to be amended as a result will be an issue for determination by the pleader.
	


Costs


	
	Mr Richardson tendered correspondence in which his instructing solicitors had carefully and fairly set out the relevant principles of law. The first defendant’s representatives had previously raised these issues informally in court, in the expectation that a pleading in proper form would result. The solicitors for the plaintiff do not appear to have replied to these letters or to the discussion of the problem informally in court, beyond agreeing to ament, but the plaintiff’s pleading has barely been improved upon since the first of his solicitors’ three attempts.
	
	
	While the power to award indemnity costs must be used sparingly, I am satisfied, from the very reasonable approach taken by the solicitors for the first defendant, that the delay caused to this litigation by the plaintiff’s series of defective pleadings is both considerable and unwarranted. Accordingly, an order for indemnity costs has been included in my orders. I have, however, reserved the costs of the imputations argument which could not take place today.
	


Orders


	
	Statement of Claim struck out with leave to replead.
	
	
	Matter stood over to the Defamation List on Thursday 17 September 2015 at 9:00am (imputations argument).
	
	
	Costs of the imputation argument are reserved.
	
	
	Grant leave to the plaintiff to file a Second Further Amended Statement of Claim in 14 days.
	
	
	Plaintiff to pay the first defendant’s costs of the application to strike out the statement of claim (including the prior applications) on an indemnity basis.

2242441,Application of the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police [2015] NSWSC 1170,"ex tempore Judgment


	
	This is an application for forfeiture under s 49(1) of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) (the Act) of a sum of over $11 million that has previously been the subject of a restraining order. There has been no attendance of the defendant today, and no representation of him. The threshold question arises whether I should permit the matter to proceed ex parte.
	
	
	In support of that proposition, the solicitor for the plaintiff read three affidavits. They establish that the plaintiff has sought to locate the defendant at both an address in Pyrmont and an address in Rockdale, each of which is derived from documents in Australia that are themselves based upon information given by the defendant at various times. Those efforts have not met with success.
	
	
	Documents have also been sent to an email address provided by the defendant. Eventually, all documents were received at that email address without the sender receiving any notification that the emails and their attachments had ""bounced"". That email address was provided by the defendant on an incoming passenger card of 4 February 2015 when he last entered Australia.
	
	
	Immigration records show that the defendant left Australia on 16 February 2015. Although it seems his destination was and place of residence is China, in truth one can by no means be certain that he remains in that vast and populous nation.
	
	
	The solicitor for the plaintiff has invited my attention to s 49(1)(e) of the Act, which speaks of the requirement that the plaintiff take “reasonable steps” to notify the defendant of this application. That phrase may be contrasted, she submitted, with the requirement that (for example) all possible steps be taken. She submitted that Parliament has mandated a test that strikes a balance of practicality.
	
	
	She also submitted that, as a matter of statutory interpretation founded upon reading the Act as a whole, s 49(1)(e) must be read in light of s 74 of the Act. She explained in short that, even if a forfeiture order were made by me today, it would not be irrevocable. In particular, pursuant to s 74(3)(a), if the defendant were able in due course to demonstrate that he had not, in truth, been effectively notified of this application, he may well be granted leave to reopen the question of forfeiture.
	
	
	Turning to my determination, I am satisfied that the plaintiff has taken reasonable steps to notify the defendant of the proceedings before me today.
	
	
	Accordingly, I consider it appropriate that the matter be heard ex parte.

		19 August 2015",2015-08-12 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2242442,R v Basanovic and ors (No. 4) [2015] NSWSC 1100,"Judgment


	
	The Crown sought to have admitted into evidence extracts from the transcript of an interview of Andre James at the New South Wales Crime Commission in about March 2013. After hearing argument, I indicated that I would reject the tender of the evidence and give reasons later. These are my reasons.
	
	
	The evidence from Detective Senior Constable Luke McAneny was that Mr James is at an unspecified address in the Las Vegas area in the USA and had said that he was not prepared to return to Australia to give evidence. On that basis the Crown relied on s 65(2)(a), (c) and (d) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). The admission of the evidence was opposed by all of the accused.
	
	
	There were two substantive aspects to the evidence. The first concerned the purchase by Mr James of a black Mitsubishi Triton formerly owned by Michael Basanovic. The second matter concerned what Mr James had been told by Michael Basanovic about what happened at the shooting of the deceased. There was also some relatively unimportant evidence about Mr James, who is a friend or acquaintance of both Michael and Wade Basanovic, collecting some clothes and picking up some medication from a chemist for Michael Basanovic.
	
	
	Two issues needed to be determined. First, was the evidence, although hearsay, admissible under the provisions of s 65(2)? If it was, was its probative value outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice pursuant to s 137 of the Evidence Act?
	
	
	Section 65 relevantly provides:
	


65 Exception: criminal proceedings if maker not available

(1) This section applies in a criminal proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is not available to give evidence about an asserted fact.

(2) The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, if the representation:

(a) was made under a duty to make that representation or to make representations of that kind, or

(b) was made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred and in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication, or

(c) was made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation is reliable, or

(d) was:

(i) against the interests of the person who made it at the time it was made, and

(ii) made in circumstances that make it likely that the representation is reliable.

Note. Section 67 imposes notice requirements relating to this subsection.

…

(7) Without limiting subsection (2) (d), a representation is taken for the purposes of that subsection to be against the interests of the person who made it if it tends:

(a) to damage the person’s reputation, or

(b) to show that the person has committed an offence for which the person has not been convicted, or

(c) to show that the person is liable in an action for damages.

…

Note. Clause 4 of Part 2 of the Dictionary is about the availability of persons


	
	Clause 4 of the Dictionary provides:
	


4 Unavailability of persons

(1) For the purposes of this Act, a person is taken not to be available to give evidence about a fact if:

…

(f) all reasonable steps have been taken, by the party seeking to prove the person is not available, to find the person or secure his or her attendance, but without success, or

(g) all reasonable steps have been taken, by the party seeking to prove the person is not available, to compel the person to give the evidence, but without success.

(2) In all other cases the person is taken to be available to give evidence about the fact.


	
	The evidence from Detective McAneny was that the enquiries in relation to finding Mr James commenced on 23 July 2015. Enquiries were made through the New South Wales police computer system and through Roads and Maritime Services. An address at [XX] Gordon Avenue, Summerland Point was identified and another police officer attended those premises on 25 July 2015 for the purpose of serving a subpoena. A woman at the house who identified herself as an ex-partner of Mr James said that he was not living at that address and was living somewhere in Sydney. She provided a mobile phone number for him and she told the police that he had been travelling out of the country on a regular basis.
	
	
	Since 25 July 2015 Detective McAneny had been telephoning Mr James on the number provided. The first time he was able to speak to him was on the morning of 12 August 2015, that is, the day before this application was made.
	
	
	Mr James informed Detective McAneny that he was currently in the United States of America.
	
	
	Detective McAneny spoke again to Mr James on the morning of 13 August 2015. He asked Mr James if he would be prepared to return to Australia to provide evidence in the matter and Mr James said he would not. He said he was not sure when he would be returning to Australia and he would not be prepared to give evidence via audio visual link. He was not prepared to leave the United States at least until after his fiancé, who was pregnant, had given birth. He would only confirm that he was in the Las Vegas area but did not provide any address.
	
	
	Detective McAneny said he had had no contact with Mr James since Mr James appeared before the Crime Commission in March 2013. The reason no contact was made prior to 23 July 2015 was because his name did not appear on the witness list or the subpoena list that he was given.
	
	
	The Crown accepted that it would be necessary to get some certification of the transcript from the Crime Commission since it is not signed by Mr James. However, the argument proceeded, and for the purpose of this judgment I will consider the matter, on the assumption that the transcript will be so certified.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that at the time Mr James was interviewed by persons at the New South Wales Crime Commission he was under a duty to make the representations contained in the transcript. Further, because it was made in circumstances where he was required to answer questions and to tell the truth it was highly probable that the representations were reliable. In any event, it was submitted that it was against Mr James’ interests to make the representations and it was made in circumstances that made it likely that the representations were reliable.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that Mr James was not available to give evidence because all reasonable steps had been taken by the Crown to find Mr James or to secure his attendance but without success. In that regard the Crown relied on the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v Kazzi; Regina v Williams; Regina v Murchie [2003] NSWCCA 241; (2003) 140 A Crim R 545. In that case the trial commenced on 5 August 2003 and the police only commenced their enquiries to find the witness on 26 July 2003. Nevertheless, the Court of Criminal Appeal held that the delay on the part of the police did not constitute a failure to take reasonable steps within the meaning of clause 4(1) of the Dictionary to the Act.
	
	
	The Crown accepted that the subpoena to Mr James should have issued earlier and the request should have been made much earlier. However, it was submitted, if the Crown had managed to subpoena the witness that would not have prevented him from leaving the country which was likely given what he has said about his fiancé who is due to give birth.
	
	
	In relation to s 137 the Crown submitted that the evidence of what Michael Basanovic said to Mr James had significant probative value because it is a prior inconsistent statement by Michael Basanovic. It was not made clear what other statement this reported evidence of Michael Basanovic would be inconsistent with. It would, however, be inconsistent with the evidence which Wade Basanovic’s counsel said would be given by Wade Basanovic (and possibly Michael Basanovic) at the trial. It was apparently inconsistent with what the Crown witnesses present at the shooting have said. The Crown submitted that for the prejudice to be unfair there must be a risk that the evidence would be misused. Reference was made to Regina v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; (2006) 66 NSWLR 228.
	
	
	In an email from the Crown to my associate, received the day after the matter was argued, the Crown relied on R v BD (1997) 94 A Crim R 131 at 139, R v Serratore [1999] NSWCCA 377; (1999) 48 NSWLR 101 and R v Papakosmos [1999] HCA 37; (1999) 196 CLR 297 rather than on Shamouil.
	
	
	The submissions on behalf of all of the accused did not contest that s 65(2) was applicable in respect of the paragraphs relied upon by the Crown. Their submissions, however, were principally directed to what they said was the failure on the Crown’s part to take reasonable steps to secure Mr James’ attendance. The result was, it was submitted, that Mr James could not be said to be unavailable for the purposes of s 65. They also pointed out that no Notice had been given under s 67. They said that they were prejudiced by the lack of a Notice because they may have been able to locate and secure the attendance of Mr James themselves. Reference was made to Quintano v B W Rose Pty Ltd [2008] NSWSC 1012; (2008) 186 A Crim R 448.
	
	
	The accused submitted also that even if the transcript was otherwise admissible the Court should reject it because of the unfair prejudice the accused would suffer. Where the material was relied upon as a prior inconsistent statement an inability to cross-examine Mr James would amount to unfair prejudice. Any direction to the jury to take care in the assessment of the evidence in the transcript and the weight to be accorded to it would be insufficient to overcome the unfair prejudice.
	
	
	The accused submitted that the material in the transcript concerning the disposal of the Mitsubishi Triton was of low probative value.
	
	
	In my view, the provisions of s 65(2)(a), (c) and (d) are made out. Mr James was, by virtue of the nature of the examination at the Crime Commission (s 27 Crime Commission Act 2012 (NSW)), under a duty to make a representation of the kind that he did. A combination of ss 25, 27 and 39 of the Crime Commission Act renders it highly probable that the representations were reliable.
	
	
	Although the representations concerning the acquisition of the Mitsubishi Triton might be thought to be against the interests of Mr James and were made in circumstances that make it likely that those representations are reliable, it does not seem to me that the representations concerning what Mr James was told by Michael Basanovic about the shooting of the deceased could be said to be against Mr James’ interests. In that way s 65(2)(d) is not satisfied for those representations. Nevertheless, I consider that in respect of both groups of representations paragraphs (a) and (c) of s 65(2) are satisfied.
	
	
	In my opinion Mr James cannot be considered to be a person who is not available to give evidence because the Crown has not demonstrated that all reasonable steps have been taken to secure his attendance. The Crown sought to draw a distinction between what steps were actually taken on the one hand and when those steps were taken on the other, to support the contention that the steps were reasonable. I do not think that such a distinction can be made. Whilst it is arguable that one would only have regard to the steps taken if the enquiry was whether such steps were reasonable steps “to find the person”, I do not consider that the timing of the steps can be disregarded when the enquiry is whether all reasonable steps have been taken “to … secure his … attendance”. In one sense, Mr James has been found because telephone contact was twice made with him although his precise location has not been identified. However, that is only a preliminary matter to what the true enquiry is. The true enquiry is whether all reasonable steps have been taken to secure Mr James’ attendance.
	
	
	I do not consider that Kazzi provides support for the Crown’s position. The reason the Court of Criminal Appeal concluded that the delay on the part of the police in making enquiries did not constitute a failure to take reasonable steps is to be found at [11] and [12] of the judgment where the following appears:
	


[11]   I accept the submission that the police should have commenced making their inquiries at a far earlier date, particularly having regard to the fact that the case was listed for trial last year. However, any inquiries made by the police at a time earlier than August 2001, as regards Mr Gujral’s whereabouts in Australia, would have proved to be fruitless.

[12]   The information as to Mr Gujral’s whereabouts in India is non-existent. It is not even known in which city he resides. It would have been a lengthy and expensive task for the police to make appropriate inquiries as to his whereabouts in that country. In my view it was not incumbent on the police to make inquiries in India. I do not mean to suggest, in expressing this view, that the police would never be required to attempt to ascertain the whereabouts of a witness, once it was learned that that witness was in another country. In the particular circumstances of this case, however, where nothing was known as to the individual’s address or business or family, and where the country concerned was as large and as populous as India, I think it is understandable that the police did nothing more.


	
	The position in the present case can be compared to Kazzi. The trial was fixed on 5 February 2015 to commence on 27 July 2015. There was evidence that until a few weeks before the trial commenced Mr James was in Australia although he was travelling out of Australia from time to time. In Kazzi it was accepted that if enquiries had been made by police at an earlier time they would have proved to be fruitless. That was not the position in the present matter. Had the appropriate enquiries been made in the months between February and July the likelihood is that the police would have ascertained Mr James’ phone number, as they ultimately did, and would have been in a position to serve him with a subpoena to give evidence at the trial. Even if, as the Crown asserted, Mr James had left Australia notwithstanding the service of the subpoena it would then have been difficult to maintain that reasonable steps had not been taken to secure his attendance. The service of a subpoena on a witness is a reasonable step.
	
	
	On Detective McAneny’s evidence the fault appears to lie with the DPP because Mr James did not appear on the witness list and the subpoena list that were provided to the police. No evidence was given by anyone from the DPP. In those circumstances Detective McAneny’s evidence must be accepted.
	
	
	Nevertheless, regardless of fault, there is no evidence from the Crown of any steps taken earlier than 23 July 2015 (three business days before the trial was due to commence) and no other explanation has been provided for that omission.
	
	
	In my opinion, s 65(1) has not been satisfied.
	
	
	Even if the evidence was admissible under s 65 it would be necessary to engage in the weighing exercise required by s 137.
	
	
	The parties seemingly agree that the representations concerning the acquisition of the Mitsubishi Triton are not of high probative value partly, at least, because there is other evidence of the sale of the motor vehicle by Michael Basanovic to Mr James within days of the shooting. There is no direct evidence in the transcript linking the sale of the motor vehicle to the shooting although, at the time Michael Basanovic asked Mr James if he wanted to buy it, Mr James was aware of Michael Basanovic’s involvement in the shooting. The highest the evidence went was the following passage:
	


Q.   And when he asked you - I'll withdraw that. How did he ask you to   take the ute?

A.   He said, ""Can you keep this at your place for a little bit?""

Q.   And where were you living at the time?

A.   Cronulla.

Q.   And was this a face to face conversation?

A.   Yes

Q.   And did you ask him why?

A.   He said it might be a bit hot.

Q.   And what did you understand that to mean?   

A.   That it could be getting looked at by the police.


	
	I consider that the evidence in relation to the acquisition by Mr James of the Mitsubishi Triton has some probative value in showing Michael Basanovic’s involvement in the shooting of the deceased but that its probative value is relatively small in the light of other evidence. That other evidence is the acceptance by Michael Basanovic that he was present at the time of the shooting and the evidence demonstrating that the Mitsubishi Triton was a vehicle in which persons involved in going to Dynamic Transport’s premises at the time of the shooting travelled.
	
	
	The evidence sought to be relied upon by the Crown showing a prior inconsistent statement has greater probative value. The evidence was this:
	


Q.   No. Now, you mentioned earlier in the evidence that I asked you what Mr Basanovic told you in relation to the murder of Mitrovic and you said nothing at that initial meeting.

A.   No.

Q.   When did he subsequently provide you with information about his knowledge of that matter?

A.   Just bits, bits and pieces throughout the time that I was, that I saw him.

Q.   To the best of your ability, can you tell us what he said about that matter?

A.   Um… that him and Wade and another person went upstairs to an office

Q.   The other person, did he tell you who that was?

A.   Brownie.

Q.   Do you know who Brownie is?   

A.   No. I've, I've met him a couple of times.

Q.   Can you describe him to me?

A.   Tongan.

…

Q.   Right. Okay. Now, so he, Mr Basanovic, told you, he, Wade and Brownie went upstairs to what?

A.   To, to talk to Steve, was it? And they, they had an argument and the argument heated and they - he told me that Steve tried to lure 'em around the corner to where the offices where. He told 'em to come around, come around and let's speak around here and then it got escalated. I don't know what happened and he said, ""Fuck you"" and he went to grab something and ...

Q.   Mm. You’re actually indicating - putting hand towards the front of your pants.

A.   Yep.

Q.   So are you doing that or did Mr Basanovic show that to you?

A.   Mr, Mr Basanovic showed that to me.

Q.   Right. Okay. And so he said Mitrovic said, ""Fuck you"" and went - put his hand towards the front of his pants.

A.   Yeah.

Q.   And then what happened?

A.   And then um Wade shot him.

Q.   Okay. Now, did Basanovic Senior, Michael, tell you anything else about that matter?

A.   That was about it.

Q.   Did he tell you who was there at the time besides Wade and Brownie?

A.   He just told me what went, what went on up in the office, I think it was.

Q.   Do you know if there was anybody else there at the time?

A.   From what I've read in the paper, yeah I do.

Q.   And what have you read?

A.   Just that there were seven men that turned up.

Q.   Do you know the identities of any of those other people?

A.   I'm not sure. I, I'm not sure.

Q.   Have you been told by anybody the identities of other people that were there?

A.   I've heard something about a guy called Hollywood or...

Q.   Okay. Anybody else?

A.   I don't know who else was in there that day.


	
	Mr James’ account of what Michael Basanovic told him, therefore, has the deceased saying during the argument he had with the three men, “Fuck you” and then has the deceased going to grab something by putting his hand towards the front of his pants. It is at that moment, according to the account Mr James says he was told, that Wade Basanovic shot the deceased.
	
	
	There has been no evidence suggesting that the deceased went to grab something from the front of his pants immediately before Wade Basanovic shot the deceased. The CCTV does not tend to show that any such thing happened. The Crown witnesses present in the office (as I have said) did not give such evidence. The opening made by Mr Edwards on behalf of Wade Basanovic did not suggest that any such thing happened. Mr Korn on behalf of Michael Basanovic did not give an opening address.
	
	
	I mention these matters only to identify what might be thought to be a significant difference in the account of what happened at the time of the shooting as is recorded in Mr James’ transcript. In that way, the representations in that part of the transcript can be said to have significant probative value.
	
	
	The unfair prejudice which the various accused point to is that they will not have the opportunity to cross-examine Mr James to test his evidence about what Michael Basanovic is alleged to have told him. That is a significant prejudice because it would mean the jury had before it Mr James’ untested evidence of what he claims Michael Basanovic told him. The Crown would then use that evidence of Mr James’ to point to inconsistencies in what it is believed Michael Basanovic will say if he gives evidence as seems likely.
	
	
	In Shamouil Spigelman CJ (with whom Simpson and Adams JJ agreed) said:
	


[72]   There is now a considerable body of case law in this Court which emphasises the fact that the assessment of this element requires any prejudice to be unfair. There must be a real risk that the evidence will be misused by the jury in some way and that that risk will exist notwithstanding the proper directions which it should be assumed the Court will give. (See e.g. R v BD (1997) 94 A Crim R 131 at 151.) (I do not need to refer to the reasoning in some cases that procedural prejudice may be sufficient.)

[73]   To use the test of McHugh J in Festa v The Queen (2001) 208 CLR 593 at [51]:

“It is only when the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by its prejudicial effect that the Crown can be deprived of the use of relevant but weak evidence. And evidence is not prejudicial merely because it strengthens the prosecution case. It is prejudicial only when the jury are likely to give the evidence more weight than it deserves or when the nature or contents of the evidence may influence the jury or divert the jurors from their task.”

(See also R v Lisoff [1999] NSWCCA 364 and R v Yates [2002] NSWCCA 520 at [252].)


	
	Both BD and Papaksomos concerned the relationship between ss 66 and 136 of the Evidence Act.  Hunt CJ at CL pointed out (at 139) in BD that both ss136 and 137 used the term “unfair prejudice” or a cognate and that the meaning of each must be the same.. He then said what “unfair prejudice” meant, (a view endorsed in Papakosmos at [91]) and that meaning is set out by Spigelman CJ in Shamouil at [72].
	
	
	For the prejudice to be unfair prejudice there must be a real risk that the evidence will be misused by the jury in some way notwithstanding proper directions. In the present case the jury would need to be given a warning under s 165 of the Evidence Act that the evidence may be unreliable because the evidence is untested by cross-examination. The jury would need to be told that they would need to be careful about the weight that they attributed to such untested evidence.
	
	
	One way that the evidence might be misused by a jury is when they are likely to give the evidence more weight than it deserves, as McHugh J said in Festa at [51] (see [37] above).
	
	
	In the present matter I consider that it is likely that the jury would give this evidence more weight than it deserves. The evidence would be coming to the jury as the transcript of an examination Mr James underwent at the NSW Crime Commission where he was required to answer questions and was at risk of prosecution if he gave false evidence. A jury is likely to place some weight on the circumstances that the evidence came into being.
	
	
	Moreover, in the present trial a great deal of evidence has been given by police officers who have read portions of their statements and have not been cross-examined on them. Further, there have been a number of statements of various witnesses read to the jury where those witnesses were not required to be present to be cross-examined.
	
	
	Directions will be given to the jury about all of those matters including a direction that where evidence has not been challenged the jury might consider it to be reliable and able to be accepted. However, the jury would be required to carve out from that direction the evidence of Mr James although it came to them in a similar fashion from other evidence that was unchallenged and could be reliably accepted.
	
	
	According less weight to unchallenged evidence where it was not possible to challenge that evidence for some reason is a difficult task even for judges. There is a likelihood that the jury in the present case, faced with this unchallenged evidence, and in the context of a large amount of other unchallenged evidence which the jury will be told they can accept as reliable, will give more weight to this evidence than it deserves, and in that way there is a real risk that the jury will misuse this evidence.
	
	
	For these reasons I consider that there is unfair prejudice to the accused by the admission of this evidence and that that danger outweighs the probative value of the evidence.
