        REGINA v P L V 
         
        
        
        
       The Appellant was charged with six counts alleging sexual offences against his younger sister. He was acquitted on five of those counts. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on one count of sexual intercourse. There was no evidence other than that of the complainant on any of the five counts on which the Appellant was acquitted. On the one count on which the Appellant was convicted, the younger brother of the complainant and the Appellant, gave evidence which was corroborative of the complainant’s evidence. 
        
        
       Each of the incidents was alleged to have occurred in a period from 1973 to 1974. In that period the complainant was eleven to twelve years old. The Appellant was seventeen to eighteen years old. The complainant complained to the police in December 1996. The trial was conducted in March 2000.  
       
      
      
       
       A. Inconsistent Verdicts 
       
      
      
       
       per Spigelman CJ, Simpson J and Smart AJ agreeing: 
        
        
       The jury’s one verdict of guilty is reasonable having regard to the five verdicts of not guilty. The corroborative evidence given by the younger brother on one count, and the lack of corroboration on all other counts, entitled the jury to differentiate between the counts.  
       Jones v The Queen 
        (1997) 191 CLR 439 distinguished. 
        
        
       B. Delay in Complaint 
       
      
      
       
       per Spigelman CJ, Simpson J and Smart AJ agreeing: 
        
        
       The directions given by the trial judge to the jury, in circumstances where there was a delay of more than 25 years between the alleged occurrence of the events in question and the time of the trial, may well not have satisfied the requirements of  
       Longman v The Queen 
        (1989) 168 CLR 75 at 91 and  
       Crampton v The Queen 
        (2000) 75 ALJR 133; [2000] HCA 60. However, the aspect of  
       Crampton 
        and  
       Longman 
        relied on by the Appellant refers to the danger of convicting on the complainant’s evidence  
       alone 
       . Because the jury only convicted where there was corroboration, no miscarriage of justice arose from the failure to give the direction. 
       
      
      
       
       C. Unreliability of witnesses 
       
      
      
       
       per Spigelman CJ, Simpson J and Smart AJ agreeing: 
        
        
       There is no requirement that a warning about the fragility of youthful recollection need be given in all cases in which evidence is given by a witness about events that happened when the witness was a child. Section 165 of the  
       Evidence Act 
        1995;  
       Longman v The Queen; Crampton v The Queen; KRM v The Queen 
        (2000) 75 ALJR 550; [2000] HCA 11 referred to. 
        
        
       The ages of the complainant and of the complainant’s younger brother at the time of the alleged offences were before the jury. The jury would have been conscious from its own experience of the potential unreliability of evidence recollected decades later by a person who was a young child at the time of the events.  
       R v Davies  
       (1985) 3 NSWLR 276 referred to. The point was not raised at trial and leave was required under s4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. Leave refused. Although his Honour could properly have given a direction of the relevant kind, in the circumstances of the case, no warning was required.  
        
        
       D. Fresh evidence  
       
      
      
       
       per Spigelman CJ, Simpson J and Smart AJ agreeing: 
        
        
       If the new evidence, to the effect that the complainant had indicated that her memory of the alleged events was only recently recovered, had been before the jury, there was not a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted.  
       Gallagher v The Queen  
       (1985) 160 CLR 392 and  
       R v Hemsley  
       (NSWCCA, 8 December 1995, unreported) applied. 
        
        
       Alternatively, the new evidence is relevant only to the credibility of the complainant and no exception to the ‘credibility rule’ was established.  
        
        
       It is  
       prima facie 
        excluded by the ‘credibility rule’ embodied in s102 of the  
       Evidence Act 
       . It is not within the exception to the rule provided in s103, which applies only to cross-examination and is therefore inapplicable to this new evidence, which was sought to be adduced as evidence in chief. 
        
        
       Section 106(d), also an exception to the ‘credibility rule’, would only be applicable if the words “or recall”, which appear in s104(3)(b) are ‘read into’ the section. Words omitted by the legislature are not to be supplied by the court.

       E. Application for leave to appeal against sentence 
        
        
       per Spigelman CJ, Simpson J agreeing: 
        
        
       Sentences are to be imposed in accordance with the relevant sentencing principles existing at the time of conviction; and not according to the standards existing at the time that the offence was committed. In any event, the sentence imposed, of two years with a non-parole period of three months, could very well be regarded, at any time, as lenient. 
        
        
       per Smart AJ 
        
        
       The sentence which would have been imposed at the time of the commission of the offence is to be taken into account, but it is not decisive. The sentence imposed in this case would have been regarded as lenient in the 1970’s. 
        
        
       The trial judge’s approach in assessing the Applicant’s criminality at the time of the offence, and his subjective features at the time of sentencing, was correct. 
        
        
       The delay between the commission of the offence and the complaint to the police and between the delay between the complaint and trial, were correctly considered by the trial judge. There was no error by the sentencing judge.

        REGINA v P L V 
         
         
        JUDGMENT 
         
         
        
       
     1    SPIGELMAN CJ: The Appellant was charged on an indictment containing six counts alleging sexual offences against his younger sister. The six offences were alleged to have been committed on three separate occasions. Four of the counts were said to have occurred in the course of a single episode between 25 December 1973 and 31 December 1974 when the complainant alleged that the Appellant digitally penetrated her vagina (Count 1), forced his penis into her mouth (Count 2), penetrated her anus with his penis (Count 3) and inserted his penis into her vagina (Count 4). 
      
       
     2    Count 5 of the indictment related to an occasion during 1974 when the complainant alleged that the Appellant had placed his penis into her vagina. Count 6 related to an incident also alleged to have occurred between 25 December 1973 and 31 December 1974, when the complainant and the Appellant were on a trip with a number of other people on the Nepean River. The complainant said that when they were separated from the rest of the party he had pulled into a beach and inserted his penis into her vagina. 
      
       
     3    It was not until 3 December 1996, i.e. more than twenty years after the alleged incidents, that the complainant made a statement to the police. The trial, the subject of this appeal, was conducted in March 2000, i.e. more than twenty-five years after the alleged incidents. The Appellant was acquitted of Counts 1-4 and Count 6. He was convicted of Count 5. Goldring DCJ sentenced the Appellant to imprisonment for two years with a non-parole period of three months. The Appellant was released at the expiration of his non-parole period on 16 June 2000. 
      
       
     4    At the time of the alleged incidents in 1973 and 1974 the Appellant was aged seventeen or eighteen. The complainant was aged eleven or twelve. They had a younger brother called SV who was seven or eight at the time of the alleged offences. SV gave evidence generally corroborative of the complainant’s case with respect to Count 5. There was no form of corroboration with respect to any of the counts of which the Appellant was acquitted. 
      
       
     5    As is usual in these kinds of cases in almost all respects the case was one of word against word. The evidence of the younger brother distinguished Count 5 in this respect. 
      
       
        
       Grounds of Appeal 
        
       
     6    The Appellant relies on five grounds of appeal. 
      
       
     7    The first ground is that the verdict of the jury on Count 5 in the indictment is unreasonable having regard to the acquittals on all other counts. The Appellant relies on Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439.  
      
       
     8    The second ground of appeal is that the directions given by the trial judge on the impact of the delay between the time of the alleged offences and the time of the trial were inadequate. It was submitted that a more complete and rigorous direction ought to have been given in accordance with the authority of the High Court in Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79 and Crampton v The Queen [2000] HCA 60; (2000) 75 ALJR 133. A direction was given of this general character which I will set out in full below. It was submitted that the direction was not adequate. 
      
       
     9    The third ground of appeal is that the warnings given by the learned trial judge alleging the possible unreliability of the complainant and the witness, SV, were inadequate. Specifically it was submitted that a direction as to potential unreliability of the evidence pursuant to s165 of the Evidence Act 1995 was not given. 
      
       
     10    The fourth ground of appeal relies on what is submitted to be “fresh evidence” that suggests that the evidence of the complainant was derived from a recently recovered memory of the complaint. 
      
       
     11    During the course of the trial a voir dire was conducted concerning the admissibility of the complainant’s evidence. The challenge to its admission was based on the proposition that the reliability of the testimony was affected by a process of recovery, sometimes referred to as “repressed memory”. The nature of the evidence relied on at the trial will be set out below. 
      
       
     12    The additional evidence sought to be relied upon in this Court asserts that the complainant had said, on two occasions, words to the effect that she had only recently remembered the sexual assaults that had occurred to her. The complainant denied that either occasion had occurred and asserted that she had always remembered the incidents. The Appellant submitted that the evidence of recent memory, had it been before the jury, may have affected the jury’s assessment of the reliability of the complainant’s evidence. 
      
       
     13    The fifth ground is an application for leave to appeal against sentence. The Applicant was sentenced to a period of two years with a short non-parole period of only three months. It was submitted that the delay in bringing the charge against the Applicant has occasioned him an injustice because it has exposed him to punishment as an adult and to what was submitted was a “harsher sentencing regime than existed in the State twenty-five years ago”. It was submitted that the Applicant should have been sentenced according to the standards at the time when the offence was committed.  
      
       
        
       Summing-up 
        
       
     14    In the course of the summing-up the trial judge emphasised the significance of the credit of the complainant. His Honour told the jury: 
      
       
        
         
         “Now in this case one witness is essential to proof of the Crown case and that is [the complainant]. You should therefore examine and scrutinise her evidence with very great care before you decide that a verdict of guilty should be brought in on each charge, if at all, and you should only find the accused guilty of any charge if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of the evidence of [the complainant]. The fact that I give you this warning does not mean that I have any view about her honesty or reliability, it is warning that is given in any case where the Crown case depends on the evidence of one witness and it does largely here. At this stage also I need to warn you, because of the time that has elapsed since these events, that the evidence of any witness after 25 years, may be unreliable simply because of the passage of time. We all know that there are some things we remember and some things which we do not remember as clearly and there are some things that are affected by the passage of time, so that is something that you must bear into account when considering not only [the complainant’s] evidence, but also the evidence of any other witness that relates to events so long ago.” 
         
        
       
     15    His Honour also informed the jury: 
      
       
        
         
         “There is no rule that you must or should put any witness and his or her evidence in a compartment as being totally reliable or totally unreliable. You have a right as judges of the facts to say of a witness that you accept all of his or her evidence, that you reject all of his or her evidence or that you accept part of it and reject other parts. You can arrive at a conclusion that any witness is accurate on some matters but inaccurate or mistaken in respect of others.” 
         
        
       
     16    His Honour distinguished two aspects of reliability of a witness for the jury: honesty and accuracy. He gave a number of useful examples to assist them in the task of assessing witnesses. 
      
       
     17    His Honour’s directions included the following: 
      
       
        
         
         “In respect of all the witnesses, you will have to decide whether the evidence they gave was reliable, that is whether you feel you can act on it safely.”  
         
        
        
       His Honour warned the jury about the evidence of the family members indicating that the close relationship “might sound a warning bell”. He expressly warned the jury to be cautious.  
        
       
     18    His Honour also elaborated on elements going to “accuracy” in the following way: 
      
       
        
         
         “First, how carefully did the witness observe the particular thing that they gave evidence of. Witnesses have told you that they saw certain things and the first indication of their evidence being accurate, might be the care or lack of care they took at the time in making that observation, and that is particularly in this case, where things happen so long ago, how well has the observation been retained. Some things we see or hear are so significant to us that we are likely to retain an accurate recollection of them throughout our lives. Other things are so trivial or at the time so unimportant that we are unlikely to remember them accurately for very long or at all.” 
         
        
       
     19    On the subject of delay, his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I must warn you that the mere delay in making a complaint does not necessarily indicate that the evidence of [the complainant] is false. It may indicate that she has made it up, but it does not necessarily do so. There may be good reasons why a person who has been sexually assaulted, does not complain to anyone, and the weight to be given to that evidence is a matter for your decision, not mine.  
         
        
        
         
         The reasons that [the complainant] gave was that these were things that were not talked about and she also said that she was frightened of her brother and he told her not to tell anyone. She gave evidence, you will recall, which he denied, that he used to abuse her physically, he used to punch her in the stomach and otherwise physically abuse her and both the other brothers [SV] and [CV], gave evidence that they also found [PV] dominating and they were frightened of him. 
         
        
        
         
         There is also something that you must bear in mind. I have warned you about the difficulty that arises from the delay between the events complained of and this trial, that delay also presents difficulties for the accused. Even though he does not have to prove anything, it does make it much more difficult for him to meet the allegations.” 
         
        
       
     20    Submissions were made in the absence of the jury to the effect that his Honour should give additional directions with respect to the effect of delay. When the jury returned his Honour added the following: 
      
       
        
         
         “I said to you earlier that this delay made it difficult for the accused to meet the allegations and there are two things, I think, that are particularly relevant there. In cases of sexual assault it is common to have medical evidence about the physical state of the alleged victim. Because it was twenty five years later it was not possible to get any medical evidence. It was also impossible after twenty five years for [PV] to find people who might have said that he could not have done these things because he was not there and that is a disadvantage about which you should be aware. 
         
        
        
         
         The other thing I should say to you is that you have heard [the complainant’s] explanation for why she did not complain. You have to take that into account. The delay itself is long and it may affect your judgment as to whether or not you accept [the complainant’s] evidence. It is a very long time and you should exercise very considerable caution before you decide to accept that evidence and convict the accused of any offence.” 
         
        
        
       Inconsistent Verdicts? 
        
       
     21    The Appellant and the Crown both accept that there was a rational basis for the differentiation amongst the six counts. The evidence of SV corroborated to some degree the evidence of the complainant on Count 5. There was no corroborative evidence on the counts on which the jury acquitted. 
      
       
     22    Nevertheless, on the basis of the reasoning of the joint judgment in Jones, especially at 453-455, it was submitted that the doubt experienced by the jury in relation to the five counts on which they acquitted diminished the overall credibility of the complainant and that there was nothing in the evidence of the complainant in relation to Count 5 which differentiated it in any material respect from her evidence with respect to the other counts. 
      
       
     23    The Appellant noted that the corroborative testimony came from a person who was only seven or eight years of age at the time. It was submitted that this evidence was consistent with a physical confrontation between his elder brother and sister, but did not necessarily relate to a sexual incident. 
      
       
     24    It was submitted that in all the circumstances the evidence of SV was insufficient to justify the jury accepting the evidence of the complainant on Count 5, when they were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of her evidence with respect to the other two incidents. 
      
       
     25    SV’s evidence was to the effect that he had heard the complainant crying in the Appellant’s bedroom. He said that he opened the bedroom door and saw the complainant lying on the bed and the Appellant lying on top of her. The Appellant jumped up, ran towards him and told him to “fuck off”. 
      
       
     26    The complainant’s evidence was generally to the same effect. She said that the Appellant yelled out the words “get out you little bastard”. There was some discrepancy between the two versions as to whether the Appellant was wearing underpants or a speedo swimsuit and whether the Appellant jumped up or not and whether the complainant was clothed. However, the evidence was generally corroborative and the discrepancies were before the jury. 
      
       
     27    The Appellant submitted that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the Appellant on Count 5. No submission was made that there was any defect in the directions that his Honour made in this regard. The differentiation in the results was sufficient, it was submitted, to conclude that the guilty verdict was unreasonable.  
      
       
     28    The joint judgment in Jones concluded at 455: 
      
       
        
         
         “When the credibility factor is combined with the uncorroborated nature of the complaints and the effect of the lengthy and unexplained delay in the making of the complaints, the convictions on the first and third counts can only be regarded as unsafe and unsatisfactory.” 
         
        
       
     29    The joint judgment had earlier referred at 453 to: 
      
       
        
         
         “ … the lack of any corroborative evidence, in particular, the absence of any medical evidence …” [reference omitted] 
         
        
        
       as a factor which: 
        
        
         
         “ … made it necessary for a reasonable jury to scrutinise the complainant’s evidence with considerable care”. 
         
        
       
     30    The absence of corroboration was of significance to the reasoning of the High Court in Jones in determining that the conviction in that case was unreasonable. In the present case, as noted above, the conviction occurred on the only count on which there was some corroboration. Although the testimony of the complainant was not regarded by the jury as sufficient to satisfy them beyond reasonable doubt when standing alone, the jury did reach that state of satisfaction when that testimony was, in material respects, confirmed. In my opinion, this is an acceptable and rational course of reasoning. 
      
       
     31    Other authorities since Jones have accepted that the presence or absence of corroboration is a relevant point of differentiation between verdicts of acquittal and conviction. In a number of cases juries convicted only in cases where there was corroboration and the court did not intervene (see e.g. King, Bull & Marotta v The Queen (WASCA, 19 January 1998, unreported); R v Petterwood (QCA, 11 August 1998, unreported); R v Hilsley [1998] VSCA 143 at [60] and [78]; R v KCW [1999] NSWCCA 112 at [95]-[96]; R v ARD [2000] NSWCCA 443 at [23], [121]-[124] and [201]). 
      
       
     32    In Jones at 453 the joint judgment said: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is difficult then to see how it was open to the jury to be convinced beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant with respect to the first and third count. There is nothing in the complainant’s evidence  
         or the surrounding circumstances 
          which gives any ground for supposing that her evidence was more reliable in relation to those counts than it was in relation to the second count.” [Emphasis added] 
         
        
       
     33    In my opinion the existence of evidence which corroborates the version of events given by a complainant in a material respect is a “surrounding circumstance” which entitled the jury to differentiate between the counts.  
      
       
     34    In my opinion this ground of appeal should be rejected. 
      
       
        
       Direction on Delay 
        
       
     35    The trial judge gave the jury a direction with respect to the effects of delay as quoted above. His Honour complied with the statutory obligation, now found in s107 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, and indicated to the jury that there may be good reasons why a victim of a sexual assault does not complain. He balanced this direction with another direction indicating that the jury should “exercise very considerable caution” before accepting the complainant’s evidence.  
      
       
     36    The Appellant submitted that his Honour should have gone further and given an explicit warning in the full form identified by the High Court in Longman v The Queen supra at 91: 
      
       
        
         
         “… it would be dangerous to convict on that evidence alone unless the jury, scrutinizing the evidence with great care, considering the circumstances relevant to its evaluation and paying heed to the warning was satisfied of its truth and accuracy.” 
         
        
       
     37    The significance of a warning in these strong terms has been emphasised in the subsequent High Court decision of Crampton v The Queen supra at [39], [45] and [132]. See also R v GJH [2001] NSWCCA 128 [31]-[39]. 
      
       
     38    It may very well have been that in the present case a direction of this character was appropriate. That may have been determinative if there had been a conviction on any of counts 1-4 or 6. However, there was no miscarriage of justice by reason of the absence of the direction.  
      
       
     39    A Longman direction, as affirmed in Crampton, refers to the danger of convicting on the complainant’s evidence alone. Even in the absence of an express direction about the dangers of doing so, that was the course which the jury in this case adopted. It refused to convict on the basis of the complainant’s evidence alone. It convicted only where that evidence was corroborated. In my opinion this ground of appeal should be dismissed. 
      
       
        
       Direction on Unreliability of Complainant and Corroborative Witness 
        
       
     40    The Appellant submitted that the trial judge should have given a distinct and express warning as to the potential for unreliability of the complainant and the younger brother SV, whose corroborative evidence proved crucial with respect to the charge on which the Appellant was convicted. The basis for the unreliability was the fact that they were giving evidence of events twenty five years ago, being events which had occurred when the brother was seven or eight and the complainant was eleven or twelve. 
      
       
     41    It was submitted that the potential unreliability of the evidence required a direction under s165 of the Evidence Act. Section 165 only applies if there was a request for such a direction. There was none at the trial. Accordingly, s165 does not apply in terms.  
      
       
     42    However, s165(5) makes it clear that a trial judge may give a warning with respect to potential unreliability of evidence, even if s165 itself does not apply. As Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ said in Longman supra at 86: 
      
       
        
         
         “… the general law requires a warning to be given whenever a warning is necessary to avoid a perceptible risk of miscarriage of justice arising from the circumstances of the case …” 
         
        
       
     43    The Appellant submitted that what was missing in the present case was an express reference by the trial judge that the potential for unreliability of the evidence of both the complainant and SV “based not so much on the passage of time, but on the fact that the witnesses were giving evidence about events which occurred when they were young children”. His Honour’s directions on delay did not in terms refer to the youth of the complainant and SV at the time of the events. 
      
       
     44    No submission that the failure to comment or warn about the reliability of the complainant or SV by reason of the fact they were children, was made to the trial judge. Accordingly r4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies. 
      
       
     45    In Longman supra McHugh J, with reference to evidence of a complaint, in a passage applicable to any witness giving evidence of what happened to them as a child, said at 108: 
      
       
        
         
         “… experience has shown that human recollection, and particularly the recollection of events occurring in childhood, is frequently erroneous and liable to distortion by reason of various factors …” 
         
        
       
     46    In Longman supra, Deane J said at 95-96: 
      
       
        
         
         “A trial judge has the general responsibility of giving appropriate directions to assist the jury in the performance of their function as the judges of fact. That responsibility includes the giving of an appropriate caution or warning in circumstances where there are potential dangers in acting upon particular evidence which may not, without such a caution or warning, be appreciated by the jury.” 
         
        
       
     47    These two passages were referred to in the joint judgment of Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ in Crampton supra at [40]-[45]. Their Honours concluded, after finding that the Longman warning should have been given, at [45]: 
      
       
        
         
         “Additionally, this was, in our opinion, a case in which the trial judge should, again with appropriate adaptation, when summing up, have drawn attention to the additional considerations mentioned by Deane and McHugh JJ in  
         Longman 
         : the abstention, by the prosecutor, from questioning each co-complainant about the respective charges, the fragility of youthful recollection, the absence of timely complaint (subject to any reasonable explanation therefor) and the possibility of distortion.” 
         
        
       
     48    The other members of the Court in Crampton referred only to the Longman warning at [5], [67], [128] and [142]-[143]. I do not understand the joint judgment to require a caution or warning about “the fragility of youthful recollection” in all cases. In any event, there is no decision by a majority of the High Court requiring a warning whenever evidence is given by a witness about events that happened when the witness was a child. 
      
       
     49    This Court should be slow to add to the number of directions and warnings which trial judges are required to give. McHugh J said in KRM v The Queen (2000) 75 ALJR 550; [2000] HCA 11 at [37]: 
      
       
        
         
         “The more directions and warnings juries are given the more likely it is that they will forget or misinterpret some directions or warnings.” 
         
        
       
     50    It is, of course, appropriate to make a comment on matters which jurors would ordinarily be expected to know. (See Crampton supra at [125]-[126]). Unlike Crampton, where there were a number of interrelated deficiencies in the summing-up, in this case only express reference to the “fragility of youthful recollection” was absent. In my opinion, that omission did not, of itself, result in a miscarriage of justice. 
      
       
     51    The Court does not have the addresses of counsel and is not aware of the submissions made to the jury in this regard. The potential unreliability of evidence which is recollected decades later by a person who was a young child at the time of the events is a matter which would be known to the average juror. It is not a matter of which the courts have become aware by reason of any special experience.  
      
       
     52    The age of the complainant at the time of the offences was adduced in chief. In the course of both his evidence in chief and his cross-examination, the youth of SV was mentioned. However, the cross-examination did not expressly challenge his recollection on the basis of his youth at the time of the events. 
      
       
     53    In R v Davies (1985) 3 NSWLR 276 the issue before the court concerned the failure of the trial judge to give a direction that failure to make a complaint could be taken into account on the credibility of the complainant in accordance with the High Court’s decision in Kilby v The Queen (1973) 129 CLR 460 at 465-466. Hunt J, with whom Slattery CJ at CL and Carruthers J agreed, said that a direction of that character should be given as a general rule. Nevertheless, the court held that the issue of the credibility of the complainant was plainly before the jury and notwithstanding the failure to put the Kilby direction in terms to the jury, leave under r4 was refused. Hunt J indicated that experienced counsel at the trial did not think it necessary to ask the trial judge to give such a direction. Counsel in this case made submissions about the need to add to the warnings given, and the judge did so. No warning about the youth of the complainant or her younger brother was sought. 
      
       
     54    In my opinion, the jury would have been conscious from its own experience of the potential for unreliability of evidence given, after more than two decades, by a person who was a child at the time of the events being recalled. To use the formulation of Deane J in Longman, this was not “evidence” the dangers of which “may not, without such caution or warning, be appreciated by the jury”. 
      
       
     55    This was a matter on which the trial judge could properly have commented, but was not such as to require a comment or warning. I would refuse leave under r4. Even if I had granted leave I would have rejected the ground of appeal on the same basis, i.e. the jury would not have been unaware of the potential for unreliability on the basis propounded. 
      
       
        
       New Evidence 
        
       
     56    Prior to the trial a voir dire was conducted as to the admissibility of the evidence of the complainant on the basis that the complainant’s memory had been recovered or reconstructed in such a manner that it was unreliable and, accordingly, was inadmissible. Alternatively, it was submitted the evidence was so unreliable that the trial judge should exercise his discretion under s137 of the Evidence Act to exclude the evidence. 
      
       
     57    Before the trial judge the Appellant primarily relied on this Court’s decision in R v Tillott (1995) 38 NSWLR 1 which drew an analogy between hypnotically induced testimony and the evidence of a person who had undergone a form of memory recovery known as eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR). In that case the evidence was held to be inadmissible. In this case the trial judge admitted the evidence. 
      
       
     58    The case for the Appellant before the trial judge was based on an expert opinion from a clinical neuro psychologist, Dr Andrew Gibbs, who gave evidence to the effect that the evidence of the complainant showed signs of being based on a reconstructed or recovered memory and was unreliable. The Crown called an associate professor of psychiatry from the University of New South Wales, Dr Quadrio, whose evidence to the contrary was preferred by the trial judge. 
      
       
     59    The complainant asserted, before the trial judge as in this Court, that she had never forgotten the general features of the abusive relationship she had had with her brother, although she accepted that she may have lost sight of some details. 
      
       
     60    One of the few pieces of evidence before the Court, on which Dr Gibbs had based his opinion, was a letter which the complainant had written to her mother. In his judgment on the voir dire the trial judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is true that within this letter there are statements that are consistent with someone who is trying to remember parts of things that have happened in the past but cannot remember all of them, but it is not, in my view, contrary to what Dr Gibbs says, self-evident that [the complainant’s] memory was being reconstructed. 
         
        
        
         
         I prefer the evidence of Dr Quadrio who says that the statements in this letter are consistent with a person who does have a memory of the basic facts but has lost the detail. Dr Quadrio says this is common, and I accept that evidence.” 
         
        
       
     61    His Honour rejected the submission that the complainant’s evidence was inherently unreliable. He also refused to exercise his discretion under s137 of the Evidence Act to exclude the evidence. 
      
       
     62    The additional evidence which has become available to the defence goes to the issue of whether or not the complainant did in fact retain, as she asserted during the course of her evidence on the voir dire, a recollection of the general substance of the events of which she complained.  
      
       
     63    A witness, Ms Elizabeth Gunn, swore an affidavit in these proceedings indicating that she has known the family of the Appellant and the complainant since 1972. In her work as a primary school teacher she had contact with the special education needs of the complainant’s stepson. In that capacity she became aware that the stepson was upset and discovered from his teacher that it had something to do with sexual abuse allegations by the complainant against the Appellant. Ms Gunn said that she had a conversation with the complainant about this matter. She said: 
      
       
        
         
         “When I asked why she had waited so long to do something about it, she said that she had only recently remembered it. I asked how the memories had surfaced and she said it was at her natural son’s birthday party. I asked what had specifically triggered the memory. There was a long pause and then she said vaguely ‘A curtain moving at a window’. I asked her about what she had done when she had experienced these memories and she said that she had just continued with the party. She said that she had not exhibited any physical symptoms.” 
         
        
       
     64    A second witness, Ms Glenda Gilmore, who was a teacher of the complainant’s stepson, swore an affidavit and said that another teacher at the school, Ms Julie Sheppard, became the friend and confidante of the complainant. She said that Ms Sheppard had shown her a letter written by the complainant. Ms Gilmore said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The letter included a statement by [the complainant] that she had recently begun experiencing very disturbing distress. 
         
        
        
         
         She said that this distress was being caused by her having very recently remembered being sexually abused by her brother, [PV], when she was a child. She said that these memories were only just coming back to her for the first time.” 
         
        
       
     65    Ms Sheppard swore an affidavit about her conversations with the complainant about the complainant’s stepson. She indicated that the complainant had written a letter to her and annexed that letter to her affidavit. She referred to the evidence of Ms Gilmore and said that the letter annexed to her affidavit was the only letter she had shown Ms Gilmore. That letter made no reference of the character identified in Ms Gilmore’s evidence. 
      
       
     66    The complainant swore two affidavits in this Court. She asserted that she had always remembered what had happened to her and had never said that she had “only recently remembered it”. She said that she had no recollection of writing a letter of the character to which Ms Gilmore referred. 
      
       
     67    Dr Andrew Gibbs was shown the affidavit of Ms Gunn and found that the evidence about the recent revival of the complainant’s memory that Ms Gunn gave was consistent with his earlier opinion, which he reiterated forcefully. He said that the new evidence was consistent with his conclusion that this was a case of recovered or restored memory. 
      
       
     68    None of the deponents were cross-examined in this Court. 
      
       
     69    The Appellant’s submission in this Court does not assert that the fresh evidence was such as to require the rejection in its entirety of the complainant’s evidence. Nor was it submitted that the exercise of a discretion under s137 should have led to the exclusion of the evidence. It was submitted that this was evidence which may have assisted the accused’s case by having “a further impact on the jury’s assessment of the complainant’s reliability which might have rendered that evidence of even lesser weight, so that even when combined with the evidence given by [SV], it was still insufficient to establish guilt in relation to the fifth count on the indictment.” Nevertheless, the Appellant conceded that as the jury only convicted where there was corroboration, the new evidence “is not of compelling force”. 
      
       
     70    The new evidence goes only to credit. By reason of the denial by Ms Sheppard, an independent witness, the evidence of Ms Gilmore is entitled to little weight. In the absence of cross-examination in this Court of either the complainant or Ms Gunn, it is difficult to assess what, if any, impact that evidence would have had in the case, if admissible at all. The evidence of Ms Gunn has probative value, however, I am not able to conclude that if taken into account with all the other evidence, it may have given rise to a reasonable doubt about the complainant’s veracity. 
      
       
     71    In the case of “fresh evidence”, an appropriate formulation of the applicable test is whether, if the new evidence had been before the jury, there is a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellant (Gallagher v The Queen (1985) 160 CLR 392 at 396, 400-402; R v Hemsley (NSWCCA, 8 December 1995, unreported). The onus is on the Appellant to establish that the absence of the evidence resulted in a miscarriage of justice. 
      
       
     72    In my opinion, the Appellant has not discharged that onus. The jury did not convict on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant. The new evidence as presented to this Court does not have sufficient force to have led the jury to conclude that the complainant’s recollection was in fact a recent one. I do not believe that there would have been a significant possibility of an acquittal if the evidence of Ms Gunn and Ms Gilmore had been before the jury. 
      
       
     73    Alternatively, the Crown submitted that the evidence was not admissible. The new evidence is relevant only to the complainant’s credibility and, the Crown submitted, is inadmissible by s102 of the Evidence Act. This “credibility rule” is subject to the exceptions in Part 3.7. The Appellant invoked s103 and s106. 
      
       
     74    Section 103 refers to evidence adduced in cross-examination. The new evidence of Ms Gunn and Ms Gilmore is sought to be adduced as evidence in chief. Section 103 is inapplicable. 
      
       
     75    Section 106 relevantly provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “The credibility rule does not apply to evidence that tends to prove that a witness: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) is biased or has a motive for being untruthful, or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) has been convicted of an offence, including an offence against the law of a foreign country, or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (c) has made a prior inconsistent statement, or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (d) is, or was, unable to be aware of matters to which his or her evidence relates, or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (e) has knowingly or recklessly made a false representation while under an obligation, imposed by or under an Australian law or a law of a foreign country, to tell the truth, 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         if the evidence is adduced otherwise than from the witness and the witness has denied the substance of the evidence.” 
         
        
       
     76    The issue turns on the proper construction of the words “unable to be aware of matters” in s106(d). Section 104 is relevant: 
      
       
        
         
         “(1) This section applies only in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to section 103. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) A defendant must not be cross-examined about a matter that is relevant only because it is relevant to the defendant’s credibility, unless the court gives leave. 
         
        
        
         
         (3) Despite subsection (2), leave is not required for cross-examination by the prosecutor about whether the defendant: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) is biased or has a motive to be untruthful, or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) is, or was, unable to be aware of or recall matters to which his or her evidence relates, or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (c) has made a prior inconsistent statement.” 
           
          
         
        
       
     77    As can be seen s106(a) and (c), relating to bias and prior inconsistent statements, are in identical terms to s104(3)(a) and (c). There is however a significant difference between s104(3)(b) and s106(d). The former extends to a case where an accused is or was “unable to be aware of or recall matters to which his or her evidence relates”. The italicised words “or recall” are excluded from s106(d), so that it applies only to matters of which a witness was “unable to be aware”. 
      
       
     78    This is an important distinction for present purposes. The substance of the new evidence sought to be adduced is an inability to recall, i.e. the complainant had only recently remembered. It is not of a character which falls within the concept of inability “to be aware”. 
      
       
     79    The suggestion has been made that the omission of the words “or recall” in s106(d) may have been inadvertent. (See Odgers Uniform Evidence Law 4th ed par 106.6). The issue is whether this Court should construe s106(d) as if it applied to recollection as well as awareness. 
      
       
     80    There is a line of authority which suggests that the Court may sometimes “read words into an Act”. On my reading of the authorities, and I acknowledge that this is not the only possible reading, this is not an accurate description of what is involved in the process of interpretation that is sometimes so described. (See my discussion of the authorities in R v Young (1999) 46 NSWLR 681 at [5]-[32]).  
      
       
     81    It is no part of the function of a judge to supply words believed to have been omitted by the legislature per se. What a court does is to construe the words actually used by the legislature, with an effect as if certain words appeared in the statute. The words so ‘included’ reflect in express, and therefore more readily observable, form, the true construction of the words actually used.  
      
       
     82    The task of the courts is to determine what Parliament meant by the words used, not to determine what Parliament intended to say (see the authorities collected in Young supra at [5]). The task is to interpret the words of the legislature, not to divine the intent of the legislature (see State v Zuma (1995) 4 BCLR 401 at 402; Matadeen v Pointu [1999] 1 AC 98 at 108).  
      
       
     83    In a passage which has been frequently applied by Australian courts (see the authorities referred to in Young supra at [10]), Lord Diplock formulated three conditions for the process of “reading” words into an Act (Wentworth Securities v Jones [1980] AC 74 at 105). However, the opening words of the frequently cited passage by Lord Diplock include: 
      
       
        
         
         “ … the task on which a court of justice is engaged remains one of construction; even where this involves reading into the Act words which are not expressly included in it.” 
         
        
       
     84    To similar effect are the references as to how a provision should be “read” in the course of “adding or omitting words” as part of an “interpretative function” or a process of “interpreting a statute”, in the application of Lord Diplock’s conditions by Lord Nichols of Birkenhead delivering the judgment of the House of Lords in Inco Europe v First Choice Distribution [2000] 1 WLR 586 at 592.  
      
       
     85    In Inco the court took words of general application, namely “any decision of the court under that Part” and found that the particular composite phrase did not extend to the full scope of the dictionary definition of the words used. As a matter of construction, the phrase “under that Part” was read down so that it applied only to some sections in the particular Part of the Act.  
      
       
     86    The most frequently cited authority on legislative inadvertence in Australia, Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) (1981) 147 CLR 297 also involved a process of reading down words of general application, a recognised process of statutory construction (see Young supra at [17]-[22]).  
      
       
     87    The process remains one of construction if the words actually used by the Parliament are given an effect as if they contained additional words. That is not, however, to “introduce” words into the Act. It is to construe the words actually used. Interpretation must always be text based. The reformulation of a statutory provision by the addition or deletion of words should be understood as a means of expressing the court’s conclusion with clarity, rather than as a precise description of the actual process which the court has conducted. 
      
       
     88    The authorities which have expressed the process of construction in terms of ‘introducing’ words to an Act or ‘adding’ words have all, so far as I have been able to determine, been concerned to confine the sphere of operation of a statute more narrowly than the full scope of the dictionary definition of the words would suggest. I am unaware of any authority in which a court has ‘introduced’ words to or ‘deleted’ words from an Act, with the effect of expanding the sphere of operation that could be given to the words actually used. This was the actual issue in Young. There are many cases in which words have been read down. I know of no case in which words have been read up.  
      
       
     89    The introduction of the words “or recall” into s160(d) would expand the sphere of operation of that section. It is not, in my opinion, a permissible process of statutory construction. 
      
       
     90    In any event the conditions identified by Lord Diplock in Wentworth v Jones supra at 405 are not satisfied here. It is not “apparent” to me that the drafter has “omitted to deal with an eventuality that required to be dealt with if the purpose of the Act was to be achieved”. 
      
       
     91    I do not believe that this Court can be sure that Parliament intended s106(d) to have the same operation as s104(b). There is a distinction between s104 and s106. The former applies to cross-examination of an accused. The latter applies to the introduction of evidence contradicting the evidence of a witness, including that of an accused. Parliament may not have taken the same attitude to evidence by one person about another person’s ability to recall as it did to cross-examination of an accused about his or her own ability to recall. The two sections have different purposes. (See McNicol “Credit, Credibility and Character under the Evidence Act, 1995 (NSW) and (Cth)” 1999 23 CrimLJ 339 at 346-352). 
      
       
     92    In my opinion the evidence sought to be used was not admissible. Accordingly, for two alternative reasons, this ground of appeal should be dismissed. 
      
       
        
       Appeal against Sentence 
        
       
     93    The Applicant was sentenced to a period of two years with a very short non-parole period of three months. It was submitted that by reason of delay he was exposed to punishment as an adult and to a sentencing regime which it was submitted was “harsher” than that which existed in New South Wales at the time the offences were committed. The Court was referred to no authority in support of the proposition that sentences should be in accordance with practices at the time an offence was committed, rather than in accordance with practices at the time of conviction. I see no reason why this Court should establish such a principle for the first time.  
      
       
     94    I do not understand how a court would go about determining what it would have done twenty years before. The balance between the various objects of sentencing - deterrence, retribution, rehabilitation - does vary over time. The proposition for which the Appellant contends is both artificial and inappropriate. Sentencing should be based on practices extant at the time of conviction. 
      
       
     95    In any event, no information was presented to the Court which suggests that, in any material respect, sentencing practice with respect to this offences are presently “harsher” than they were at the time the offences were committed. Specifically, nothing was presented to the Court which would suggest that, what could very well be regarded as a lenient sentence of two years with a very short non-parole period of three months, would have been regarded at any time as a harsh sentence.  
      
       
     96    Leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal dismissed. 
      
       
        
       Orders 
        
       
     97    The orders I propose are: 
      
       
        
       1 Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
        
        
       2 Leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
        
        
       3 Appeal against sentence dismissed. 
        
        
        
       
     98    SIMPSON J: I have read in draft the judgment of the Chief Justice and I agree, for the reasons given by his Honour, with the orders proposed. 
      
       
        
       
     99    SMART AJ: I agree with what the Chief Justice has written as to the conviction appeal and that it should be dismissed. 
      
       
        
       Application for Leave to Appeal Against Sentence 
        
       
     100    There have been significant legislative changes since the offence was committed in 1974. The offences involving criminal conduct sexually have been redefined. The definition of sexual intercourse was widened. The concept of sexual assault was introduced. A greater degree of protection has been extended to children with increased penalties on those having authority over children.  
      
       
     101    Count 5 was laid under s71 of the Crimes Act 1900 which was repealed by virtue of Act 149 of 1985, s5 and Sch 2(10) with effect from 23 March 1986. Section 71 reads: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Whosoever unlawfully and carnally knows any girl of or above the age of ten years, and under the age of sixteen years shall be liable to penal servitude for ten years"". 
         
        
       
     102    The equivalent section under the present Act is s66C(1). The maximum penalty under that section is imprisonment for 8 years. However, under s66C(2) if the child is either generally or at the time of the sexual intercourse only, under the authority of the offender, the maximum penalty is 10 years. That provision was introduced in 1985. 
      
       
     103    Under s71 the Court when sentencing had regard, amongst other matters to the relationship between the offender and the victim. The applicant was five to six years older than his sister. His conduct represented a severe breach of his relationship with and duties to his sister. 
      
       
     104    Section 71 covered a wide range of offences. It included those cases where bonds were given, for example, where a 17 year old boy and a 15 year old girl willingly teamed up and encouraged each other and when a 15 or 16 year old boy and a 14 or 15 year old girl had an ongoing relationship which was not stopped by the parents and it was only because of the birth of a child that the offence became known to the authorities. On the other hand offences on girls between 10 and 12 by young men of 17 to 20 or older men were dealt with quite severely, including where the offenders were uncles, cousins, brothers or close family friends. These are but a few examples. The section had wide embrace and the factual situations it covered stretched from those exhibiting relatively little criminality to those exhibiting very serious criminality. The variations in sentence I have mentioned generally accorded with community standards and expectations. In his written submissions at trial the applicant's solicitor correctly wrote, ""There can be no doubting that the prisoner has been convicted of a very serious crime"". 
      
       
     105    Even though the judge was imposing a sentence in May 2000 he was required to assess the applicant's criminality as at the date of the commission of the offence in 1974. That means taking into account the applicant's subjective features as at that date. The judge noted that the applicant was aged 18 at the time of the offence and had recently joined the Army. He came from a dysfunctional family. He had no previous convictions. If the applicant had been dealt with in late 1974 or 1975 the question of his rehabilitation and his then character would have been important. We do not know what would have been recommended. As at May 2000 the question of rehabilitation did not arise as the sentencing judge pointed out. 
      
       
     106    While I would not regard it as decisive I would take into account the sentence which would have been imposed for the offence in 1974 or 1975. The weight to be attached to that factor, if any, will depend upon the circumstances including the mitigating factors which emerge. This is of some importance where the legislation governing the offence has been repealed. It is useful to do so as a check as to the correctness of the sentence intended to be imposed. 
      
       
     107    The judge correctly had regard to the position which existed in 1974 when the offence was committed and the applicant's present position. There are practical difficulties in trying to recapture the situation which existed 25 years ago. Reference to the odd decided case may not be helpful in trying to obtain an overall picture. While it is not perhaps the best source, there are judges who have a reasonably good recollection of the practice in the Courts and the sentences imposed in the period 1965-1980. There are judges who do not have such knowledge. If there is no substantial evidence as to that practice and the sentences and the judge is not aware of them then they obviously cannot be taken into account.  
      
       
     108    I do not have difficulty in recalling the approach of the Courts when sentencing for offences of carnal knowledge in the period 1965-1980. The case presently in question would have been regarded as a serious instance of carnal knowledge and attracted a substantial sentence. The sentence imposed by the judge would have been regarded in the 1970's as unduly lenient, having regard to the facts then known and the absence of the exceptional subjective features which now exist. 
      
       
     109    Frequently, when there has been a delay of 25 years between the date of the offence and the date of sentencing the subjective features have changed considerably. That has happened in the present case. If the judge had not taken into account the needs of the applicant's wife for extended care the applicant would have received a higher sentence including a much higher non-parole period. 
      
       
     110    In the present case the judge's approach to sentence was correct in that he assessed the applicant's criminality at the time of the offence and then took into account the applicant's subjective features existing at 1974 and today. The sentencing judge would not have been aware of the sentences being imposed in 1974 for an offence such as the present one. 
      
       
     111    The judge correctly considered the question of delay. A long time had passed between the commission of the offence (1974) and May 2000, when he was imposing sentence. The trial had taken place in March 2000. The judge referred to R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 at 519 where Street CJ stated that delay was a relevant factor to be considered. That case dealt with a different situation but the approach of Street CJ in Todd was approved by the High Court of Australia in Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 64 and 66. Inter alia, Street CJ said at 519-520: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Moreover, where there has been a lengthy postponement, whether due to an interstate sentence or otherwise, fairness to the prisoner requires weight to be given … … to the fact that sentencing for a stale crime, long after the committing of the offences calls for a considerable measure of understanding and flexibility of approach - passage of time between offence and sentence, when lengthy, will often lead to considerations of fairness to the prisoner in his present situation playing a dominant role in the determination of what should be done in the matter of sentence; at times this can require what might otherwise be a quite undue degree of leniency being extended to the prisoner"". 
         
        
       
     112    Factors that have often been said to be relevant are the rehabilitation, if any, and the record and conduct of the offender during the extended delay and him being in a state of uncertain suspense as to what will happen to him when he comes up for sentence. 
      
       
     113    In the present case two aspects of delay require consideration, namely the delay from the offence in 1974 to December 1996 when the complainant went to the police or perhaps January 1997 when the police spoke to the appellant and from January 1997 until March 2000 when the trial was held, that is, the delay in bringing the offender to trial. 
      
       
     114    In R v Holyoak, (1995) 82 A Crim R 502 Allen J said that whether a lengthy delay between the date of commission of the offences and the date of conviction was a detriment suffered by the applicant depended upon the circumstances of the case. He pointed to the two extremes, namely the offender who waits appalled at what he has done, an emotional wreck fearful that at any time the police will come and the offender untroubled by his offences, lacking any remorse and confident that they will never come to light because the victim will never talk about them and enjoying unwarranted acceptance in his respectable and stable lifestyle. 
      
       
     115    In R v Dennis, (unreported CCA 14 December 1992) James J speaking for the Court and following what the Court had said in DJM, (unreported, CCA 13 August 1992 per Badgery-Parker J) stated: 
      
       
        
         
         ""It is not infrequently the case that sexual offences committed against a child of which only the offender and the child have knowledge, are first revealed by the child to a third person only years afterwards when the child has attained a certain level of maturity. In such cases the mere passage of time between the committing of the offences and the disclosure of the offences and the apprehension of the offender is of little weight as a factor in mitigation of penalty"". 
         
        
       
     116    In DJM Badgery-Parker J commented that the delay overall from the commission of the last of the offences in 1983 to sentencing in 1992 was extraordinary. He attached particular importance to the delay between the time when the offences came to notice in 1987 and the sentencing in 1992. He thought that the delay presented real problems to the sentencing judge. 
      
       
     117    In the present case the sentencing judge referred to these authorities. He thought that the case did not fit within either of the extremes outlined by Allen J in Holyoak. The judge found that the applicant went on for years confidently believing that his crime would not be reported. The judge pointed out that one of the applicant's brothers, as well as the victim was aware of the crime. The family kept quiet so that the revival and reporting of the matter must have come as a surprise. The judge thought that the evidence of the brother may have been a significant factor in the jury reaching its conclusion. 
      
       
     118    The judge decided that some discount must be given for the delay in the revelation of the offence, although possibly not as great a discount as would have been the case if others had not known of the offences and kept quiet about them. The materials reveal that the applicant assisted his younger siblings when his mother neglected them because of a lesbian relationship into which she entered. At one point relations between the applicant and his sister were good. 
      
       
     119    The delay between 1997 and 2000 was explained in part by there having been an aborted trial. This would have increased the pressures on the applicant especially as he was struggling to care for his wife who was seriously ill and suffering much pain. The judge took into account that the applicant would serve any sentence in protection where the conditions of imprisonment are more severe. 
      
       
     120    The judge found that the needs of the applicant's wife brought the case within the range of circumstances that could truly be described as exceptional. He found that the imprisonment of the applicant would impose exceptional hardship on his family. 
      
       
     121    Having considered the question of sentence at some length I am persuaded that the judge did not err. I am further persuaded that the judge imposed a very lenient sentence and that he could not reasonably have imposed a lesser sentence. 
      
       
     122    Leave to appeal against the sentence should be granted but the appeal should be dismissed.

      JUDGMENT 
      1   WOOD CJ AT CL: The applicant seeks leave to appeal from a sentence of imprisonment for ten years and six months with a non parole period of seven years and eleven months, imposed upon him for the offence of supplying 2.1 kgs of heroin, being an amount just over twice the large commercial quantity applicable to that substance. That is an offence for which the maximum available penalty is one of imprisonment for life: S 25(2) Drug Misuse & Trafficking Act 1985. 
     2   The applicant was, at the same time, sentenced for two counts of supplying two samples of heroin, respectively in amounts of 0.38 grams and 0.19 grams, and for one count of supplying 0.2 grams of methylamphetamine. In respect of these two further heroin offences, concurrent terms of imprisonment for three years with non-parole periods for two years and three months were imposed. For the methylamphetamine offence, a concurrent fixed term of one year was imposed. In respect of that matter, a further offence of possession of 0.14 grams of that substance was taken into account on a form 1. 
     3   The offences were detected during a targeted NCA operation, and involved a somewhat sophisticated and well organised criminal venture on the part of those involved. It is common ground that the offender occupying the highest rung in the distribution chain was a person Cuong, known by the honorific “Uncle”. It was he who initially held the drugs, and it was from him that the others took instructions. However both the applicant and a co-offender Nguyen were significantly involved in the operation, being persons described by his Honour as ""secondary principals"". This was a term of somewhat uncertain meaning and of dubious value. However, it can be taken to mean that these two offenders were the persons entrusted with authority to arrange the sale of drugs and to effect their delivery once a sale had been negotiated. 
     4   In the case of the applicant, his involvement began in Melbourne, where he met a covert operative Alex on 4 April 2000, and offered to him six blocks of heroin each of 12.5 ounces for sale in Sydney. A price of $51,000 per block was negotiated between the applicant and Alex. Arrangements were made for a meeting in Sydney. That meeting took place at the Star City Casino on 12 April 2000. It was attended by the applicant, by Alex and by another covert operative, Dat. 
     5   On this occasion Alex and Dat showed the applicant $200,000 in bank notes in a sports bag. The applicant gave to Alex three paper packets containing the two small quantities of heroin (one being white in colour and one beige), and the small quantity of methylamphetamine, which were respectively the subject of the three lesser supply charges. They were offered as samples, the applicant asking Alex what kind of heroin he preferred, and also indicating that he could supply “ice”, or methylamphetamine, of good quality at the price of a $120,000 per kilo. Arrangements were made for a further meeting on the following day. 
     6   On the afternoon of 13 April Alex met the applicant and a co-offender Nguyen in Ultimo. They were joined by Dat who was carrying $306,000 as show money in the boot of his vehicle. After some discussion the applicant, Nguyen and Alex drove to a block of home units in Illawarra Road Marrickville. They were followed by Dat in his vehicle. Further discussions took place at those premises concerning the arrangements for the exchange of the heroin and the money. 
     7   At this point Alex and Dat changed their roles, Alex remaining in Dat's vehicle with the money, while Dat went with the applicant and Nguyen to a unit inside the Illawarra Road building. Dat was there introduced to another person, Le, with whom further discussion took place in relation to the way in which the exchange would be effected. 
     8   Le indicated that the transaction would take place at another location. She then walked with Dat to Ewart Street in Dulwich Hill where they were both picked up by an Asian male driving a motor vehicle registered to Le. 
     9   The driver of this vehicle then took them a short distance down Ewart Street before stopping at another block of home units. Le drove off leaving Dat and the Asian driver behind. On their way into the building they were met by an unidentified Asian male and an Asian female in the courtyard. The former handed a shopping bag to the driver, and then left with the female. Dat and the driver went into unit 13, where Dat was given the shopping bag which upon inspection was found to contain three packages each containing two blocks of heroin. 
     10   Dat contacted Alex by mobile phone to confirm that he had received the heroin, and also to make arrangements to bring the money to the unit. In the meantime, Alex, the applicant and Nguyen had remained together at Marrickville in or near the vehicle which contained the money. 
     11   During this period, Nguyen had engaged in a number of conversations by mobile phone with Le, whom he referred to as “Aunt Phuong” and with the driver of the motor vehicle. 
     12   After the call from Dat was received, the money was counted and Nguyen confirmed with the driver of Le's vehicle, whom he addressed as “Uncle”, that the money was correct. 
     13   Nguyen then directed Alex to drive to Ewart Street. When they arrived there Nguyen left the vehicle and went into the unit where Dat was waiting. The applicant and Alex waited outside for them. They were, at this point, arrested and the bag containing the $306,000 was recovered. When Nguyen and Dat left the unit carrying the shopping bag, with its heroin packages, they were also arrested as was Le a short time later. 
     14   The arrests of Alex and Dat were naturally enough show arrests. When the applicant was interviewed, he admitted his involvement in the supply offences. Examination of his personal property turned up the residual quantity of methylamphetamine which gave rise to the offence included in the Form 1. 
     15   Nguyen, it may be observed, declined to be interviewed at this stage. 
     16   The estimated street value of the 2.1 kgs of heroin, which upon analysis was found to constitute 893 grams of pure heroin, was about $2.1 million. 
     17   Both the applicant and Nguyen pleaded guilty, and were sentenced by his Honour Woods DCJ in the District Court. The sentence imposed upon Nguyen for the single offence of which he was convicted, namely the supply of the 2.1 kgs of heroin was one of seven and a half years with a non parole period of four years. 
     18   At the time of the offence the applicant was aged about 30 years, and had a prior criminal history including several convictions in Victoria for offences of burglary, theft, and breaches of community based orders. He also had convictions for a number of offences of dishonesty involving the obtaining of financial advantage by deception, obtaining property by deception and making false documents. These had been dealt with on 11 November 1999, and had led to a total sentence of 12 months imprisonment, of which 10 months had been suspended. He came from a good family, but experienced the significant difficulty and hardship associated with his experience when, after escaping from Vietnam with his father and brother in 1980, he had lived for two months or so in a refugee camp in Malaysia, before gaining entry into Australia. 
     19   Once in this country he completed his Higher School Certificate, and entered the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology before abandoning his tertiary studies to embark upon a business career in the area of loan finance. 
     20   He married in 1993, but later separated from his wife in about 1997. He did not become involved in delinquent behaviour or drug abuse in his teens, but began to use drugs after the breakdown of his marriage. There was some evidence of him having been hospitalised at one time in 1999, after an episode of drug induced psychosis, and of suffering some degree of depression associated with his business difficulties. 
     21   In a letter addressed to the Court he expressed contrition and an intention to abstain from drug abuse. That letter was however significantly self-serving so far as it sought to minimise his criminality, and it does not suggest that he has much by the way of insight into the seriousness of his involvement in the drug trade at a commercial level. 
     22   Nguyen was a 19 year old at the time of the offence. He had been living in Australia on a student visa and had a lesser criminal history although it included convictions for drug related offences. In his case, the evidence showed that he had been dislocated from his family, had a limited command of the English language, and was drug dependent. He was assessed by his Honour to have been “vulnerable”, and his youth was something which, it was said was a matter “which very greatly distinguished him from his co-offender”. 
     23   In the case of the applicant special circumstances were expressly not found. In the case of Nguyen, while his Honour did not expressly deal with the question, it is evident from the sentencing order, which involved a non-parole period of the order of 53 percent of the head sentence, that they were found to exist. Properly would that been so, having regard to his age, his background and his lack of family and community ties, which did require that there be a significant period of post release supervision. 
     24   Four grounds were argued in support of the application. 
      
       
      Finding that the role of the applicant was that of a ""secondary principal"" 
       
     25   As I have observed the expression ""secondary principal"" is somewhat ambiguous, and so far as it may have been used to reflect a measure of the objective seriousness of the applicant's criminality by reference to some arbitrary classification of those involved in the drug distribution chain, then it was unhelpful. More relevant was the assessment of the part actually played by the applicant so far as that could be discerned. See Olbrich (1999) 73 ALJR 1550 and Wong and Leung (1999) 108 A Crim R 531. 
     26   In this regard it is clear that the applicant was working in close association with the person known as ""Uncle"", the man who was holding the heroin and to whom the others deferred. It is also clear that he occupied a significant role in a well organised and sophisticated operation for the supply of drugs in a quantity, and in circumstances, which were only consistent with its ocurrence at a wholesale and not a street level. The number of persons used, the steps taken to avoid detection, and the awareness of those involved as to the risks which they were undertaking attests to that fact. Moreover, it was the applicant who conducted negotiations with a prospective buyer, and who offered ongoing supply. 
     27   To the extent that a submission was made that the applicant was ""big noting"" himself, and was merely a pawn in the operation, there was no support whatsoever in my view for that proposition. 
     28   The evidence concerning the circumstances in which the sale was negotiated in Melbourne, the applicant's conduct in supplying samples associated with his enquiry as to the type of heroin which Alex preferred, and his supply of the 2.1 kgs of this substance revealed the contrary. This submission has no substance. 
      
       
      Finding that the applicant was at the same level of involvement as Nguyen 
       
     29   In essence this submission involved a parity argument, in which it was contended that, upon the evidence, Nguyen stood at a higher level in the distribution chain than the applicant, and that as a consequence he is entitled to have a justifiable sense of grievance by reason of the heavier sentence which he received. 
     30   Upon the evidence there is no basis whatsoever for attributing any higher level of involvement to Nguyen. In fact there is good reason to find that Nguyen's involvement began only after the negotiation of the sale, and was more related to the implementation, or delivery stage of the transaction. Otherwise there was good reason for distinguishing between them for the purpose of sentence, having regard to the differences in their ages, in their family circumstances, in their criminal antecedents, and in the fact that the applicant was being sentenced for four offences while Nguyen was being sentenced for one. 
     31   It is clear that his Honour sentenced the applicant upon the basis of the total criminality involved, regarding the other two heroin supply offences as intrinsically bound up with the relevant offence. The distinguishing features noted establish that there was no occasion for the applicant maintaining a legitimate sense of grievance as that expression has been explained in Lowe (1984) 154 CLR 606, and Postiglione (1997) 71 ALJR 875. This submission is also without merit. 
     32   The starting point of the sentence 
     33   It was next submitted that his Honour erred in proceeding upon the basis that but for the plea of guilty, the appropriate starting point for the applicant was one of 14 years, which was then discounted by 25 per cent for the plea of guilty and contrition. 
     34   In this regard our attention has been drawn to the Judicial Commission statistics, and in particular to the fact that for a similar offence during the period which they cover, that is April 1993 to March 2000, no offender has received more than ten years following a plea of guilty, and that no offender has received a minimum term in excess of seven years. 
     35   Those statistics however reveal that 20 per cent of the offenders sampled did receive a full term in the order of ten years, and 25 per cent received a minimum term in the order of seven years. 
     36   The difficulty with statistics relates to the fact that unless the sample is large they can be quite misleading. In the present case, the sample size is very small being confined to sixteen cases. As a consequence they were of limited value. As has also been pointed out on many occasions, there are infinite differences in the subjective and objective circumstances of offenders which can be concealed within the statistics, as well a different quantities of drugs falling within a relevant range. 
     37   It is for this reason that they provide a guide which while helpful, is to be used with a considerable degree of caution. 
     38   A submission was advanced by senior counsel for the applicant, in the written submissions, to the effect that his Honour may have fallen into error in applying the guideline in Wong & Leung to a State offence. There is, however, no suggestion in the reasons for sentence that his Honour took that course, or if he did that he failed to understand the difference between Federal and State drug offences. I see no reason to speculate in that regard. 
     39   The question for this Court ultimately is whether the starting point, when considered against the maximum available sentence, and in the light of the objective and subjective circumstances, was too high. I am not persuaded that it was. Certainly it was at the top of the range, and was a heavy sentence. However the fact remains that trafficking in a large commercial quantity of drugs, in the course of an operation which is as sophisticated as that seen in this case, is an offence for which condign sentences are expected both by way of punishment and in the interests of specific and general deterrence. See Pilley (1991) 56 A Crim R 202 and Chan (1999) NSWCCA 103.  
     40   No greater threat is posed to the community, and to its young, than that which is presented by those who stoop to engage in this evil trade. Inevitably such offenders are selfishly heedless of the disastrous consequences which narcotics have for the law and order and health budgets for those who fall into their snare as users, and for their families, who suffer the despair and anxiety associated with the inevitable degradation which follows. 
     41   The stakes in the drug trade are high, but so are the risks. Any person who seeks to enter into this trade must accept those risks which inevitably include the fate of a heavy sentence of imprisonment if caught.  
     42   While there is no evidence, in the present case, as to precisely what financial reward the applicant expected from his role, it is clear that he was not doing it without the expectation of some reward either monetary or in kind. As such he is disentitled to any clemency beyond that evidenced by his plea and his contrition. 
     43   Moreover, the fact that the supply was to undercover operatives, in circumstances where it is perfectly clear that the applicant would have committed the offence, even without their encouragement, does not operate in mitigation of sentence. See Lackany NSWCCA 1 December 1992. 
     44   I am accordingly not persuaded that his Honour fell into error in relation to the starting point. 
      
       
      Applicant's drug use 
       
     45   It was finally submitted that his Honour fell into error so far as he found that while the applicant had been a drug user in the past, he then dismissed its relevance upon the basis that it was a past use. There was indeed evidence that the applicant had been, and was using drugs, but it is not a fair reading of the reasons for sentence to conclude that its relevance was dismissed upon the basis that he had no current habit. His Honour in fact said, ""The fact that he has been a drug user in the past would be a significant factor if he was a person offending at street level."" 
     46   This was an observation that was entirely correct, and it was well supported by authority. In the case of the street level user/dealer there is room for a measure of clemency. That consideration does not, however, apply to a principal or an offender operating at the level at which the applicant operated in the hierarchy of a drug supply operation, see Bernath (1997) 1 VR 271. This submission is also not made good. However.  
     47   I would accordingly grant leave to appeal, but I would dismiss the appeal. 
     48   SPERLING J: I agree. 
     49   WOODS: The order of the Court will be as I have proposed.

       Paul Henry JOHNSON v Judge PHELAN and DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS (NSW) 
       
       
       
      The claimant, a litigant in person, seeks an order directing Judge Phelan to state a case for the Court of Criminal Appeal with respect to his District Court criminal proceedings. The offences for which the claimant was convicted in the District Court arose out of a Community Service Order issued in 1996, and the claimant’s arrest in 1997 for an alleged breach of such. The claimant submitted to the Court that as the Community Service Order had expired more than one month prior to his arrest, the execution of the warrant for his arrest was unlawful. The major issue in the appeal was the meaning of the word ‘proceedings’ in s 23 of the  
      Community Service Orders Act  
      1979.  
       
       
      Per Priestley, Meagher and Stein JJA: 
       
       
      1) The phrase ‘proceedings for an offence’ as found in s 23 of the  
      Community Service Orders Act  
      1979 does not refer to the actual arrest, but to the laying of the information for breach of the Community Service Order.

       Paul Henry JOHNSON v Judge PHELAN and DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS (NSW) 
       
       
       JUDGMENT 
       
       
     1    PRIESTLEY JA: I agree with Stein JA. 
     2    MEAGHER JA: I agree with Stein JA.3    STEIN JA: The claimant, Paul Henry Johnson, a litigant in person, seeks an order directing Judge Phelan, the first opponent, to state a case to the Court of Criminal Appeal with respect to the claimant’s District Court criminal appeal proceedings. The second opponent is the Director of Public Prosecutions (the DPP). 4    In order to understand the submissions, it is necessary to set out some of the background of the matter. On 28 March 1996 the claimant was convicted in Wollongong Local Court for ‘drive manner dangerous’. A Community Service Order of 200 hours was imposed, and he was disqualified from driving for 3 years. The claimant was also convicted on that date of ‘malicious damage’, the sentence for which was deferred under the then s 558 of the Crimes Act 1900. The claimant entered a self- recognizance in the amount of $300, to be of good behaviour for two years. The recognizance was conditioned upon his accepting the supervision and guidance of the Probation and Parole Service for such period as deemed necessary. The claimant was also ordered to pay compensation in the sum of $2,226.19 to the Police Department within twelve months.5    On 25 September 1996 an information was laid at the Wollongong Local Court by Rhonda Freestone of the Probation and Parole Service. Within its heading, the document refers to s 23 of Act 192 of 1979 (the Community Service Orders Act 1979). The information alleged that the claimant had ‘failed without reasonable cause or excuse to comply with any requirement made by the Community Service Orders Act’. The information stated that the reason for his failure to comply was a ‘Reluctance To Finish The Work Assigned To Him & Unsuitability To Continue Work Order Due to Undocumented Medical Condition & Aggressive Attitude Towards Work Placements And The Conditions Of This Order’. The information continued to the effect that a Justice should proceed to issue a warrant for the claimant’s apprehension. 
     6    On the same day the informant sought and obtained the issue of a warrant for the apprehension of the claimant in order to bring him before a Magistrate to answer the allegation that he breached the CSO. 
     7    A further information was laid at the Wollongong Local Court on 14 October 1996 by William Bourke of the Probation and Parole Service. It alleged that the claimant had ‘failed to comply with a condition of the said recognizance, in that: Failed to keep an appointment on 24.6.96. Not complying with CSO. Present whereabouts unknown.’ The document continued: 
      
       
        
        AND I the undersigned Magistrate being satisfied by the information on oath that the said offender has failed to observe the condition of the recognizance: These are therefore to command you in Her majesty’s name forthwith to apprehend and bring to said offender before the Court to be further dealt with according to law. 
        
       
     8    On 13 August 1997, after receiving information that the claimant had returned to the area and was living in his car at Wombarra, police went to the area. They informed the claimant of the existence of the warrants and of their intention to arrest him. After what the second opponent describes as a ‘stand off’, the claimant walked away from the police.  
     9    On 15 August 1997, two police officers again went to Wombarra with the intention of arresting the claimant. Phelan DCJ, during the hearing of the appeals, found that the claimant was abusive towards the police from the outset, and that the claimant then ‘picked up a large stick from the ground and lifted it in a threatening manner… He began to walk towards Senior Constable Baird who had to retreat. He then approached the other officer with a stick held over his head… The [claimant] then picked up a steering lock which he held in one hand and a stick in the other. He said, “Come near me and I will kill you”. He then went into the nearby cemetery. A subsequent search failed to locate him’. 10    On 18 August 1997 police returned to Wombarra to arrest the claimant. According to police he was informed that he was under arrest under two outstanding warrants, and was asked to put down the stick he was holding. He ran from the police and hid within the cemetery, and when located he threatened the police by swinging the stick at them. He was then tackled, at which time be struggled violently, kicking and punching at the arresting officers. He was eventually subdued and taken to Wollongong Police Station where he was charged. When being transferred into the custody of Corrective Services, he refused to submit to a strip search and became aggressive. He allegedly spat at one of the Corrective Services Officers, striking him in the eye and mouth area. 11    The claimant was charged with common assault with respect to the Corrective Services Officer, with two counts of ‘assault police’ with respect to the events of 15 August 1997, and with assaulting police and resisting arrest on 18 August 1997.  
     12    On 14 October 1997, the claimant was before the Local Court with respect to the alleged breaches of the Community Service Order and recognizance. However, the Magistrate directed that no action be taken with regard to the alleged breaches of the Order and recognizance. The power of the Court to take no action is derived from s 25(1)(d) of the Community Service Orders Act (the Act) by reason of the expiry of the Order. 
     13    At the hearing of the summons, the claimant was under the impression that the Magistrate said that because the CSO had expired, the order was automatically revoked, therefore there was no breach of the CSO and the claimant was found not guilty. However, this was from the Claimant’s memory only without the benefit of the transcript.14    Once the transcript was obtained by the DPP, it became clear that the Claimant’s recollection was incorrect. The Magistrate in fact said ‘Order expired 27 March 1997. No action taken to revoke order’. He did not find that the Claimant had not breached the CSO. Indeed, it appears that he said to the Claimant: 
      
       
        
        So in effect Mr Johnson what’s happened is, you’ve got away with doing sixty and a quarter hours instead of 200. That’s the end of the Community Service Order matter. 
        
       
      15    On 23 July 1998 Mr Lyon, Magistrate convicted the claimant of common assault and imposed a fine of $750. The claimant appealed to the District Court. Mr Still, Magistrate convicted the claimant of two counts of ‘assault police’ on 13 October 1998 and imposed s 558 recognizances in the sum of $500 to be of good behaviour for two years and accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service. The claimant appealed to the District Court. On 14 October 1998 Mr Maloney, Magistrate convicted the claimant of ‘resist arrest’ and ‘assault police’ and imposed two further recognizances in the sum of $500 to be of good behaviour for 12 months. The claimant appealed to the District Court. 
     16    All of the claimant’s appeals to the District Court were heard over several days in 1999 and 2000 by Judge Phelan. He reserved his decision in all matters and judgment was given on 19 October 2000. The claimant achieved a modicum of success. With respect to the conviction for common assault, his Honour found the offence proven but ordered that no conviction be recorded, and dismissed the appeal. Appeals were upheld and the convictions quashed with respect to five charges of assault police, assault special constable and resist arrest. On the remaining charges of assaulting police and resisting arrest, his Honour dismissed the appeals, and found the offences proven. Convictions were recorded but in lieu of the sentences imposed by the Local Courts, the claimant was to enter into a good behaviour bond for a period of 12 months for each offence. 17    After convictions were recorded by Phelan DCJ the claimant indicated that he wished to appeal. He maintains that his Honour indicated to him that the only way to do so was to ask him to state case to the Court of Criminal Appeal. The transcript does not indicate that such a conversation, in the terms claimed, took place. In any event, the claimant lodged a document seeking that a case be stated by his Honour on 14 November 2000, and was advised of Phelan DCJ’s response that the District Court was functus officio and accordingly a case could not be stated. The claimant then filed a summons in the Court of Appeal on 21 February 2001. The second opponent was joined into the summons on 15 March 2001, and was represented at the hearing by Ms Langley. The first opponent filed a submitting appearance.18    The hearing concentrated upon the claimant’s submission that the execution of the warrants for his arrest was unlawful. He referred the court to s 23 of the Act which provides:  
      
       
        
        (1) If a person in respect of whom a community service order is in force fails, without reasonable cause or excuse, to comply with the order or with any requirement made by or under this Act or the regulations in respect of the order, the person shall be guilty of an offence. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Proceedings for an offence under subsection (1) in respect of a community service order shall be brought in accordance with section 24. 
         
         
        (3) Notwithstanding section 56(1) of the Justices Act 1902 proceedings for an offence under subsection (1) in respect of a community service order shall not be commenced at any time later than one month after the order ceased to be in force. 
        
       
     19    It is convenient also to set out s 24 of the Act. 
      
       
        
        If it appears on complaint in writing to a justice that a person in respect of whom a community service order is in force has failed, without reasonable cause or excuse, to comply with the order or with any requirement made by or under this Act or the regulations in respect of the order, the justice may issue a summons requiring the person to appear before the supervising court at the time specified in the summons or may, if the complaint is in writing and on oath, issue a warrant for the arrest of the person and directing that the person be brought before the supervising court as soon as possible after the person’s arrest. 
        
       
     20    The claimant argued that as the relevant community service order had expired on 27 March 1997, by virtue of s 16(2)(a) of the Act, and since his arrest on 18 August 1997 was some three and half months outside of the one month period referred to in s 23(3), it was unlawful. He submitted to the court that the ‘proceedings’ referred to in s 23 were his arrest, and therefore the execution of the warrants was unlawful as being out of time. This would obviously have implications for his convictions for resisting arrest and assaulting police.21    On behalf of the DPP, Ms Langley submitted that when read as a whole, and with reference to s 24, the legislature intended that ‘proceedings’ would refer not to the actual arrest of the claimant, but to the laying of the information for breach of the Community Service Order and issue of a warrant for arrest. The laying of the informations and issue of warrants for arrest occurred on 25 September and 14 October 1996 respectively, at which time the Community Service Order was still in force. The proceeding was thereby appropriate and lawful under the Act. 
     22    The point of commencement of criminal proceedings was discussed in R v Hull (1989) 16 NSWLR 385, a matter in which a similar provision to s 23(3) of the Act was at issue. Gleeson CJ said that criminal proceedings ordinarily commence when one of three courses of action, or methods, are undertaken. He described these at 390 as being: 
      
       
        
        In serious cases it is common for the proceedings to be commenced by arrests without warrant. A person who has been arrested must be taken before a magistrate without delay. The arrested person may be questioned and then charged. A second method involves the issue by a justice of a warrant for the arrest of a person where an information has been sworn before a justice. Such an information, which is usually laid by a police officer or other law enforcement official, will then result in an issue of a warrant. A third method, which can be used whether the offence in question is indictable or summary, involves the issue by a justice of a summons requiring the appearance in court of the person named in the information. The summons sets out the offence that the person in question is alleged to have committed and requires the person to attend court to answer the allegation.  
        
       
       
      Grove and Studdert JJ agreed. See also  
      Allerton v DPP 
       (1991) 24 NSWLR 550 at 557. 
       
     23    Here the proceedings were commenced by the second method described by Gleeson CJ. The informations were laid before Justices by members of the Probation and Parole Service, and warrants were issued as a result. It was these actions, not the arrest of the claimant, which constituted the ‘proceedings for an offence’ under s 23 of the Act. It is plain that the procedure followed was in accordance with the requirements of s 24 of the Act.24    Although the claimant is quite certain that his interpretation of s 23 is correct, his construction is plainly wrong. In any event, it is not apparent that the claimant’s contentions, assuming them to be correct, run to the information and warrant of 14 October 1996 regarding the alleged breach of the recognizance under s 558 of the Crimes Act 1900.  
     25    As a result, it is not necessary to consider the DPP’s contention that since Phelan DCJ had made final orders, he no longer had jurisdiction to state a case. However, this submission also appears to be correct in light of Elliot v Williams (1985) 15 A Crim R 437 and DPP v Cassell (1995) 80 A Crim R 160. 
     26    Accordingly, the summons of the claimant should be dismissed.

    - 5 -IN THE COURT OFCRIMINAL APPEALMonday 13 August 2001WOOD CJ at CLSPERLING J 60127/01 Regina v Steven Park Judgment 1    SPERLING J: On 25 December 1999 the applicant lost control of the vehicle he was driving. The vehicle collided with another vehicle and then with a tree. Two passengers in the appellant's vehicle were injured. 
      
       
        
       
     2    The applicant was charged with two offences under s 52A(3) of the Crimes Act 1900, one charge in respect of each of the persons injured. The charge, in each case, was that the vehicle driven by the applicant was involved in an impact occasioning grievous bodily harm, and that the applicant was, at the time of the impact, driving the vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor. The maximum penalty for an offence under s52A(3) is imprisonment for seven years. 
      
       
        
       
     3    The applicant pleaded guilty to each charge. 
      
       
        
       
     4    The applicant's speed was not substantially over the limit for the area, but he had been drinking and was plainly intoxicated. According to the police officer's evidence concerning the applicant's apparent condition at the scene of the accident, the applicant's eyes were glazed and blood shot, he was uncoordinated and his breath smelt strongly of alcohol. When interviewed by the police, the applicant described his condition as being ""fairly drunk"". When giving evidence at the sentencing hearing he agreed, in cross-examination, that when he got into the car he ""felt drunk"". Asked whether he considered, at that time, that he should not drive, his answer was, ""Just the spirit of the moment with my friends.""  
      
       
        
       
     5    The appellant's blood alcohol level at the time of the event was not less than 0.148 and not more than 0.170 grams of alcohol per 100 ml of blood. Within that range, all persons would be under the influence of intoxicating liquor to the extent that there would be impairment of driving ability. That was the uncontradicted expert evidence. 
      
       
        
       
     6    There is some suggestion, on the material before this Court, that two further offences were taken into account on Form 1. However, there is no reference to any such offences in the remarks on sentence, and it appears that the offences referred to were “back up” charges with which the Crown has not proceeded. Accordingly, I put that aspect of the matter out of account.  
      
       
        
       
     7    The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for two years with a non-parole period of one year.  
      
       
        
       
     8    The following guidelines were promulgated in Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 231 so far as is material. 
      
       
        
         
          
          (1) A non-custodial sentence for an offence against s 52A should be exceptional and almost invariably confined to cases of momentary inattention or mis-judgment. 
          
         
         
          
          (2) With a plea of guilty, wherever there is present to a material degree any aggravating factor involving the conduct of the offender, the custodial sentence (minimum plus additional or fixed term) of ….. less than two years (in the case of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm) should be exceptional. 
          
         
        
       
     The Chief Justice referred to degree of intoxication as an aggravating factor for the purpose of guideline (2). The degree of intoxication, he said, may indicate that the offender abandoned responsibility for his conduct, in which case that factor could be said to be present to a material degree. 
      
       
        
       
     9    The sentencing judge found that the degree of intoxication in the present case indicated that the applicant had abandoned responsibility for his conduct. That finding was not challenged here and could not have been. 
      
       
        
       
     10    Accordingly, the sentencing judge was correct in treating Jurisic guideline (2) as applicable. 
      
       
        
       
     11    The applicant does not submit that there was any error in the factual findings made by the trial judge. It is submitted, however, that his Honour failed to give sufficient weight to subjective factors, and, in particular, that this would be the applicant's first time in prison. 
      
       
        
       
     12    It was also submitted that his Honour had failed to take into account that the passengers were not innocent bystanders, but had entered the applicant's vehicle apparently in full knowledge of the applicant's condition. 
      
       
        
       
     13    There were very strong subjective factors in favour of the applicant in this case, but it is not exceptional that this offence is committed by young men of otherwise unblemished character. That this would be the applicant's first time in prison is not exceptional for this offence. That those injured had, or may have had full knowledge of the applicant's condition is not exceptional. These considerations in combination are not exceptional. 
      
       
        
       
     14    The Crown submitted that there was no evidence to support a finding that the injured persons were fully aware of the applicant's condition and that, if they were, that is an irrelevant consideration. It is unnecessary to decide those issues because, as I have said, such a consideration alone or in combination with other factors does not make this case exceptional. 
      
       
        
       
     15    The sentence of two years imprisonment was as lenient as a sentence could have been, conformably with the guidelines in Jurisic. 
      
       
        
       
     16    The non-parole period of one year represented a generous reduction for special circumstances relative to the provisional statutory formula. There was no error in the exercise of the judge's discretion in not being more generous in that regard than he was. 
      
       
        
       
     17    I would grant leave to appeal in this case, but would dismiss the appeal. In doing so I would draw attention to the last sentence in his Honour's remarks on sentence in which his Honour said that he recommended the applicant's release at the expiration of the non-parole period. His Honour should have directed release at that time which will be the applicant's entitlement in view of the duration of the sentence. 
      
       
        
       
     18    WOOD CJ at CL: I agree. The order of the Court will be as Sperling J has proposed, varying so much of the sentencing order in terms of the recommendation. It will be replaced by an order directing the appellant’s release at the expiration of the of the non-parole period.

     60626/00 Regina v DBJUDGMENT1    WOOD CJ at CL: I ask Sperling J to deliver the first judgment in this matter. 
      
       
        
       
     2    SPERLING J: The applicant was sentenced in the District Court on 30 June 2000, having pleaded guilty to one count of homosexual intercourse with a person under the age of ten years (Crimes Act 1900, s 78H) and one count of assault and commit an act of indecency on a person under the age of ten years (Crimes Act 1900, s 61M(2)). The maximum penalty for an offence under s 78H is imprisonment for twenty-five years, and under s 61M(2) imprisonment for ten years. 
      
       
        
       
     3    The offence under s 78H consisted of fellatio on the applicant's grandson when the child was seven years of age. The offence under s 61M(2) consisted of fondling the same child's penis when he was five years of age. 
      
       
        
       
     4    The sentencing judge took into account two further offences under s 78H and five further offences under s 61M(2) on Form 1. These consisted of two similar further offences under s 78H on the same child and five similar further offences under s 61M(2) of which two were on the same child and three were on the child's brother. The offences were committed over a period of about two and a half years.  
      
       
        
       
     5    The effective sentence imposed by the sentencing judge for these offences was imprisonment for five years commencing on 30 June 2000, with a non-parole period of two and a half years. The applicant was seventy-one years of age when sentenced and was in poor health. 
      
       
        
       
     6    On behalf of the applicant it was acknowledged that the offences were serious and that they involved a significant breach of trust in relation to very young children. It was further submitted that there were powerful objective considerations relating to the applicant which made the sentence manifestly excessive. These were specified as follows, in the applicant's written submissions: 
      
       
        
         
          
          (a) his age - he was seventy-one at the time of sentence; 
          
         
         
          
          (b) his previously unblemished character; 
          
         
         
          
          (c) his poor health - he had undergone open heart surgery in the period prior to sentence; 
          
         
         
          
          (d) his immediate admissions to his son to having committed the offences when he was first confronted with the allegations; 
          
         
         
          
          (e) his pleas of guilty which were entered at the first available opportunity spared the victims the ordeal of having to give evidence; 
          
         
         
          
          (f) his contrition and remorse; 
          
         
         
          
          (g) the fact that the sentence was likely to be served under protection; 
          
         
         
          
          (h) the fact that the applicant did not represent a risk of re-offending and accordingly had good prospects of rehabilitation; 
          
         
         
          
          (i) the fact that he must live with the realisation that his behaviour has led to the destruction of the family unit with the result that he is estranged from his own sons as well as his grandsons. 
          
         
        
       
     7    After he was sentenced, the applicant was diagnosed with prostate cancer. The condition was probably in existence when the applicant was sentenced. It was common ground that, in these circumstances, the applicant was entitled to a fresh determination of the appropriate sentence by this Court, without the need to demonstrate that the existing sentence was excessive on the evidence before the sentencing judge: Smith (1987) 44 SASR 587; Spagnolo (2000) 114 ACrimR 98; Burrell (2000) 114 ACrimR 207) 
      
       
        
       
     8    Notwithstanding the nature of the offences committed by the applicant the Court is bound to have regard, in mitigation of penalty, to the applicant being otherwise of good character: Ryan [2001] HCA 21. 
      
       
        
       
     9    The applicant was, at the relevant time, a medical practitioner. Witnesses called as to the applicant's good character, included Mr Peter Hastie, a Presbyterian minister, who described the applicant as being: 
      
       
        
         
          
          ""A person of unimpeachable character ... [who] is widely regarded in the local community ... as being a very professional and very reliable general practitioner. There are a number of people in [his] congregation who ... owe their lives to him because of his diagnostic abilities."" 
          
         
         
        Mr Hastie listed a number of occasions and events which justified his conclusion that the applicant ""was generous with his time, with his possessions and also with his hospitality"". 
         
        
       
     10    Mr Bruce Smythe, who had known the applicant for fifty years and who had experience as a counsellor, lecturer and in the Christian ministry, also spoke of the applicant's generosity, kindness and integrity. Notwithstanding his surprise and concern at what the applicant had done, he said he continued to ""esteem him as a friend"". He said that he gave evidence on the applicant's behalf because he felt that ""it is important that the Court makes its decision on the widest knowledge of the man"". 
      
       
        
       
     11    A former neighbour, Mr James Conomos, described the applicant as ""an exceptional man"". 
      
       
        
       
     12    The applicant is entitled to a discount for early plea. The pleas of guilty also qualify as part of a course of conduct showing contrition and remorse on the part of the applicant. 
      
       
        
       
     13    The applicant immediately admitted, when confronted by his son, that he had interfered with his grandsons. He sent his son a letter that contained material which constituted admissions. He also apologised to his daughter-in-law for his behaviour as well as writing to his grandsons to express his regret about his actions. 
      
       
        
       
     14    The applicant thereafter entered pleas of guilty at the earliest opportunity. This spared his grandsons the ordeal of giving evidence, an experience the applicant was most anxious for them to avoid. Indeed, he told the Court of his concerns about the potential for ""gross psychological damage"" to them should they have to give evidence. 
      
       
        
       
     15    I would allow a discount of 20 per cent for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty. 
      
       
        
         
        
       
     16    The applicant did not have to admit the allegations. There is the possibility in a case such as this that the evidence of young children might not be accepted by a jury. By confessing to the offences the applicant gave up a chance of acquittal. Other evidence contributes too and, with that evidence, warrants a finding that the applicant has been and continues to be truly remorseful and contrite for his actions. 
      
       
        
       
     17    It is necessary to bear in mind that, for an elderly person “[e]ach year spent in prison represents a substantial portion of the remaining years of life which [he or she] may expect"": Hunter (1984) 36 SASR 101. I also accept the submission made on behalf of the applicant that to be sentenced towards the end of one's life, as the applicant has been, means that there will be little opportunity to live down the shame and disgrace which the commission of the offences has occasioned. The longer the sentence the shorter the opportunity. 
      
       
        
       
     18    Generally speaking, ill health will be a factor tending to mitigate punishment only where it appears that imprisonment will be a greater burden on the offender by reason of his state of health or where there is a serious risk of imprisonment having a gravely adverse effect on the offender's health: Smith (supra); McDonald (1988) 38 ACrimR 470; Sellen (1991) 57 ACrimR 313; Bailey (1988) 34 ACrimR 154). 
      
       
        
       
     19    At the time of sentencing, the applicant had undergone treatment for a heart condition. That was the situation before he was charged with the offences. Ten days after being charged the applicant presented himself to his treating medical practitioner, Dr Yiannikas, with increased angina. The extent of coronary artery disease was diagnosed and the applicant underwent coronary bypass surgery and mitral valve replacement. There were post-operative complications requiring drainage of the lungs, for which the applicant was hospitalised on four occasions. 
      
       
        
       
     20    Dr Yiannikas said in a report: 
      
       
        
         
          
          ""Continuing and unrelenting stress would play a role in bad hypertension management and in turn may deteriorate both his coronary disease and left ventricular function. It is at times possible that circumstances of continuing severe stress may precipitate acute coronary occlusion"". 
          
         
        
       
     21    At that stage, the doctor estimated the applicant's annual mortality risk at approximately three to five per cent, so that there was, according to the doctor, approximately a 25 per cent chance that the applicant would not be alive in five years time. That was the state of the evidence as to health which was before the sentencing judge. 
      
       
        
       
     22    I would find, on that evidence, that the applicant's health was likely to be adversely affected by incarceration and that, because of his ill health, incarceration would be more onerous to him than would generally be the case.  
      
       
        
       
     23    Since sentence, the applicant's cardiac condition has deteriorated further and he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer. A biopsy and scan were recommended to confirm the existence of the cancer and to ascertain its extent and type for the purpose of management. The applicant is being held at the Junee Correctional Centre. It was thought that it would be necessary for the applicant to be brought to Sydney to enable the diagnostic procedures to be carried out. Having been brought to Sydney it was found the applicant could not be accommodated for those procedures at that time. It was then ascertained that the procedures could be carried out in Wagga Wagga. That was done. In the result, it had taken approximately six months for the diagnostic procedures to be carried out. That was attributable to the applicant's incarceration. 
      
       
        
       
     24    The applicant is under the care of a urologist, Dr J T Smith of Wagga Wagga, for the prostate condition. He has prescribed treatment. In his report of 27 March 2001, Dr Smith stated the prognosis needed to be guarded. If the response to treatment was good, the applicant would still have a 40 per cent chance of succumbing to the disease, which I take to mean dying from it. A more recent report shows the response to treatment has been good, so that is the prognosis. 
      
       
        
       
     25    Dr Smith did not think that imprisonment would have any major physical impact on the spread of the cancer or the treatment the applicant was to receive. There was, however, according to the doctor, the psychological worry of the disease and, being a doctor himself, the applicant would be more aware of the possible complications which include spread of the disease to other parts of the body. 
      
       
        
       
     26    Dr Yiannikas contributed an up-to-date assessment of the applicant's cardiac condition in an affidavit sworn on 13 August 2001. The doctor had obviously been unaware that the applicant would be going to gaol. He now addressed the effect of imprisonment. The applicant is on long term anticoagulation therapy because of the valve replacement. The doctor said that the usual risks of embolism and of bleeding associated with such treatment were substantially greater in prison because anticoagulation management was more erratic in the physical and emotional environment of gaol. The applicant is prone to significant cardiac arrhythmias which, according to the doctor, may not be well tolerated and would increase his risk of morbidity and mortality, including the possibility of stroke. 
      
       
        
       
     27    The applicant has now suffered urinary tract infections associated with his prostate condition. According to Dr Yiannikas, such infections may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias and give rise to the risk of infection associated with the prosthetic valve. Any such infection has a 50 to 75 per cent mortality rate. The stress of incarceration, according to the doctor, could also contribute to arrhythmias and/or coronary occlusion. 
      
       
        
       
     28    Dr Yiannikas revised his previous estimate of annual mortality risk, being now aware that the applicant is serving a gaol sentence and of the prostate cancer. This he now estimated at 10 per cent annually over and above someone the applicant's age without heart disease. That, as I understand it, translates to no better than a 50 per cent chance that the applicant will be alive in five years time. 
      
       
        
       
     29    This is an exceptional case. The offences are very serious and are not to be underrated. On the other hand, subjective features in mitigation of penalty are exceptionally strong. I have regard in particular to the applicant's state of health. He is now seventy-two years of age. His life is likely to be shorter than the average for that age. Also, because of his medical conditions, imprisonment has been and will continue to be very much more onerous for him than in the usual case.  
      
       
        
       
     30    The last of these considerations warrants a finding of special circumstances and I would make that finding. 
      
       
        
       
     31    I would propose the following orders: 
      
       
        
         
        1. Extend time for application for leave to appeal and for appeal. 
         
         
        2. Grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal. 
         
         
        3. Re-sentence the applicant as follows: 
         
         
          
          (a) In respect of the first count, imprisonment for three years commencing on 30 June 2000 with a non-parole period of one year and six months, expiring on 29 December 2001, on which date the applicant will be entitled to be released on parole; 
          
         
         
          
          (b) In respect of the second count, imprisonment for a fixed term of twelve months, commencing on 30 June 2000 to be served concurrently with the sentence under count one. 
          
         
        
       
     32    WOOD CJ at CL: I agree. The orders of the Court will be as Sperling J has proposed, save that the Court will make an order for the release of the applicant on parole on 30 December 2001, the conditions of parole to include that he be subject to supervision by the Probation and Parole Service.

      REGINA V JAMES WOODMAN 
       
       
       JUDGMENT 
       
     1   WOOD CJ AT CL: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed upon him by Nield DCJ in the District Court on 19 January 2001, following his pleas of guilty to five offences of dishonesty. Four of those offences involved counts of fraudulently omitting to account for a deposit, or for rent, received by him from a prospective purchaser and tenants respectively in his capacity as a real estate agent. The fifth related to a count of fraudulently converting property to his own use, namely monies received by way of rental bond.  
     2   In relation to the count relating to the fraudulent omission to account for the deposit, a further eighteen matters were taken into account on a form one, including ten offences of fraudulently converting rent or rental bond monies to his own use; four offences of fraudulently omitting to account for rental bond money, and four counts of fraudulently misappropriating rental bond monies. 
     3   The various offences in the indictment were charged under s 88(a)(i) and s 88(b)(i) of the Property Stock & Business Act 1941,each of which provides for maximum sentences of imprisonment for ten years.  
     4   Fourteen of the matters in the form 1, similarly came within these provisions, while the four offences of fraudulent misappropriation came within s178A of the Crimes Act 1900 and as such were offences which potentially attracted maximum penalties of imprisonment for seven years.  
     5   In relation to the offences involving the omission to account for the deposit in the amount of $18,625, in respect of which the form 1 matters were taken into account, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for three years and nine months with a non parole period of one year and three months, a period representing approximately thirty three percent of the head sentence. For each of the remaining counts on the indictment the applicant was sentenced to fixed terms of one year and three months to be served concurrently with the sentence last mentioned.  
     6   The total amount involved in the various offences, including those in the form 1 was $62,231.83. The offences were committed over a period of four years between 24 June 1994 and 8 July 1998. 
     7   In addition to the sentences of imprisonment the applicant was ordered to pay compensation, for the full amount involved in the various offences, to the Department of Fair Trading by way of recoupment of the monies which it had paid out to the victims of the applicant's dishonesty. Those victims, naturally enough, were either tenants, landlords or prospective purchaser.  
     8   All of the offences were committed during the period when the applicant was self employed as a real estate agent at Kirribilli. Although the proceeds of the four offences were not specifically traced, it was assumed that they were used to meet the various debts of the business, which apparently was not particularly successful.  
     9   The offences came to light following a complaint to the Department of Fair Trading in August 1997. At a meeting with a departmental inspector in September of that year the applicant acknowledged his criminality. 
     10   For reasons which have not been satisfactorily explained the investigation was not completed for a further sixteen months. The applicant, however, entered a plea of guilty in the Local Court, once charged; and that circumstance, along with his contrition which his Honour accepted as genuine, properly led to him receiving a discount of twenty five percent. 
     11   The applicant was forty five years of age when he appeared for sentence and was otherwise accepted to have been of impeccable character, having no prior convictions and being the recipient of a number of favourable references. He was divorced but was providing support for his three children, who were living with their mother. He was, at the time of sentence, holding down two jobs, one a full time position as a coaxial cable installer and the other a part time position as a night time attendant at a service station. The latter position he had held over the preceding two months. 
     12   Although the question of reparation had been discussed with him, it was not until he appeared for sentence that he offered to make payments to the Department in the sum of $200 per week, to be made from his earnings which then amounted to $868 net per week. 
     13   There was evidence to the effect that he had been suffering from depression, following the separation from his wife, as well as from pressures to pay the various monies owed in connection with his business. His Honour accepted that he was unlikely to reoffend and that he had the support of his fiance.  
     14   In passing sentence his Honour appropriately noted that the offences were very serious, that they had been committed over a relatively long period of time and that they involved serious breaches of trust. While specific deterrence was not regarded as important as it might have been in another case, his Honour emphasised the importance of general deterrence observing: 
      
       
        
        ""People in the position of the prisoner, having control over the money of other people, their clients and their principals, must be made aware of the obligations in relation to those clients and those principals. People in the position of the prisoner must be deterred by the punishments imposed on offenders from breaching the trust imposed in them by their clients and principals."" 
        
       
     15   Clearly his Honour was correct in stating the seriousness of the offences, it being particularly apposite in the case of a real estate agent whose business involved the regular receipt of monies from tenants and purchasers to be held on trust for landlords and vendors. Their business depends upon their clients reposing trust in them and in having that trust respected.  
     16   His Honour rejected the submission that the circumstances of the case were exceptional and as such justified a sentence which would have been other than one involving imprisonment on a full time custodial basis. To the contrary of that submission, his Honour found that the circumstances were the same as those which regrettably are usually seen in cases such as the present, where the offender having use of someone else's money misapplied it, converted it or misappropriated it either to his own use or to his own ends. 
     17   His Honour also made it clear that he had not misunderstood or misapplied the principle of totality in specifying a sentence appropriate for the count involving the largest amount of money, being the last in point of time, in respect of which the matters on the form 1 were to be taken into account; and in then specifying the sentences which were considered appropriate and which were to be served concurrently, for the remaining counts in the indictment.  
     18   Special circumstances were found referable to the need of the applicant to be supervised and assisted on his return to society. The findings made in this regard were, in my view, unduly favourable to the applicant in the light of the assessment which was made that he was unlikely to reoffend, and in light of the circumstances that he had no particular problems of health or otherwise that needed to be addressed, that he had a supporting partner, and that he had employment available. Properly assessed I have difficulty, as a matter of law, in seeing why special circumstances were found to exist. However, since any error in that regard operates in favour of the applicant and has not been the subject of a Crown appeal, that circumstance can be ignored for the purposes of this appeal.  
     19   In substance, two grounds of appeal were addressed when the matter came on for hearing this morning, a third ground having been abandoned by reason of the circumstance that the applicant has served a good proportion of the non parole period. 
      
      SENTENCE OUTSIDE THE RANGE. 
       
     20   This submission largely turned upon the proposition that a large proportion of offenders convicted of similar offences had been dealt with by way of a sentence of a non custodial kind, and upon the further proposition that of those cases attracting a sentence of full time imprisonment the great majority had received a lesser sentence than that imposed here. 
     21   I observe that reference to the Judicial Commission's statistics in relation to this submission is of no value whatsoever since the case population for a fraudulent omission to account offence is one, that being a case which in fact attracted a head sentence of three years and six months. No case is recorded for a s88(a)(i) offence. For what it is worth, in relation to the offence of fraudulent misappropriation under s 178A of the Crimes Act, the statistics show that sixty-one percent of all offenders receive prison terms (out of a case population of seventy-six) and of those sixty-four percent received full terms of three years or more. 
     22   In any event, reference to statistics is of limited value in the case of this form of criminality, given the enormous variation in objective and subjective circumstances involved (see Brown NSW CCA 1 August 1994). A similar problem also arises when an attempt is made, as it was here, to compare a specific offence of dishonesty with other cases involving dishonesty of a different kind. 
     23   In the present case reference was made to a “schedule of fraud appeals” between 9 July 1999 and July 2001. Examination of that schedule and of the attached cases shows that many of them involved offences with a lesser maximum penalty and some were Crown appeals involving the principle of double jeopardy and/or the discretion which attaches to that form of appeal. In fact closer examination of the cases included in the schedule does point up the significant variations in the objective and subjective circumstances involved. 
     24   In Hawker (2001) NSW CCA 148, that being one of the cases included in the schedule, I drew attention at paragraph 17 and 18 to the danger involved in attempting to extract a range of sentences from an exercise of this kind. I see no reason to resile from the observations there made. In any event I do note that the cases in the schedule by no means bear out the submission which is here sought to be advanced. 
     25   Far greater assistance is derived by reference to general sentencing principles in relation to white collar crime. In Pantano (1990) 49 A Crim R 328 at 330 I said: 
      
       
        
        ""Those involved in serious white collar crime must expect condign sentences. The commercial world expects executives and employees in positions of trust to conform to exacting standards of honesty. It is impossible to be unmindful of the difficulty of detecting sophisticated crime of the kind here involved, or of the possibility for substantial financial loss by the public. Executives and trusted employees who give way to temptation cannot pass the blame to lax security on the part of management. The element of general deterrence is an important element of sentencing for such offences."" 
        
       
     26   Those remarks are equally applicable to the case of a sole employee who does not have anybody looking over his or her shoulder. In Regina v El-Rashid (NSW CCA 7 April 1995) Gleeson CJ said: 
      
       
        
        ""Considerations of general deterrence are of particular importance in sentencing for crimes of this nature. Such crimes frequently involve...a serious breach of trust. Such breaches of trust are usually able to be committed because of the previous good character of the person who has been placed in a position of trust."" 
        
       
       
        
       
     27   The principles identified in these cases are reflected in many other decisions of this court, for example see Halabi (NSW CCA 17 February 1992); Pont (2000) NSW CCA 419; Corner  NSW CCA 19 December 1997; Law NSW CCA 7 October 1993 and Tyrrell NSW CCA 25 November 1994).  
     28   Also of relevance in the present case is the decision of this Court in Hawkins (1989) 45 A Crim R 430 where the court said: 
      
       
        
        ""In considering the gravity of the offences objectively as is required...the amounts of money involved are a significant matter for consideration. The amount of money involved in cases of pre meditated planned deception and fraud are of necessity an important factor in the question of determining the degree of criminality for they are an indication of the extent to which a prisoner is prepared to be dishonest and to flout the law and to advance whatever are his own purposes"".  
        
       
     29   In citing that case with approval, this court in Regina v Mears (NSW CCA 14 March 1991) added: 
      
       
        
        ""There are a number of cases as well as that one, which make it clear that the period of time over which the offences are committed is also a relevant factor in determining the extent of criminality. The motive of the persons involved is also a relevant factor"". 
        
       
     30   The present is a case involving a considerable period of time, a not insignificant amount of money and more than a handful of victims. It was also not an impulsive offence. I am quite unpersuaded his Honour overlooked any relevant circumstance or overstated the seriousness of the present offences. Nor am I persuaded that the sentence imposed was out of range. As Kirby ACJ, (as he then was) said in Law: 
      
       
        
        ""This court sits to correct error of law not to substitute the sentence which it might have imposed itself"".  
        
       
     31   No error has been shown in this respect. 
      
       
      INSUFFICIENT WEIGHT GIVEN TO THE OFFER OF REPARATION. 
       
     32   The offer by the applicant to make reparation was of limited value to him, particularly in the absence of any earlier attempt to do so. It is not the case that an offender found guilty of fraud offences can purchase mitigation by way of a voluntary repayment. While the degree of sacrifice involved can be taken into account it cannot be overlooked that an order for compensation, or reparation does no more than require the return of illgotten gains to which the offender had no entitlement.  
     33   Moreover, as Hunt CJ at CL pointed out in Phelan (1993) 66 A Crim R 446: 
      
       
        
        ""It is more of a matter of aggravation when there has been a loss which is effectively irretrievable than a matter of mitigation where the loss has been made good"".  
        
       
     34   In the light of these considerations I reject as unfounded the argument that there would be some utility in reducing the applicant's sentence, or to deal with him on a non custodial basis, so that could continue to work and thereby fund the repayments ordered. He is of course perfectly able to resume those payments once released upon parole. 
     35   While it may be accepted that the applicant had limited means before he acquired the second job, and while it may also be accepted he was suffering from a degree of depression, it remains the fact that he had made no real attempt, before appearing for sentence, to offer anything by way of reparation. The explanation offered to the effect that he was waiting to be approached by the Department, and that he did not realise that he could make payments directly to the victims himself is unconvincing. 
     36   I am unpersuaded that his Honour relied upon this matter as something operating in aggravation of sentence as distinct from a matter that might otherwise have demonstrated a degree of contrition. His Honour's observation ""it was unfortunate there had been no reparations"" does not carry with it the inference that it was regarded as a matter increasing the sentence. No error has been shown in that regard and accordingly this ground has not been made out. 
     37   I finally observe that although a submission was originally made that a non custodial sentence would have been open in this case, that ground has not been pursued having regard to the period already served. While it has not been dealt with I would make it perfectly plain that I would not have considered this case to have been exceptional, and as such one that might have attracted a non custodial option. 
     38   For those various reasons therefore I am unpersuaded that any error occurred, and although I would grant leave to appeal I would dismiss the appeal. 
     39   SPERLING J: I agree. 
     40   WOOD CJ AT CL: The order of the court therefore will be as I proposed.  **********

       REGINA v BRENDAN MICHAEL HANDLEY 
        
        
       JUDGMENT 
        
       
       
     1   WOOD CJ at CL: This is an application for leave to appeal against a sentence of imprisonment of three years and one month, with a non parole period of eighteen months, imposed by Bellear DCJ in the District Court following the applicant’s plea of guilty to one count of supply a prohibited drug on an ongoing basis.  
     2   The maximum available sentence for such an offence, which is regarded as a particularly serious offence, is imprisonment for twenty years (see s25A Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985).  
     3   The applicant was arrested following execution of a search warrant at his home on 29 April 1999. During the search, which was made that day, two bags containing amphetamines were found along with various accoutrements of the drug trade, including a number of resealable plastic bags, a set of electronic scales, a number of syringes, a diary containing names and details of amounts paid or payable and some “tick” list. By that latter expression I understand the documents to refer to drugs supplied “on tick” for which payment was to be supplied at some later date. 
     4   When interviewed, the applicant freely admitted that he had been selling amphetamine from the home and around the Blacktown area for approximately eighteen months, earning somewhere between $200 and $400 per week, after subtracting from his sales such amphetamines as he needed for his own use. He agreed that $100 in bank notes found in the premises represented the proceeds of a sale of three half weights made earlier that day. 
     5   The amphetamine which he sold, he acknowledged, had been purchased by him in two gram lots and cut with glucose. He also acknowledged that he had ten to twelve regular customers. His own use of amphetamines was accepted as having been significant and that he was in the habit of injecting speed three to four times per day.  
     6   Additionally, found in the search, was a pair of knuckle dusters, which he said had been given to him by a friend and which he had decided to keep. 
     7   At the time of the sentence, his Honour took into account in a Form 1 offences of supply prohibited drug, possession of prohibited drug, self administer prohibited drug, goods in custody and possession of prohibited article, that is the knuckle dusters. Each of those charges, it may be noted, was intrinsically bound up either with the items found in the premises or in relation to admissions made as to the recent sale and/or self use of drugs.  
     8   The applicant, who appeared in person, raised two grounds of appeal in support of the submission that the sentence was excessive. First, it was submitted that the drugs found were for his personal use and that he was not in fact dealing drugs. The comprehensive admissions in the ERISP and the records kept in relation to the sales made and the moneys owing for drugs supplied established that there is no basis whatever for the submission that he was not dealing in drugs. 
     9   The situation is that he was dealing in drugs, partly to support his own habit and partly for profit. The former factor is a matter which was proper to be taken into account, but I see no reason to assume that his Honour overlooked that consideration. 
     10   Secondly, it was submitted that the sentence was one occasioning his spouse and her children both emotional and mental hardship. It was a fact that at the time of the offence the applicant was living in a de facto relationship with a partner and her two children, one of whom tragically had cerebral palsy, epilepsy and asthma and who clearly needed a great deal of attention. The other child has an attention deficit disorder. 
     11   it was also the case the applicant was unemployed and in receipt of social security benefits. He had previously been married and had two children of his own, but it seems that he was not in any contact of a regular kind with them. He was a user of both cannabis and amphetamine but by the time he appeared for sentence it was accepted that he had given up that drug habit. 
     12   His partner was supportive of him and strongly opposed to his drug use. He had a prior record of no great moment and he had demonstrated considerable bravery less than a month after his arrest, when attempting to save a child who was trapped in a house fire, earning for himself a bronze medal from the Australian Humane Society. 
     13   Whilst his record is most unfortunate and while there is considerable room for optimism that he has learned his lesson and can give valuable support to his de facto partner and children if drug free and law abiding, I am not persuaded that any of these considerations was overlooked, or that they gave rise to a concern that the sentence imposed was excessive 
     14   It is the fact that inevitably hardship is occasioned where a member of a household is sentenced to imprisonment. The relevant principle was expressed by this Court in Regina v T (1990) 47 A Crim R 29 at 40, in the following terms: 
      
       
        
        “It is only in circumstances of exceptional hardship to the applicant’s family that the Court will take into account that hardship in mitigation of sentence. The hardship must be so ‘extreme’ - going so far beyond the sort of hardship which inevitably results to a family when the breadwinner is imprisoned, that ‘a sense of mercy or of affronted common sense imperatively demands that they (the sentencing judges) should draw back’.” 
        
       
     15   The present is not such a case. Otherwise, his Honour took into account the extent to which the applicant had taken steps to rehabilitate himself, as well as the better side of him that was disclosed by his bravery award. 
     16   These matters, including his family relationship and his need for continued drug counselling and supervision, were appropriately recognised as special circumstances which justified the setting of a non-parole period, which was just under fifty per cent of the head sentence. 
     17   Any lesser sentence would, in my view, have been manifestly lenient having regard to the punitive and deterrent elements which must apply to the offence of supply narcotics on a continuing basis. 
     18   I would grant leave to appeal but I would dismiss the appeal. 
     19   SPERLING J: I agree. 
     20   WOOD CJ at CL: The order of the Court will be as I proposed.

    THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONTuesday 28 August 2001SPERLING J12425/01 Joseph Ayoub v Magistrate Stapleton and Commissioner of PoliceJudgment 
     
      
       
      
    1    HIS HONOUR: There is currently proceeding in the Local Court a summary hearing in relation to some eleven charges consisting of an alleged shoplifting offence, and alleged offences of goods in custody. It is fair to say that the value of property involved appears to be very small. 
     
      
       
      
    2    On 3 July 2001, an application was made on behalf of the defendant in those proceedings for an order pursuant to s 32 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990. The application was refused, and the proceedings were adjourned to be heard on 27 and 28 August 2001. 
     
      
       
      
    3    Proceedings were instituted in this court on 2 August 2001, by summons filed on behalf of the defendant in the Local Court proceedings and to whom I will now refer as “the plaintiff”. Those proceedings were dismissed on 16 August. 
     
      
       
      
    4    A further summons was filed in the same proceedings claiming other relief, in substance an order in the nature of certiorari quashing the determination of 3 July and a further order that the learned Magistrate determine the application according to law. 
     
      
       
      
    5    What then occurred need not be recorded until one comes to 27 August, on which date the Commissioner of Police was joined as a defendant to the proceedings and orders were made for short service on the Commissioner, the summons being listed for twelve noon today. 
     
      
       
      
    6    In the proceedings before me today, Mr Asuzu appears for the plaintiff and Mr McIlwaine appears for the Commissioner. Evidence in support of the summons has been tendered on behalf of the plaintiff, consisting substantially of the record of the proceedings before the Local Court. An affidavit by the plaintiff has been filed in court but not read. For present purposes I recognise that affidavit as evidence in the proceedings before me. 
     
      
       
      
    7    The Commissioner having been notified for the first time this morning of these proceedings, Mr McIlwaine has fairly observed that, in a number of respects, he is not in a position to deal fully and adequately with some of the assertions that are made in support of the application. It is submitted on behalf of the Commissioner that the summons should be dismissed on discretionary grounds. 
     
      
       
      
    8    The state of the proceedings in the Local Court is currently that the hearing of the charges proceeded yesterday, 27 August, and, as I understand it, this morning, 28 August. A further date, 14 September, has been allocated, in the event that the proceedings are not completed; but, unless the plaintiff goes into evidence, there is the prospect that the charges will be determined in the space of the two days, 27 and 28 August. 
     
      
       
      
    9    It is a relevant consideration that, in the event of the magistrate having erred in the dismissal of the application pursuant to s 32, the error would be available as a ground of appeal against any conviction. 
     
      
       
      
    10    It has been said many times that this court will be slow to intervene by way of the grant of prerogative relief in relation to proceedings which are in progress. Because of that reluctance, the fact that any error would be available as a ground upon which to impugn a conviction, the lateness in commencing the proceedings and in putting them into a state where they could proceed against the appropriate defendant, the unreasonableness of expecting that defendant, namely, the Commissioner of Police, to deal adequately with the claim at such short notice, it is necessary to dismiss the summons in the exercise of the court’s discretion, notwithstanding that it error may be assumed for present purposes. 
     
      
       
      
    11    Accordingly, the order of the court is that the summons is dismissed. 
     
      
       
      
    12    The ordinary rule is that costs follow the event. I am not persuaded that there is any reason to the contrary. The plaintiff is ordered to pay the costs of the Commissioner of Police in these proceedings.

     70101/98 Regina v Stephen John Wilkes 
      
       
    Reasons for Verdict1     HIS HONOUR: The accused, Stephen John Wilkes, has been tried before me, sitting without a jury, upon a charge that he murdered a man called Thomas Dungay at a caravan park at Kempsey in the afternoon of the 22 September 1998. He is alleged to have beaten the deceased severely about the head and body with a piece of wood, such that the deceased had already died from the head injuries when ambulance officers and police arrived at the scene.  
     
      
       
      
    2     That morning the accused and a number of others gathered at one of the caravans in the park, caravan 40. Most of the group, including the accused, were Aboriginal. Among those present were the accused’s two brothers, John and Robert Wilkes. At some later time the deceased, who lived in caravan 5, joined them.  
     
      
       
      
    3     The accused did not give evidence but he gave an account of the events of that afternoon to police in an electronically recorded interview. A number of people who were in caravan 40 gave evidence, as did several other eye witnesses. As one would expect, given the vagaries of human observation and recollection, there is a measure of conflict in this evidence. Particularly is this so of the testimony of the people in van 40, most of whom, like the accused himself, had had more than enough to drink. However, a number of facts emerge clearly enough from the evidence and, indeed, it would appear from the final addresses of counsel that these are common ground.  
     
      
       
      
    4     After he arrived at caravan 40 the deceased got into an argument. It is not entirely clear who the initial participants were or what the argument was about, but nothing turns on it. The deceased produced a knife. At about this time the accused became involved in the altercation, and the deceased menaced him with the knife. According to John Wilkes, the deceased was waving the knife around and threatening to kill whoever was standing in front of him. He punched the accused, causing him to fall and to suffer a bleeding nose.  
     
      
       
      
    5     Another man disarmed the deceased, who left caravan 40 and ran back to caravan 5. He was pursued by three men. Two of them were John Wilkes and a fair skinned man named Scott Payne. The third man, who was Aboriginal, was carrying the piece of wood to which I have referred. In fact, it was a fence picket which had been used as a garden stake for a shrub immediately outside caravan 40. It is that man who beat the deceased to death behind caravan 5. The central issue in the case is whether that man was the accused.  
     
      
       
      
    6     According to John Wilkes, it was. However, his evidence must be approached with circumspection. He claimed to have witnessed the killing from a position about thirty to forty metres away, when it is clear that he himself was behind caravan 5 at that time. In addition, he gave police an entirely inconsistent account, which did not implicate the accused in any way. The matter turns primarily upon the evidence of some independent and sober eye witnesses, together with some other evidence to which I shall turn in due course.  
     
      
       
      
    7     The resident of caravan 39, next to caravan 40, was Karen Ridgeway. The deceased’s caravan, number 5, was more or less at the opposite end of the park. About midway between them stood the house of the park’s proprietors, Pieter Slappendel and his wife, Sandra Slappendel. Graeme Clenton lived in caravan 4, next to the deceased’s. All four gave evidence. Their honesty is unquestioned. Ms Ridgeway and Mr and Mrs Slappendel gave evidence in an intelligent and dispassionate manner. Mr Clenton’s evidence was vivid and emotional, suggesting that what he witnessed has left emotional scars which have not yet healed, but there is no reason to doubt the accuracy of his account of material matters. 
     
      
       
      
    8     Ms Ridgeway heard the sound of an altercation in caravan 40 and went to investigate it. As she approached the caravan, the deceased emerged from it. She saw him pursued by two Aboriginal men, neither of whom she knew. She did not notice a third man. One of the Aboriginal men was carrying the fence picket and her description of that man was consistent with the appearance of the accused. It seems that Robert Wilkes was the only one of the three brothers whom she knew. He, she said, was still in the caravan.  
     
      
       
      
    9     Mrs Slappendel was at home and she was able to observe the pursuit of the deceased by the three men. She said that she recognized the man carrying the fence picket as a man who had been pointed out to her about twelve months earlier as the accused. He was wearing a red checked shirt. Her view of the beating was obscured by caravan 5, but immediately after it the three men emerged from behind the caravan and walked towards the house. She approached them and asked them what was going on. The man she believed to be the accused, who was still holding the fence picket, said, “He pulled a knife on me.” One of the other men said, “Yeah, he cut him on the hand.” At this point, I should observe that there is no evidence that the accused had such a cut (although it seems that John Wilkes suffered a minor cut to his hand.)  
     
      
       
      
    10     Mr Slappendel was mowing the lawn some fifty metres from caravan 5. He did not see the deceased being pursued but he saw him standing behind caravan 5 gesticulating, as if in an altercation. He then saw a large Aboriginal man strike him a number of times with the fence picket. Although he knew the accused, he did not recognize him as that man at that moment. He saw the assailant and the other two men, who had been obscured from his view by the caravan, walk to where they were met by his wife. He recognised John Wilkes and “suspected” that the man carrying the fence picket was the accused. He also said that that man was wearing a red checked shirt. He saw him throw the piece of wood into the garden next to the office. The three men then walked in the direction of caravan 40.  
     
      
       
      
    11     Mr Slappendel went to attend to the deceased and had his wife call the ambulance and the police. A police officer arrived very promptly and asked Mr Slappendel what the deceased’s assailant looked like. Mr Slappendel walked in the direction in which the three men had gone, and he said that he saw them outside caravan 40. There were a number of people there but the three men were standing apart from them. He was then certain that the man he had seen with the fence picket was the accused, whom he observed to have removed his shirt. The three men were arguing, as he put it, “over who had done what and who had done what first”. He assumed them to have been speaking of the incident which he had just witnessed. About five minutes had elapsed since his seeing the men speaking to his wife.  
     
      
       
      
    12     A little later, Mr Slappendel saw the accused arrested at the scene and observed him still to be bare-chested. From the police evidence, however, it is clear that the accused was then wearing a blue and white striped, collared T-shirt. 
     
      
       
      
    13     Mr Clenton witnessed the beating of the deceased from the rear window of caravan 4. At the time of the attack he could see the arms of the assailant, particularly the right arm which was wielding the fence picket. That man’s skin colour was consistent with his being Aboriginal. He saw him walk away after the beating and, although he could not identify him, he observed that he was a big man. Reconciling his recollection in this Court with his statements to police shortly after the event, it would seem that he could see the bare arms of that man as he walked away and the man was wearing a red checked upper garment, either a singlet or a short sleeved shirt. At no time, apparently, did he see the other two men.  
     
      
       
      
    14     The only independent witnesses purporting to identify the accused as the attacker are Mr and Mrs Slappendel. I am mindful of the dangers of identification evidence and, forthright and honest as it was, I must examine their evidence carefully to assess its accuracy. 
     
      
       
      
    15     Mrs Slappendel had never met the accused but, as I have said, her evidence was that he had been pointed out to her about twelve months earlier, apparently as a participant in some disturbance at the caravan park. She had seen that man on two or three occasions since, when he visited the park, although she said that those occasions were no more than “fleeting glances”. This was the first occasion she had ever spoken to him.  
     
      
       
      
    16     She said that, from her first sighting of him, she had been impressed by his large, solid physique. This, I suppose, is very much in the eye of the beholder. I only saw him seated in court, but during the videotaped interview he was asked to stand so that an assessment might be made of his height and build. He is a little over six feet tall and I would agree with his own description of his build as “medium”. More importantly, Mrs Slappendel described the hair of the man she believed to be the accused on the day in question as blonde but darker at the roots, apparently having been dyed. It is true that the accused’s hair, which was grey, had been dyed but it was a dark colour. It can be seen in photographs taken of him after his arrest and was described by one of the police officers as “a maroony brown colour” with “grey through it”. Although the photos also depict facial stubble and a prominent moustache, Mrs Slappendel did not notice those features. Nor did she observe his bleeding nose.  
     
      
       
      
    17     She did not know Robert Wilkes but she said that she knew John Wilkes “pretty well”, having seen him as a frequent visitor to the caravan park over some years and having spoken to him on a number of occasions. Nevertheless, when shown a photograph of Robert Wilkes, she initially did not recognize the person depicted but then said that she believed that it was John Wilkes. Of course, there may be some similarity between the two men as they are brothers. I did not see Robert Wilkes, as the Crown was not able to secure his attendance at the trial.  
     
      
       
      
    18     These matters must cause one to question the reliability of her assertion that the man she saw with the fence picket was the man who had earlier been pointed out to her as the accused. Moreover, there is now no way to test the accuracy of the identification of the accused on that earlier occasion, because Mrs Slappendel had no firm recollection of who it was who pointed him out. She believed that it was Karen Ridgeway, but that could not be so because, as I have said, Ms Ridgeway did not know the accused.  
     
      
       
      
    19     Mr Slappendel said that he had known the accused for seven or eight years as a visitor to the caravan park. He had spoken to him on many occasions, although their conversations had never been more than “a few words”. His description of the height and build of the man he saw with the fence picket was consistent with the appearance of the accused. He said that the man’s hair “looked like he had put blonde tips or streaks through it a bit”. He was asked no more about this, and it is difficult to determine how consistent that description is with the appearance of the accused’s hair at the time. Mr Slappendel was better acquainted with John Wilkes, whom he had known longer. He also had never met Robert Wilkes.  
     
      
       
      
    20     His evidence also raises concerns about the accuracy of his identification of the accused on the day in question. Like his wife, he made no mention of the accused’s facial hair. He said that he had last seen him about three months prior to the incident. In fact, the accused had travelled to Kempsey from Sydney the night before and had not been in the area for about six months. In the light of the police evidence, I am satisfied that he was mistaken when he said that the accused was not wearing a shirt at the time of his arrest. Equally, he may have been mistaken when he said that the accused was bare-chested outside caravan 40, or it may be that the man he saw at that time was not the accused.  
     
      
       
      
    21     Perhaps more importantly, there is a danger that his seeing the accused arrested caused him unconsciously to assume that he was the man whom he had seen earlier. Despite his prior contact with him, he was not confident until he saw the three men outside caravan 40 that the accused was one of them. He had gone to that caravan in response to a question by a police officer about the appearance of the offender, no doubt expecting that he would find him in that vicinity. He may well have assumed that the three men he then saw were the same as those he had seen earlier, given that the group comprised two Aboriginal men and a fair skinned man and included John Wilkes, whom he knew well enough. Certainly, he assumed that the conversation he heard between those men related to the incident he had seen. As he put it in evidence, “I wouldn’t think they would be talking about any other fight from what I had just seen a few minutes earlier”. Of course, he had no knowledge at that time of the earlier altercation in caravan 40. His evidence also suggests that it was the presence of this man in the company of John Wilkes, at the time they were speaking to his wife, which initially led him to suspect that it was the accused.  
     
      
       
      
    22     Mr and Mrs Slappendel did not say whether the shirt the assailant was wearing was short-sleeved but, in the light of Mr Clenton’s evidence, I am satisfied that it was. That being so, it is significant that none of the three witnesses described the accused’s tattoos which, from the photographs of him, appear to be prominent and to cover both forearms. In fairness, it should be said that Mr Clenton was the only one of the three witnesses who was specifically asked about them.  
     
      
       
      
    23     As I have said, the shirt which the accused was wearing at the time of his arrest was different from that which the witnesses described. The Crown prosecutor suggested that the accused had changed his shirt after the incident, perhaps because it had incriminating blood stains, and that this explained Mr Slappendel’s evidence that he was bare-chested when he saw him outside caravan 40. She referred to scientific evidence that the shirt the accused was wearing at the time of his arrest was stained with blood which was neither his nor the deceased’s, despite the fact that his nose was bleeding and there were blood stains on his jeans which proved to be his own.  
     
      
       
      
    24     On the other hand, I have already questioned the reliability of Mr Slappendel’s evidence that the accused was without a shirt at caravan 40. Police searched for a red checked shirt, without success. Of course, if the accused had changed his shirt he could have done so only by exchanging it for someone else’s, as he did not live in the caravan. Nevertheless, from the photographs it appears that the blue and white striped shirt fits him. The presence of the unidentified blood stains on that shirt might be explained by the evidence of one witness that, prior to his arrest, he was cuddling other people who had been in the caravan. At the time of his arrest he was also wearing a baseball cap, to which none of the witnesses referred, although the evidence does not disclose whether he had it on earlier. 
     
      
       
      
    25     Mr and Mrs Slappendel frankly acknowledged that they had talked together about what they had seen, including their belief that the assailant was the accused, before they made their statements to the police. The police did not conduct any formal identification procedure, such as an identification parade or a photographic array. In all the circumstances, I am left with a sense of unease about the identification evidence. It is necessary, then, to turn to the other evidence in the case and to determine what conclusions can fairly be drawn from the whole of the evidence.  
     
      
       
      
    26     It is also common ground that the killing of the deceased was triggered by his behaviour during the altercation in caravan 40, so that the perpetrator must have been one of the men who had been in that caravan. An ambulance officer who attended the scene after the attack spoke to a man whom he described and who, it was accepted, must have been the accused. The accused said, “I hit him”. Asked what he had hit the deceased with, he said with his hands. He added, as the witness put it in evidence, “You’d have done the same too if he had done what he threatened to do to his family”. The witness thought that he also said that he didn’t mean to kill him.  
     
      
       
      
    27     In the recorded interview with police, the accused described the argument in the caravan, the deceased producing a knife and he himself being hit. He said that he did not know who hit him, but it is clear from other evidence that it was the deceased. He said that he was “sort of in a daze and knocked out”. He believed that someone had helped him up and that he walked to the area where the deceased was killed, although he had no clear recollection of this. He said that he was intoxicated, having been drinking since around 8am. He denied striking the accused with the fence picket, although he added, “… if he deserved to go in there to hurt, to hurt your family, he deserved to get it….”. He described himself as “very protective … of my family …”.  
     
      
       
      
    28     Detective Senior Constable Rutledge saw the accused some time after 4pm that day at Kempsey Police Station, and he described him as “slightly to moderately affected by alcohol”. He said that the accused appeared much the same at the time the recorded interview commenced a little after 7pm, and I find this consistent with my own viewing of the video tape. However, he had earlier complained of pain in his ribs and left arm and was taken by police to Kempsey District Hospital, arriving there at 4.45pm. Hospital notes describe him as “heavily intoxicated” . I think it likely that he was substantially affected by alcohol at the time of the incident and, in particular, when he spoke to the ambulance officer.  
     
      
       
      
    29     This is significant in assessing the weight to be given to the evidence of that conversation. On the face of it it is incriminating, but it is curious that the accused would claim to have struck the deceased only with his hands when it was obvious from the injuries that that could not be so. It is possible, as his counsel submitted, that he was referring to the altercation in caravan 40. Although the accused did not say in the recorded interview that he hit anyone at that time, one of the witnesses (Jodie Doyle) described him and the deceased as “sort of fighting”. Ms Ridgeway believed that there was fighting inside the caravan as she could hear a lot of noise, including “things breaking”, consistent with there being an all-in brawl. As I have said, the ambulance officer was not sure that the accused had said that he did not mean to kill the deceased. In all the circumstances, I am not satisfied that what the accused said to that officer amounts to an admission of the killing. 
     
      
       
      
    30     The same must be said of the accused’s assertion in the recorded interview to the effect that the deceased deserved what happened to him because he had threatened the accused’s family, of whom he was protective. At the relevant time the accused might well have believed that members of his family who were present in the caravan were in danger, given John Wilkes’ evidence that the deceased was waving the knife around and, effectively, threatening everybody with it. 
     
      
       
      
    31     It will be seen, then, that there are four major strands to the Crown case: the accused’s motive to attack the deceased, given what had happened in the caravan; John Wilkes’ direct evidence that he had done so; the identification evidence; and evidence of the accused’s partial admissions to the ambulance officer and to police. As the Crown prosecutor rightly pointed out, these strands of evidence should be viewed not in isolation, but as a whole. She argued that each lent support to the other, so as to establish the accused’s guilt to the requisite degree.  
     
      
       
      
    32     There is no doubt that there is a substantial Crown case but, upon careful analysis, it is not the “overwhelming” case for which the Crown prosecutor contended. Who else, she asked rhetorically, could the assailant have been? Cross-examination in the Crown case explored the possibility that it was John or Robert Wilkes. I think that unlikely, given that Mr Slappendel knew John Wilkes well enough to distinguish him from the man he saw wielding the fence picket and given Ms Ridgeway’s evidence that Robert Wilkes remained in the caravan after the deceased fled from it. Scott Payne denied that he was the perpetrator and, on the evidence, it is also unlikely that he was. Two other men who had been in caravan 40 gave evidence but there is nothing to suggest that either of them was responsible for the killing.  
     
      
       
      
    33     However, it appears that there were a number of other men present. Four were referred to by name by some of the witnesses, and Ms Ridgeway spoke of seeing “a pile of Aboriginal men outside the van”, while fighting continued inside it. The appearance of these men was not explored in the evidence, although the accused said in the recorded interview that there were “plenty of people the same build as me walkin’ around there”. Given the evidence of John Wilkes to which I have referred about the deceased’s behaviour in the caravan, any one of those men might have been sufficiently outraged to have pursued the deceased and beaten him.  
     
      
       
      
    34     Be that as it may, it is no part of my function to search for alternative culprits. The only question I must determine is whether the accused has been proved beyond reasonable doubt to be the perpetrator. It is sufficient to say that he was not necessarily the only man in that caravan with a motive to kill the deceased. The evidence of John Wilkes implicating him is, of course, significant. One can imagine that that witness might initially have lied to the police in a misguided attempt to protect his brother. The fact remains that his evidence is seriously flawed. So is the identification evidence, for the reasons I have given, and I am unable to afford to the evidence of the accused’s partial admissions the significance for which the Crown prosecutor contends. Certainly, there is the gravest suspicion that it was the accused who killed the deceased. However, having carefully considered the whole of the evidence, assisted by the comprehensive submissions of counsel, I am left with a reasonable doubt about the matter.  
     
      
       
      
    35     I find the accused not guilty.

    THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONHIDDEN JFriday 31 August 2001 
     
     70077/00 Regina v Malcolm Robert Potts 
      
       
    Remarks on Sentence1     HIS HONOUR: In the nature of things, all those involved in the administration of criminal justice in this Court see more than enough of human misery. Nevertheless, the present case is as sad as I have ever encountered, either as a judge or a practitioner. 
     
      
       
      
    2     The offender, Malcolm Robert Potts, was tried before me for the murder of his father on the night of 4 May 2000 at the home unit where they lived at Beverly Hills. The jury found him not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. The alternative verdict had been left to the jury on more than one basis but the central issue in the case was substantial impairment under s23A of the Crimes Act. It is common ground that that is the basis upon which he should be sentenced.  
     
      
       
      
    3     He was thirty three years old at the time of the offence and is now thirty four. He has suffered from schizophrenia since his late teens. His parents and his two older siblings, a sister and a brother, also suffered from mental illness of one kind or another. His mother died of natural causes in 1992. His brother died of a drug overdose in the previous year. In 1986 his sister suicided by shooting herself. He was deeply affected by these tragedies, particularly the deaths of his mother and his sister. Indeed, it was after his sister’s suicide that he first exhibited the symptoms of his own mental illness. As a result of the crime which brings him before this Court, he is now the only surviving member of the family. 
     
      
       
      
    4     It is unnecessary to recite the details of the killing or of the deteriorating mental state of the offender in the days leading up to it. These matters were fully ventilated during the trial. Although the deceased had been his primary carer, the offender’s relationship with him had been ambivalent and marred by conflict. On the night in question he stabbed his father to death with a knife in what appears to have been a frenzied attack. On his account to police and to several forensic psychiatrists, there was a measure of provocative conduct on the part of the deceased, but it was not such as would give rise to such a violent reaction in a man who was in command of his mental faculties.  
     
      
       
      
    5     In evidence at the trial, Dr Olav Nielssen, psychiatrist, expressed the opinion that the offender’s behaviour was attributable to an abnormal state of mind because he was in the early phase of a relapse into his mental illness. He was on a regime of anti-psychotic medication at the time but the dosage was relatively low. In addition, he was using cannabis and there was evidence that it could reduce the effect of the medication. It appears from his psychiatric history that he had engaged in irrational and aggressive behaviour during previous exacerbations of his illness. Some of that behaviour had also been directed to his father. 
     
      
       
      
    6     The offender was educated to Higher School Certificate standard. His employment thereafter was inconsistent because of the onset of his schizophrenia, together with his drug and alcohol abuse. He was married but he and his wife were divorced in the early 1990s. There is a son of that relationship, now aged about nine. His former wife and son have visited him in custody, but he has had little contact with them since the divorce and I think it unlikely that he will have any meaningful relationship with either of them in the future.  
     
      
       
      
    7     The offender has a criminal record comprising entries for street offences, minor drug offences, some minor offences of violence, and in 1997 an armed robbery for which he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment. I have been supplied with an earlier report of Dr Nielssen, from which it appears that that offence also was committed during an exacerbation of his mental illness. 
     
      
       
      
    8     I do not think that the offender is a continuing danger to society. Certainly, the crime for which he stands for sentence arose from his relationship with his father and I think it unlikely that he would re-offend in such a violent manner. Nevertheless, it is necessary that he comply with an appropriate regime of treatment and avoid drug abuse. Dr Nielssen expressed his view in this way:  
     
      
       
        
         
         Mr Potts’ future risk to the community is dependent on the management of his psychiatric disorder, as relapses of illness have been associated with aggressive behaviour. If he continues to receive adequate treatment, and abstains from using cannabis and other drugs known to produce exacerbations of mental illness, his risk should be relatively low.  
         
        
       
      
    9     For this reason, it is common ground that there are special circumstances calling for a departure from the usual proportion between head sentence and non-parole period. It is essential that the offender have the opportunity of an extended period at liberty, subject to supervision and the sanction of parole. In the trial I was much impressed by the evidence of Ms Pamela Turner, a psychiatric nurse who had been monitoring his treatment upon referral from a regional Mental Health Team. No doubt, services of that nature would be available to him upon his release. 
     
      
       
      
    10     I have regard to what Dr Nielssen referred to in his reports as “the disadvantage experienced by the chronically mentally ill in prison”. I suspect that his period of incarceration will be a solitary existence. Indeed, I doubt that that situation will improve significantly upon his release. Fortunately, he has a measure of financial security because of an inheritance from his mother’s estate, which is being managed by a trustee. 
     
      
       
      
    11     I was informed from the Bar table that, before the trial, the offender had conveyed to the Crown through his legal representatives his preparedness to plead guilty to manslaughter in satisfaction of the indictment. In fact, the offer was made after the legal representatives had received Dr Nielssen’s report, which supported the defence of substantial impairment. At the trial there was no issue that the offender had caused the death of the deceased, and evidence and addresses were directed primarily to the question of substantial impairment, although also to provocation. While he did not plead guilty to manslaughter when arraigned at the outset of the trial, he is entitled to the benefit of his offer of that plea in accordance with the observations of Grove J (with whom Spigelman CJ and Sully J agreed) in R v Oinonen [1999] NSWCCA 310 at paras 11-18. But for that offer, I would have considered a sentence of nine years in prison appropriate. I shall reduce that by roughly twenty per cent to seven years. 
     
      
       
      
    12     Malcolm Robert Potts, you are sentenced to imprisonment for seven years to date from 5 May 2000, the date you were taken into custody, with a non-parole period of three years and nine months. You will be eligible for release on parole on 5 February 2004.

    THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONSIMPSON J31 August 200170033/01 
     
     REGINA v Maryanne Jane COOPER 
     
     
     SENTENCE 
     
     
      
     
     
      
      HER HONOUR : 
      
    1    Maryanne Jane Cooper appears for sentence following her plea of guilty to an indictment charging her with the offence shortly known as infanticide. Both the Crown and Ms Cooper’s legal representatives have helpfully provided to me, in Chambers, the evidentiary and other material relevant to sentence. I have read this material, and, having considered the oral submissions put to me this morning, I am in a position to proceed immediately to sentence. 
     
      
    2    The offence of infanticide is created by s 22A of the Crimes Act 1900 which was inserted into the Act in 1951. That section provides that, where a woman by any wilful act or omission causes the death of her child, being a child under the age of twelve months, but at the time of the act or omission the balance of her mind was disturbed by reason of her not having fully recovered from the effect of giving birth to the child, or by reason of the effect of lactation consequent upon the birth of the child, then, notwithstanding that the offence would otherwise have amounted to murder, she is to be found guilty of the offence of infanticide, and is liable to be punished as though guilty of manslaughter.  
     
      
    3    All conditions necessary for the application of the section have been met. Ms Cooper acknowledges that, on 24 June 2000, by a wilful act, she caused the death of her daughter Chloe, then aged seven months, and that, but for s 22A, that act would have amounted to murder. The Crown, for its part, accepts that the balance of Ms Cooper’s mind was disturbed by reason of her not having fully recovered from the birth of her child. It is therefore appropriate to sentence Ms Cooper as though she were guilty of manslaughter, not murder. By s 24 of the Crimes Act the maximum penalty applicable to the offence of manslaughter is imprisonment for twenty-five years. 
     
      
    4    I hasten to add that the Crown has very fairly and properly conceded, and indeed urged, that a custodial penalty is not called for in the present case. For reasons I shall shortly give, I accept that concession as properly made. I do not intend to sentence Ms Cooper to a term of imprisonment. 
     
      
    5    It is, however, incumbent upon the court fully to explain the reasons that this concession was made and accepted. Where the court takes an unusual course such as imposing a non-custodial sentence where the death of a human being has been caused the community is entitled to a full explanation. What must never be lost sight of is that, at the heart of this case, is the loss of life of a seven month old child. The loss of human life is something to be treated with utmost gravity. Where the life lost is that of a baby, completely defenceless, and at the hand of her mother, from whom she could ordinarily expect nurture and care, the obligation on the courts to signify its respect for the sanctity of life and to punish those who wrongfully take it is so much greater. I am fully conscious of previous statements of this court and other courts emphasising the importance of the recognition of the gravity of offences of homicide.  
     
      
    6    Equally, of course, I am conscious that s 22A was inserted into the Act as long ago as 1951 in order to recognise a perceived phenomenon relating to the effects, in some instances, of childbirth. The legislature then identified infanticide as a form of homicide having particular characteristics and a particular genesis which therefore justifies, in an appropriate case, a different approach to sentencing. This is an appropriate case. That the maximum penalty applicable is the maximum penalty applicable to an offence of manslaughter in no way negates the recognition given to the particular circumstances that go to make up the offence of infanticide. 
     
      
    7    I turn now to the facts. It seems to me that the picture will be presented most clearly if I approach the matter chronologically, beginning with the birth of the offender. For this purpose, the subjective factors and the offence itself may be dealt with as part of a single history. The facts I am about to recount are drawn from a variety of statements (of Ms Cooper and others) and psychiatric or psychological reports, the authors of which have taken detailed and consistent histories from Ms Cooper. There is no suggestion that any of the histories were in any way inaccurate or fabricated, or slanted in order to achieve a more favourable result. 
     
      
    8    Ms Cooper was born in Parramatta on 25 October 1978. Her parents separated before her birth. Her childhood was unhappy, marked by abuse and physical violence. Her mother entered another relationship, and a number of half siblings were born, some of whom, it seems, later engaged in abuse of Ms Cooper. At the age of twelve she was made a state ward and lived for some time either in state run institutions or in foster homes.  
     
      
    9    From about the age of fifteen she experienced auditory hallucinations, these being in the form of voices. She made no report of these to anybody. In about 1995, when she was seventeen, she went to live with her mother in Orange, in NSW, and this was not always harmonious. In that year she took an overdose of Panadol; in the following year she took an overdose of aspirin; later, in 1999, she took an overdose of Prozac, which had, by then, been prescribed for a depressive illness with which she had been diagnosed. There is also a suggestion in the materials that she had, on one occasion, cut her wrists. At times, Ms Cooper has denied that any of these events represented an attempt at suicide, but it is difficult to see them as anything else. 
     
      
    10    In about 1998 Ms Cooper commenced a relationship with the father of Chloe, but this relationship was also abusive. On 23 April 1998 Ms Cooper’s first child, Samantha, was born of this relationship. Shortly after that Ms Cooper was diagnosed as suffering from depression. She entertained thoughts of killing Samantha but fortunately was able to restrain herself. She was again diagnosed with depression, and it was on this occasion that the Prozac, of which she subsequently took an overdose, was prescribed. At some point she terminated (temporarily) the relationship with the father of the children, and lived for a time in a refuge in Broken Hill.  
     
      
    11    For a time Ms Cooper lived with Mr and Mrs Williams, members of the Salvation Army Broken Hill Corps. Also in 1998 she was reported to display “significant vegetative symptoms” and, again, significant depression was diagnosed by a psychiatrist. She moved between the William’s home, a refuge, and other accommodation. 
     
      
    12    On 15 December 1999 Chloe was born. It was very apparent that Ms Cooper was not coping well with the care of the two children. Samantha was then twenty months old. Within three months of Chloe’s birth Ms Cooper began to experience more intense auditory hallucinations. These involved voices telling her that she was not a good mother, that the children were not hers, that she should give the children away, that Chloe had never loved her, and that she should quieten the baby down. She also felt that people were able to read her thoughts. A nurse at the Broken Hill Hospital contacted the Department of Community Services, apparently expressing concern about the welfare of the family. Ms Cooper was at this time suggesting surrendering custody of her daughters, although she did not make a final decision to do so. 
     
      
    13    Five days after Chloe’s birth, on 20 December, depression was diagnosed, this time at the Broken Hill Hospital.  
     
      
    14    On 23 June 2000 Ms Cooper moved with the two children from the refuge in which they had been living into a house in Broken Hill. It was the following day that Chloe died. As is now known, Ms Cooper had, during the course of the afternoon, attempted to give the baby a bottle. The baby cried loudly, and Ms Cooper could not soothe her. She therefore put her hand over the baby’s mouth and nose and held it there until the child stopped breathing.  
     
      
    15    Ms Cooper telephoned her friend, Mr Williams, and told him that Chloe was not breathing. He told her to ring an ambulance and he drove immediately to her house.  
     
      
    16    Chloe was taken to the hospital but attempts to revive her failed. It may here be observed that, as the medical reports show, suffocation leaves few signs and is very difficult to establish. Chloe’s death may well have been recorded as attributable as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. 
     
      
    17    However, the following morning, Ms Cooper disclosed the truth to Mr Williams. She also confessed to Captain Rushbrook and his wife Mrs Rushbrook of the Salvation Army.  
     
      
    18    Police were notified and Ms Cooper was interviewed. That interview was electronically recorded and I have, in Chambers, viewed the recording. The interview took place over a lengthy period of time and Ms Cooper at all stages admitted that she had killed the child by putting her hand over her mouth and nose. Ms Cooper also went with police to her home and pointed out various relevant parts of the home and furnishings by way of explanation or elucidation of what she had said. That excursion also was recorded on video tape and I have viewed the recording. Two things of importance emerge with clarity from the videos. The first is Ms Cooper’s obvious and genuine distress, remorse and contrition. The second is her complete frankness with police. I would add that the police officer who interviewed her exhibited the utmost compassion in doing so, for which, in my opinion he deserves commendation. It can not have been a pleasant task. 
     
      
    19    Ms Cooper remained in custody in Broken Hill until 6 July, when she was transferred to the Mulawa Women’s Prison. There she remained until 24 August when she was granted bail and admitted to the Bloomfield Psychiatric Hospital. From 9 September until 2 November she was resident at Endeavour House. On the latter date she was discharged from there, and, so far as I can tell from the materials provided and until I was provided with further information this morning, she has been on unconditional bail and at liberty since that date. This morning, I was told that she has taken up residence with her mother in Orange but she has recently been a patient at the Bloomfield Hospital again, she has been on unconditional bail since that date. 
     
      
    20    Since Chloe’s death Ms Cooper has undergone extensive psychiatric examination and assessment. In essence, reports of the various medical professionals who have examined her are unanimous although precise diagnoses, and some detail, vary. In my opinion, most of the variations are matters of terminology. She is significantly developmentally delayed. One psychiatrist assessed an intellectual impairment placing her in a borderline range of intelligence, and in the lowest three percent of the population in intellectual capacity. Her education is limited, and although she appears to be able to read and write in a rudimentary way, her skills in this regard are deficient. She has long suffered from depression, and this plainly intensified after the birth of each of the children. A specific diagnosis of depression was made five days after Chloe’s birth.  
     
      
    21    One psychiatrist, Dr Roberts, recorded a significant degree of Coca Cola consumption, suggesting that this may have resulted in a level of caffeine intoxication, but this has not been confirmed. All professionals who wrote reports used similar language in describing Ms Cooper’s manner and behaviour: they described her emotional condition as “blunted”: one described her as “vegetative”. 
     
      
    22    There are also suggestions, not clearly made out, of schizophrenia. However, that need not be pursued, because there is ample evidence of depression of a sufficient degree to warrant the description “psychotic”.  
     
      
    23    Ms Cooper was nineteen years of age when Samantha was born, just over twenty-one when Chloe was born. It was well recognised among her acquaintances that she was having grave difficulty coping with her maternal obligations. She was obliged to leave the refuge where she had been accommodated and move to the Housing Commission flat in which Chloe died. This happened only the day before the death. Although there is no psychiatric evidence to that effect, the stress of moving is well known, and, indeed, there is evidence that she resisted the move and wished to stay longer at the refuge. I imply no criticism of those who manage the refuge, or of any of Ms Cooper’s acquaintances, but, I am satisfied that moving into accommodation where she was the sole adult, with total care of two babies, created a stress with which she could not cope.  
     
      
    24    This is a tragic case. The life of a child has been lost almost before it began. That happened in circumstances where little real culpability can be attributed to the perpetrator. It happened because Ms Cooper lacked the resources - mainly emotional, but also intellectual and probably financial - to manage the family for whom she was responsible.  
     
      
    25    I wish to make it clear also that I do not intend to criticise the level of assistance Ms Cooper received from welfare or health authorities. It is, apparently tempting to some, to cast blame on those authorities when tragedies such as this occur. There is no evidence before me that would support such criticism. So far as the evidence before me goes, those authorities acted appropriately, but were unable to prevent the tragedy. In saying this, I am referring to the immediate circumstances before and surrounding the death. 
     
      
    26    During the course of submissions, Mr Maiden, who represents Ms Cooper in these proceedings, put to me that, in part, this tragedy may be attributable to changes that have been brought about in the statutory provisions for persons such as Ms Cooper. He put to me that part 9 of the former Child Welfare Act has been repealed but that if that part had still been in operation, or some equivalent had been in operation, Ms Cooper may have been entitled to continuing supervision and assistance from the Department of Community Services. I am not in any position to make an assessment of this submission but it does have at least an apparent appeal. 
     
      
    27    It is obvious to me that, from the age of eighteen, Ms Cooper really was in need of continuing assistance of some kind but that this, if what I was told about the statutory position is correct, could not be made available to her. If so, it is a matter that perhaps should be the subject of consideration by the legislature. 
     
      
    28    I am quite satisfied that the Crown is on firm ground in accepting that a custodial sentence would be quite inappropriate to meet the circumstances of this case. I am satisfied that the community’s need to see justice done does not demand, and would not warrant, a custodial sentence. I accede to the Crown submission that the appropriate sentencing option is a bond under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. It is obvious that Ms Cooper will benefit from supervision and guidance of the Probation and Parole Service and I propose to make that a condition of the bond.  
     
      
    29    S9 requires that a bond contain a condition to the effect that the offender will appear before the court if called upon to do so at any time during the term of the bond and that that person will be of good behaviour and will inform the registrar of the court of any change in his or her residential address. Additional conditions appropriate to the circumstances of this case may be imposed. I do propose to make a condition of supervision as well as the obligatory conditions. 
     
      
    30    Maryanne Jane Cooper, in accordance with s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I make an order directing you to enter into a good behaviour bond for a period of four years. The bond is subject to the following conditions: 
     
      
       
      (a) that you will appear before the court if called upon to do so at any time during the term of your bond, and; 
       
       
      (b) (i) that you will be of good behaviour for the term of the bond; 
       
       (ii) that you will inform the registrar of this court of any change of your residential address and 
       
      (c) that by Tuesday 4 September you will report to an officer of the Probation and Parole Service at Orange NSW; 
       
      (d) that you will accept the supervision and directions of the officers of the Probation and Parole Service. 
       
      
    31    Maryanne Jan Cooper, pursuant to the Act, I must explain the effect of the order that I have made. You must meet your obligations to comply with the conditions of the bond or you are liable to be brought back before this court and sentenced. If you are suspected to be in breach of the bond, or likely to breach the bond, this court may call upon you to appear before it and if you do not, it may order a warrant for your arrest. 
     
      
    32    If the court is satisfied that you have failed to meet your obligations, the court may re-sentence, take no action, vary the conditions of the bond, or impose further conditions or revoke the bond. If the bond is revoked then all sentencing options are again available but I will just repeat to you the conditions of the bond. 
     
      
    33    Firstly, if the court requires you to attend, you must do so. Secondly, you must be of good behaviour for the next four years. Thirdly, you must tell the Court if you change your address. Fourthly, you must go to the office of the Probation and Parole Service at Orange no later than Tuesday of next week and, fifthly, you must accept the suprervision and directions of the officers of the Probation and parole Service. Do you understand that? 
     
      
    34    OFFENDER: Yes 
     
      
    35    HER HONOUR: If there is anything you do not understand, Mr Maiden will talk to you about it and make sure you do understand.

    Remarks on Sentence1     HIS HONOUR: The offender, Dallas Clint Nhummet Bolt, was tried for the murder of his mother at her home at Cambridge Park on 17 September 2000. The jury found him not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. He had pleaded guilty to that offence but the Crown prosecutor did not accept that plea in discharge of the indictment. At the trial there was no dispute that he had caused his mother’s death by stabbing her repeatedly, with the requisite intent. The only issue was provocation. 
     
      
       
      
    2     The genesis of the crime is to be found in the offender’s sad and disturbed upbringing, particularly his relationship with the deceased. This was fully ventilated in the trial and it is unnecessary now to recount it in any detail. For as long as he can remember his parents were heavy drinkers, their relationship was turbulent and frequently there were abusive arguments between them. It seems that his mother was the stronger personality of the two. From about the age of twelve the offender would leave home for periods because he could not tolerate his parents’ behaviour. On other occasions, when he came into conflict with his mother for one reason or another, she would order him out of the house. For some years, when the family was living near Port Macquarie, there were times when he “lived rough” on a beach or found accommodation in a youth refuge.  
     
      
       
      
    3     Not surprisingly, he came to the attention of the Department of Community Services. In a recent report, Mr Nick Hedstrom, an officer of the Department who dealt with him during those years, referred to the deceased’s chronic alcohol abuse and her lack of insight into how her behaviour, and that of her husband, might have been affecting the children. Mr Hedstrom wrote, “This pattern of living at home until things blew up, and then either running away, or being told to get out, appeared to develop and solidify through Dallas’ adolescent years.” He considered that “significant damage” had resulted to the offender’s relationship with the deceased and he concluded, “I do firmly believe that these factors caused him great pain during his formative years”.  
     
      
       
      
    4     Also not surprisingly, the offender’s education was disrupted and he left school before completing Year 10. He has had little employment. His mother was given to adverse comments about his lack of education and employment, either directly to him or to others in his presence. She would use expressions such as “useless” and “good for nothing”, often accompanied by expletives. He found her behaviour as inexplicable as it was hurtful. Predictably enough, personality testing by Ms Elizabeth Kusch, psychologist, who provided a report in February 2001, found that “he suffers profound feelings of inadequacy, poor self esteem, an intense fear of rejection and abandonment, social anxiety and mistrust”.  
     
      
       
      
    5     The offender was nineteen years old at the time of the offence and is now twenty. He has three older siblings, a sister and two brothers. No doubt, they also were affected by this dysfunctional household but, of course, that was not a matter explored in evidence. 
     
      
       
      
    6     It is against this background that the events of the evening of 17 September 2000 must be understood. Members of the family and a family friend had gathered at the home at Cambridge Park for a barbecue. The offender’s sister, Nicole was living at the home. There developed what was described in evidence as “an argument” between the deceased and Nicole about a matter which is not material for present purposes. In truth, it was a one-sided affair in which the deceased abused Nicole, who was reduced to tears. 
     
      
       
      
    7     The deceased ordered Nicole out of the home. It seems that Nicole suffers from a mental illness, and she was distressed and fearful at the prospect of having nowhere to stay. The offender was conscious of this and he remonstrated with the deceased, protesting that there was no good reason for his sister to be thrown out of the home and asking that she be allowed to stay. This was to no avail and, indeed, the deceased demanded that he also leave. She threw Nicole’s belongings (and, it would seem, some of the offender’s) out of the house. 
     
      
       
      
    8     A relative who had been at the barbecue offered Nicole and the offender accommodation at her house. Everyone except the offender and the deceased set off in search of a taxi. As there were too many people to be accommodated in one vehicle, the offender was prepared to walk to his relative’s home. He went into the house to collect a bag of belongings, where he was confronted by the deceased. She told him to get out and said, “What do you want in here, you fuckin’ good for nothing cunt?” As he put it, she was “just up in my face”, poking him in the chest and repeating her assertion that he was “good for nothing”. It was at this point that he lost his self control, mounting what can only be described as a frenzied attack upon the deceased with a knife or, possibly, two knives. I accept that he now has no adequate recollection of the stabbing, but the post-mortem findings speak for themselves.  
     
      
       
      
    9     He called the “000” emergency line to report what he had done, saying, “I killed me mum…”. The tape recording of that call portrays a young man in a state of high emotion, primarily anger, but with some sense of the enormity of his actions. Among other things, he said that he had “had enough”. When asked by the operator what made him do it, he replied, “Life made me do it…”. He remained at the scene and surrendered to police when they arrived.  
     
      
       
      
    10     In assessing the gravity of the crime, it is appropriate that I have regard to the three matters relating to provocation manslaughter set out by Hunt CJ at CL in R v Alexander (1994) 78 ACrim R 141 at 144. In all the circumstances, I consider that the degree of provocation was high. As the Chief Judge pointed out in Alexander (also at 144), “The courts must of course recognise that a long course of conduct by the deceased may often be far more provocative than an isolated incident….”. The offender’s loss of self control followed immediately upon the deceased’s provocative conduct on the occasion in question. It could fairly be said that the degree of violence he displayed was excessive, although one wonders how much weight can be given to this factor when an offender has necessarily lost self control so far as to form the intent requisite for murder.  
     
      
       
      
    11     As one would expect, given his background, the offender has a record of previous offences, almost all of which were dealt with in Children’s Courts. They comprise street offences, a minor drug offence, some offences of dishonesty and some of violence. I have been supplied with the facts of two violent incidents in which he was involved, in both of which he displayed a considerable measure of aggression, both verbal and physical. One incident, when he was sixteen years old, led to his being charged with malicious wounding. The victim was a man who had been involved in an argument with the offender’s father. Among other things, the offender chased that man with a knife and cut his hand. In the other incident, when he was aged seventeen, he was involved with three other young men in a violent confrontation with police, which resulted in his being charged with affray. 
     
      
       
      
    12     Disturbing as these incidents are, their circumstances do not lead me to conclude that the offender is a continuing danger to the community. In particular, I see the extreme violence which he visited upon his mother as arising from his family background and his relationship with her, and I think it most unlikely that he would re-offend in that way. I have the benefit of a recent psychiatric report from Dr Olav Nielssen, and I agree with his observation that the offender “is more damaged than dangerous”.  
     
      
       
      
    13     This is not to deny that much needs to be done to foster his rehabilitation. He has a history of alcohol and drug abuse, and Dr Nielssen emphasised the importance of addressing that matter to minimise the risk of his re-offending. The doctor saw that end as dependent also upon his response to counselling and his progress in educational and vocational training. Ms Kusch, the psychologist, was of the same view, referring particularly to psychotherapy aimed at anger management.  
     
      
       
      
    14     Fortunately, that process has begun since the offender has been in custody. Following a suicide attempt, he was admitted to the Kevin Waller Therapeutic Unit at Long Bay. There he came under the care, among others, of Mr Gavin Wesson, psychologist. Mr Wesson gave evidence in the sentence proceedings, and I have found his frankness and insight of great assistance. Over time, the offender has responded to counselling, avoiding conflict with other inmates and developing trust in the staff of the unit and, selectively, in his fellow prisoners. He has also been furthering his education, albeit at a fairly basic level. I trust that he will continue to have the benefit of these opportunities. I strongly recommend that he continue to be counselled, particularly with an eye to drug and alcohol abuse and anger management. 
     
      
       
      
    15     Mr Wesson attested to the offender’s remorse for his crime, which I accept as genuine. He put this beyond doubt in the earlier period of his custody, when he was in a more disturbed frame of mind, by carving on to his chest the words “I’m sorry mum”. This is also demonstrated by his plea of guilty to manslaughter and the fact that the trial was conducted on the basis that provocation was the only issue. I was informed from the Bar table that no oral evidence was required at the committal proceedings and that the defendant’s legal representatives conveyed his preparedness to plead guilty to manslaughter to the Crown before his arraignment in this Court. He is entitled to the benefit of that plea of guilty, both as evidence of his remorse and for its utilitarian value, in accordance with the observations of Grove J (with whom Spigelman CJ and Sully J agreed) in R v Oinonen [1999] NSWCCA 310, at paras 11-18. 
     
      
       
      
    16     The sentence I impose must reflect the undoubted gravity of the crime, whilst giving appropriate weight to the offender’s youth, his disturbed background and his prospects of rehabilitation. But for his plea of guilty, I would consider the appropriate sentence to be imprisonment for seven years. In the light of the plea, and assisted by the guideline in R v Thomson (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, I would reduce that sentence to five and a half years: a discount of roughly twenty five per cent. Clearly, there are special circumstances warranting a departure from the usual proportion between sentence and non-parole period. The community and the offender would benefit from his being subject to supervision and the sanction of parole for a lengthy period. 
     
      
       
      
    17     Dallas Bolt, you are sentenced to imprisonment for five and a half years, to date from 17 September 2000, with a non-parole period of two and a half years. You will be eligible for release on parole on 17 March 2003.

    THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCRIMINAL DIVISIONIRELAND AJFriday, 7 September, 200170204/01 - REGINA v Leanne Charmaine ERIKSSONSENTENCE 
     
      
    1    HIS HONOUR: On 1 June 2001 the offender, Leanne Charmaine Eriksson, was arraigned on a charge that she, together with the co-accused, Paul Geoffrey Hill, on 27 April 2000 at Westmead murdered Tristen Michael Allen Lane, the deceased. To this charge pleas of not guilty were entered by both accused. 
     
      
    2    On 20 August 2001 the offender, Leanne Eriksson, was re-arraigned on a charge of manslaughter of the deceased, who was her son. To that charge the offender pleaded guilty. The Crown accepted that plea in full discharge of the indictment. 
     
      
    3    The basis upon which the plea of guilty to manslaughter was accepted, was that of manslaughter by criminal negligence on the part of the offender, in failing to obtain medical treatment for the deceased who had suffered injury and in failing to remove the deceased from the danger of injury by separating from the co-accused with whom she was in a defacto relationship. 
     
      
    4    It is agreed as between the parties that the first opportunity which the offender had to plead guilty to the charge of manslaughter was shortly prior to 20 August 2001 and that accordingly, for present purposes, hers is an early plea; R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) NSWCCA 309 (17.8.2000). It is further agreed as between the parties that the sentencing of the offender for manslaughter, by criminal negligence, should proceed upon the basis of certain agreed facts which may be summarised as follows. 
     
      
    5    Tristen Michael Allen Lane, the deceased, was born to the offender and Michael Allen Lane at King George V Hospital, Sydney on 1 March 1998. 
     
      
    6    He was two years and two months old at time of death. A few months after Tristen’s birth, the relationship between the offender and Michael Lane ended and they separated. At that time they also had another child, Joshua Lane, born 29 August 1995. 
     
      
    7    Following separation from Michael Lane, the offender maintained custody of the two children residing with them at various addresses including the home of her grandparents at Blue Haven on the Central Coast. 
     
      
    8    In February 2000 when the offender and her two children were residing at a guesthouse at 101 Queen Street, Ashfield, a relationship developed between the offender and the co-accused, Paul Geoffrey Hill, who at that time, resided with his sister, Amanda Hill, in a large block of residential units at Golden Grove Street, Darlington. The offender’s two half sisters, Julia and Shonna Parker and their father also resided in that complex of units. 
     
      
    9    At about that time Michael Lane took custody of the child Joshua. The co-accused Paul Hill moved into Room 19, 101 Queen Street, Ashfield where he resided with the offender and her son Tristen. A number of residents of those premises, a boarding house, from time to time overheard abusive language used by Paul Hill towards Tristen and heard noises consistent with the child being slapped, followed by Tristen crying. 
     
      
    10    On an occasion, about 1 April 2000, the offender’s half sisters Julia and Shonna Parker, who were acting as baby-sitters for Tristen, whilst bathing him, observed bruising to his body and in particular his head. When questioned about who had hurt him the child said “Paul, Paul”. 
     
      
    11    On about Friday, 14 April 2000 the offender, Paul Hill and Tristen moved in with Paul Hill’s sister Amanda to unit 50/11 Golden Grove Street, Darlington. At those premises on that day, an incident occurred in which Tristen suffered an injury. This incident was described by Paul Hill, to the offender, in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “I found him (Tristen) down the bottom of the stairs. When I picked him up I heard something crack.” 
        
       
      
    12    On Saturday, 15 April 2000 Tristen was taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital where he was diagnosed as having sustained a spiral fracture of the left tibia (lower leg). No other injuries were detected at that time. 
     
      
    13    On Tuesday, 18 April 2000 the offender left Tristen in the care of Paul Hill for a period of some forty five minutes while she went to the nearby shops. On her return she inquired as to how Tristen was and received, inter alia, the reply “I done something”. Upon further inquiry, the co-accused said “I couldn’t handle him crying. I threw him onto the corner of the lounge and he hit his head”. 
     
      
    14    The recounting of events in the material tendered makes it plain beyond doubt that Tristen’s condition deteriorated thereafter. By Wednesday, 19 April he was speaking very little and regurgitating such food as he was able to eat.  
     
      
    15    The offender said to Paul Hill that she wanted to take Tristen to the hospital. He told her that she would be blamed for Tristen’s condition and that the authorities would probably take the child from her and she would never see him again. The offender gave evidence that she was in fear of the consequences of taking Tristen to hospital and that for this reason she refrained from doing so.  
     
      
    16    On Thursday, 20 April 2000 the day appointed for Tristen to see a specialist orthopaedic surgeon at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, with regard to his fractured tibia, he was taken instead to the Royal Easter Show. On that occasion Tristen was observed by family members, who were also present, to be in a very poor state of health. He rejected food and was suffering from loss of mobility. Tristen’s condition did not improve over the Friday and Saturday and on Sunday morning, 23 April, he began fitting. He was placed in the bath and attempts were made by Paul Hill to give him cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. An ambulance was summoned by the offender and at about 10.50 a.m. Tristen was taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. 
     
      
    17    The offender, when spoken to by medical staff at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital said that Tristen’s injuries were caused by him falling down the stairs. Later that day Tristen was transferred to the New Children’s Hospital at Westmead. On 27 April a decision was taken to terminate operation of the life support systems. 
     
      
    18    The offender at that time provided various explanations for the injuries sustained by Tristen. They included: the incident on 14 April 2000 when Tristen was said by Paul Hill to have fallen down the stairs at 50/11 Golden Grove Street; an incident on about 16 April when Tristen is said to have fallen against a coffee table in the loungeroom; an incident on the morning of 23 April when Tristen was being placed in the bath and was said to have struck the back of his head on the bottom of the bath. 
     
      
    19    Those explanations, which are not consistent with the injuries sustained, were given by the offender at a time when she was concerned to protect Paul Hill and her relationship with him and to abide by his strong exhortations to her to distance him from contact with Tristen or of ever being left alone with Tristen in the event that she was questioned by persons in positions of authority. Her position changed when she became aware of the extent and nature of Tristen’s injuries, which were established on admission to hospital and at post mortem, as well as the realisation that Tristen’s injuries were inconsistent with events previously described to her by Paul Hill, together with admissions by him and with her own observations. 
     
      
    20    At post mortem, in addition to the fractured tibia, there were established fractures to the right humerus above the elbow and to the right seventh and eighth ribs, as well as the left scapula and clavicle. A number of abrasions, lesions and bruises were observed to the head, chest and limbs, as well as internal abdominal haemorrhaging. The direct cause of death was a subdural brain haemorrhage. 
     
      
    21    Dr Neil Langlois, the pathologist who carried out the post mortem examination, expressed the opinion that the bone fractures would have occurred on or proximate to 14 April 2000 when the left tibial fracture occurred. However, no other injuries were noted on examination of Tristen on admission to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital on 15 April when the tibial fracture was identified and a cast applied to his lower left leg. The fatal subdural haematoma may have resulted from two separate traumas or may have been the result of a re-bleed of a single traumatic incident which had caused a subdural haemorrhage. 
     
      
    22    The multiple injuries, including the fatal head injury or injuries, were inflicted over a period of ten to fourteen days prior to death. Their impact upon Tristen was such as to make it plain, during that period, to relatives and friends of the offender and to the offender herself that the child was in urgent need of medical treatment which was not afforded to him until far too late. 
     
      
    23    I am satisfied that none of the injuries sustained by the deceased was inflicted by the offender, who nevertheless must have been aware of their infliction and of the duty she owed to her child Tristen to seek urgent medical assistance and care. 
     
      
       
      The subjective considerations 
       
      
    24    Subjectively, the offender who is aged 24 years, was aged 23 at the time of these events. She was virtually abandoned by her natural parents as an infant and was brought up by her paternal grandparents, having no more than sporadic contact with her mother and apparently little contact with her natural father until her mid teens when she resided with him for some months. The helpful pre-sentence report furnished by Ms Patricia Webber of the Probation and Parole Service discloses that the offender left school in Year 9 and lived a transient lifestyle using her grandparents as the main support providers when in need. Her attendance at a TAFE college to further her education came to an end when she became pregnant having entered a relationship with Michael Lane, the father of her two children. 
     
      
    25    This relationship was volatile with numerous “break downs” attended by physical and emotional abuse of the offender by her partner. The offender terminated this relationship in 1998. The itinerant lifestyle which she and the children then followed led to her association with Paul Hill with whom she claims she was in love, believing these feelings to be reciprocated. The lifestyle of the offender and her children is thereafter accurately described by Ms Webber as both itinerant and chaotic for a period of less than three months continuing up until the commission of the offence. 
     
      
    26    Use of alcohol by the offender commenced when she was aged 12 years and was conceded by her to have been excessive at times, although not problematic at the time of the offence. She used cannabis at an early age but ceased all use when she became pregnant with her first child and has not consumed any since that time. For a period of time amphetamine use followed separation from her former partner but this apparently ceased in December 1999. 
     
      
    27    The offender’s criminal history is confined to two incidents of shoplifting which, for present purposes, are of no significance. 
     
      
    28    Her plea of guilty is of itself demonstrative of contrition and I accept the remorse she has shown in giving evidence as being genuine. 
     
      
    29    The offender subsequently to her recorded interviews with police, has made a statement and signed an undertaking to give evidence in accordance with that statement against the co-accused Paul Hill. She has affirmed this intention in her sworn testimony. The matters adverted to in the induced statement include direct evidence of conduct and admissions made by the co-accused which will be of significant assistance to authorities in what would otherwise be an almost wholly circumstantial case. 
     
      
    30    In this regard the offender is entitled to a substantial discount on sentence in addition to that referable to her guilty plea. R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243. 
     
      
    31    The offender is suffering from an incurable progressive genetically determined degeneration of the retina of each eye. This retinal dystrophy is described as producing tunnel vision, night blindness and blurriness. In the opinion of Dr F A Billson, professor of ophthalmology, University of Sydney, her visual function, absent recent examination, would be anticipated as presently being close to legal blindness which will deteriorate to blindness within the next decade. She also suffers from an overactive thyroid. 
     
      
    32    The report of Julie Hendy, neuropsychologist, of 27 August 2001 assesses the offender as extremely depressed and feeling seriously scarred by “… a traumatic event”, which I take to be the death of Tristen. The offender’s profile “… suggests a woman who is by nature submissive with a failure to assert herself in personal relationships”. I accept that the offender was not the dominant partner in her relationship with Paul Hill. 
     
      
    33    Whilst in custody the offender has been in strict protection which I assume to relate to the nature of the offence with which she was then charged. Future custody following the giving of evidence against the co-accused will be served in similar circumstances and be more onerous. I take this into account. 
     
      
    34    The likelihood of the offender re-offending is remote in the extreme, nevertheless the aspect of general deterrence in a crime as serious as manslaughter in the circumstances of this case dictates that a full custodial sentence be imposed. In R v Blacklidge  (NSW CCA 12.12.1995) at 4 Gleeson CJ said this: 
     
      
       
        
         “… the courts have repeatedly stressed that what is involved in every case of manslaughter is the felonious taking of a human life. That is the starting point for a consideration of the appropriate penalty, and a key element in the assessment of the gravity of the objective circumstances of the case. ( 
        R v Dodd  
        (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 
        ; R v Hill  
        (1981) 3 A Crim R 397 at 402).” 
        
       
      
    35    The Court was there dealing with a deliberate and willed act performed with intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm or with reckless indifference to human life. The degree of criminality evident in the present case, being founded upon criminal negligence, is certainly of less gravity. 
     
      
    36    The starting point in the present case, taking into account the matters to which I have made reference, including considerations of the health of the offender is a sentence of 6 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    37    The offender’s plea of guilty, her contrition and remorse and the utilitarian benefits which are important in this case warrant a discount of 17%. The proposed assistance to authorities is potentially significant and warrants a discount of 33%, a total of 50% reducing the sentence to 3 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    38    The offender has served 1 year and 18 days in custody before grant of bail for which she is to have credit. 
     
      
    39    In my view, there are special circumstances within the meaning of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999 which warrant a longer than usual period of supervision on parole and a lesser period in custody. These include: the offender’s prior good character; her youthful age; her family support; the onerous conditions under which she will serve her sentence and her medical condition. She will need to undertake parenting and personal development programs under the guidance of the Probation and Parole Service. 
     
      
    40    Leanne Charmaine Eriksson on the charge of manslaughter to which you have pleaded guilty and have been convicted, you are sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years deemed to have commenced on 20 August 2000 and expiring on 19 August 2003. There will be a non-parole period of 18 months deemed to have commenced on 20 August 2000 and expiring on 19 February 2002 on which date I direct that you be released to parole. I further direct that in addition to the standard conditions imposed by the regulations governing parole that when released to parole you undertake such parenting and personal development programs as the Probation and Parole Service deems appropriate.

     REGINA v Irena HATFIELD 
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
      HER HONOUR : 
      
    1    This is an application for a certificate under s 2 of the Costs of Criminal Cases Act 1967 (“the Act”). The section provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “2. Certificate may be granted  
         
        The Court or Judge or Justice or Justices in any proceedings relating to any offence, whether punishable summarily or upon indictment, may -  
         
        (a) where a defendant, after a hearing on the merits, is acquitted or discharged as to the information then under inquiry; or  
         
        (b) where, on appeal, the conviction of the defendant is quashed and -  
         
        (i) the defendant is discharged as to the indictment upon which he or she was convicted; or  
         
        (ii) the information or complaint upon which the defendant was convicted is dismissed,  
         
        grant to that defendant a certificate under this Act, specifying the matters referred to in section 3 and relating to those proceedings.” 
        
       
      
    2    By s 3(1) a certificate granted under the section is required to specify that, in the opinion of the judicial officer(s) granting the certificate: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings; and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) that any act or omission of the defendant that contributed, or might have contributed, to the institution or continuation of the proceedings was reasonable in the circumstances.” 
        
       
      
    3    By s 3A(1), the reference in s 3(1)(a) to “all the relevant facts” is a reference to such of the relevant facts as were established in those proceedings together with such further relevant facts as the defendant, on the application for the certificate, has established to the satisfaction of the court. 
     
      
       
      Background 
       
      
    4    On 19 April 1985 the applicant’s husband, Christopher Hatfield, was shot dead in the living room of the house at Maroubra that he occupied with the applicant and her two daughters from a previous marriage. A thorough police investigation followed but no charges were then laid. 
     
      
    5    On 13 June 1997 the applicant was arrested and charged with the murder. This happened because new information had come into the hands of police. That information came from a person, Atticus Busby, with whom the applicant had a romantic liaison during 1995 and 1996. Mr Busby told police that, during the course of their relationship, the applicant had confessed to him that she had murdered her husband; he also claimed to have made some tape recordings of subsequent conversations with the applicant in which he sought to steer the subject matter to the confessions, and have the applicant incriminate herself on tape. The tape recordings became an important part of the evidence in the Crown case in the trial that eventuated, and it will be necessary to refer their contents, and to the circumstances in which they were made, in more detail below. 
     
      
    6    The charging of the applicant generated a good deal of media interest. One consequence was that a number of other individuals came forward, who gave investigating police additional information largely about statements they claimed had been made by the applicant, and which may reasonably have been interpreted as incriminatory, at least when considered in conjunction with other evidence. Again, it will be necessary to refer in more detail to this material. 
     
      
    7    The applicant’s trial began on 3 July 2000. It finished on 14 August 2000 when the jury returned a verdict of not guilty of the charge. It is as a result of that verdict that the present application is made. The application is expressed to encompass costs, not only of the trial, but also of the committal proceedings and various ancillary and interlocutory applications that were made before the trial began. 
     
      
       
      The proper approach to ss 2,3 and 3A of the  
      Act 
       
      
    8    The rather less than pellucid prose in which the legislation is framed has resulted in some misapprehension about the intent of the legislature. However, early errors have been corrected, and the proper approach to an application for a certificate is stated by the Court of Appeal in Allerton v Director of Public Prosecutions  (1991) 24 NSWLR 550. At p 559 - 560 the court wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “We can see no support for the proposition reflected in these early decisions that a certificate under the Act is confined to cases where the Crown has had ‘sprung on it’ some new and unexpected facts which helped to exculpate the defendant and led to the acquittal. That is just not what the section says. Moreover, adopting that view of the section produces the undesirable result of confining the grant of a certificate under an Act, clearly designed to be reformatory and remedial, to a very limited class of cases. In accordance with orthodox canons of construction, the Act should not be construed in such a narrow way. 
        
       
       
        
        As we read s 3(1)(a) the task of the court or judge, justice or justices in specifying their opinion is indeed to ask a hypothetical question … that question is addressed to evidence to all of the relevant facts, whether discovered before arrest or before committal (if any); after committal and before trial; during the trial; or afterwards admitted under s 3A of the Act. All of the relevant facts proved, whenever they became known to the prosecution and whether or not in evidence at the trial, must then be considered by the decision-maker. The decision-maker must then ask whether, if the prosecution had evidence of all the relevant facts immediately before the proceedings were instituted it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings.” 
        
       
      
    9    To that passage may be added two paragraphs from Fejsa v R (1995) 82 A Crim R 253, adopting observations made by Blanch J in R v McFarlane (unreported, Supreme Court, 12 August 1994):  
     
      
       
        
        “It was not reasonable to prosecute, the judge said, merely because there had been a reasonable cause to suspect that the accused was guilty, thus justifying an arrest: Nor was it reasonable to prosecute merely because the usual test adopted by prosecution agencies throughout Australia had been satisfied - namely that there was a reasonable prospect of conviction: nor was it reasonable to prosecute merely because the magistrate (presumably with all of the relevant facts before him or her) had declined to hold, pursuant to s 41(6) of the  
        Justices Act 
         1902 (NSW), that a jury would not be likely to convict the accused. Nor was it reasonable to prosecute merely because there was at the trial (again, presumably with all of the relevant facts before the trial judge) a prima facie case to go to the jury, because such a decision necessarily disregards all of the evidence which favours the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        We agree with all that Blanch J said, and we would for ourselves add that, conversely, merely because this court enters a judgment of acquittal in favour of an accused does not mean that it was  
        not 
         reasonable to have prosecuted him, because sometimes that course is followed rather than to order a new trial if (for example) the accused has already served most of the sentence imposed upon him:” (p 255, italics in original; internal references omitted) 
        
       
      
    10    The judgment of Blanch J in McFarlane was also endorsed by this court in R v Pavey (1997) 98 A Crim R 396 and by Wood CJ at CL in R v Manley [2000] NSWCCA 196; 112 A Crim R 570. In the latter case Wood CJ at CL went on to say:  
     
      
       
        
        “It seems to me that the section calls for an objective analysis of the whole of the relevant evidence, and particularly the extent to which there is any contradiction of expert evidence concerning central facts necessary to establish guilt, or inherent weakness in the prosecution case. Matters of judgment concerning credibility, demeanour and the like are likely to fall on the other side of the line of unreasonableness, being matters quintessentially within the realm of the ultimate fact finder, whether it be judge or jury.” (p 573) 
        
       
      
    11    The final sentence quoted reflects the view taken by Hunt J (as he then was) in R v Dunne (unreported, Supreme Court of NSW, 17 May 1990), stated as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “it would, for example, be an unusual case in which it was held that it was not reasonable for the prosecution to allow a case to go to the jury simply because an issue of self defence - even a relatively strong case of self defence - was to be raised. Nor is it sufficient to establish this issue in favour of the applicant for a certificate that, in the end, the question for the jury depended upon word against word (leaving to one side the correct formulation of the onus of proof). In a majority of such cases, it would be quite reasonable for the prosecution to allow those matters to be decided by the jury. It would, however, be different where the word upon which the Crown case depended had been demonstrated to be one which was very substantially lacking in credit.” (pp 5-6) 
        
       
      
    12    The question that is raised by s 3(1)(b), concerning any act or omission that might have contributed to the institution or continuation of a proceeding may here be put to one side. That provision is directed to circumstances in which an accused person may, by making admissions or other statements indicating guilt, or otherwise, have led the prosecution authorities to bring the charge, or set them on a false trail (see, for example, Pavey, p 400), or has withheld, unreasonably (having regard to the adversarial nature of criminal proceedings), evidence that contradicts or casts a different light on the prosecution case ( Manley,  paragraph 78). It is not suggested by the Crown that either of those circumstances, or any other circumstance that would or might bring the sub paragraph into play, here exists. S 3(1)(b) is not material to the present decision. 
     
      
    13    The sole issue is whether, if the Crown had, at the time the applicant was charged, known all of the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to have instituted the proceedings. Determination of that question as it was argued will require an examination of much of the evidence adduced in the trial. It requires the court to consider, hypothetically, what would have been reasonable (more accurately, what would have been not reasonable) if knowledge of all relevant facts is attributed retrospectively to the Crown . 
     
      
       
      The application 
       
      
    14    The application is based substantially upon the attacks made upon the credibility of two Crown witnesses - Atticus Busby and Lourdes Pereira. That means that, if she is to succeed, the applicant must take her claim outside the general proposition stated by Wood CJ at CL in Manley (“matters of judgment concerning credibility, demeanour and the like are likely to fall on the other side of the line of unreasonableness, being matters quintessentially within the realm of the ultimate fact finder, whether it be judge or jury”) and within that stated by Hunt J in Dunne (“It would, however, be different where the word upon which the Crown case depended had been demonstrated to be one which is very substantially lacking credit.”) Indeed, the latter passage effectively encapsulates the basis on which the present application is made. It is, in a word, that the evidence of these two witnesses was “very substantially lacking in credit”) - so substantially lacking in credit that it was unreasonable for the Crown to have relied upon it; and that, without reliance upon their evidence, it would have been unreasonable for the Crown to have brought the prosecution. I would accept as correct the latter proposition, without the evidence of at least one of these witnesses, the Crown evidence would have been inadequate to sustain a decision to prosecute. I accept also, that, if it be demonstrated that, with the benefit of hindsight, the evidence of those witnesses was so substantially lacking in credit as to make it unreasonable for the Crown to rely on it, then, imputing knowledge of that lack of credibility retrospectively to the Crown, it would not have been reasonable to initiate the proceedings. 
     
      
    15    This is a convenient opportunity to dispose of one submission made on behalf of the applicant. That was that, had there been a conviction rather than an acquittal, it would necessarily have been set aside as (to use the terminology once in vogue) unsafe and unsatisfactory: Morris v R (1987) 163 CLR 454; M v R (1994) 181 CLR 487. Implicit in the submission was that, where a conviction is set aside as unsafe and unsatisfactory, the institution of the prosecution was necessarily unreasonable. A similar submission made in Fejsa was rejected by the Court, although the Court acknowledged that such a result does raise the issue of whether a certificate should be granted. 
     
      
    16    In any event, the submission is based upon a premise that a conviction would have been set aside on that basis. That proposition is, as will appear, in my opinion untenable. Senior counsel for the applicant referred also to the decision of the High Court in Latoudis v Casey (1990) 170 CLR 534. As counsel acknowledged, that was a decision as to costs of summary proceedings governed by the Magistrates (Summary Proceedings) Act  1975 (Vict). Mason CJ held that a court exercising the discretion conferred by that legislation to award or refuse costs should look at the matter primarily from the perspective of the defendant. Both Mason CJ and McHugh J emphasised that the award of costs was not made by way of punishment, but operated as compensation or indemnity against the expense incurred in defending the charge. Senior counsel urged that these observations justify a similar approach in relation to the legislation now under consideration. I reject that proposition also. As appears from the judgment of Mason CJ (p 538), the discretion there under consideration was framed in the most general terms and provided no guidance as to the matters to be taken into account. That is to be distinguished from the Act, which has explicitly stated the approach to be taken. It would not be a correct approach to the legislation to determine that the discretion should be exercised “primarily from the point of view of the [applicant]”. In my opinion the reasoning in Latoudis v Casey does not bear upon the construction of the Act,  or upon the discretion conferred by the Act. 
     
      
       
       
        
         • • • 
        
       
       
      
    17    It is necessary now to turn to the detail of the evidence given by the witnesses mentioned above. That evidence must be seen in the context of the evidence in the trial as a whole, as well as the other relevant material. Indeed, both counsel referred to the transcripts of proceedings other than the trial as evidence properly falling for consideration on this application. The evidence before me on this application included transcripts of a coroner’s inquiry conducted in June 1986, transcripts of committal proceedings, transcripts of a lengthy voir dire proceeding that took place by agreement before the jury was empanelled; and the transcript and exhibits of the trial itself. I do not pretend to have read all this material. I made it plain that I would read passages to which I was specifically referred, but that it was not feasible to read transcripts of other proceedings in an undirected or unfocussed way. Notwithstanding a significant volume of evidence produced by the Crown at trial it remains the case that the central, and essential, evidence was that of Mr Busby.  
     
      
    18    Mr Busby was sworn and began his evidence in chief during the morning of Wednesday 12 July 2000. His evidence in chief continued until the middle of the following day. During that time the tape recordings of the conversations with the applicant were played to the jury. Cross-examination began at the commencement of proceedings on Monday 17 July and continued throughout that day, throughout Tuesday 18 and Wednesday 19 July and for a short time in the morning of Thursday 20 July. Mr Busby was re-examined until mid-day on that day. His evidence therefore occupied five and a half sitting days. 
     
      
    19    The account that immediately follows is of his evidence in chief. It should not be taken as representing any findings of fact. Reference to the challenges made to his evidence in cross-examination will follow at a later point.  
     
      
    20    The effect of Mr Busby’s evidence in chief may be stated relatively briefly. He said that, at the age of twenty, he had adopted the name David Busby, abandoning the surname he had acquired at birth, and that a few years later he added “Atticus” as a first name. 
     
      
    21    In 1995 while working and studying law in Lismore, NSW, he met the applicant who was the director of the Regional Art Gallery. Despite a significant age difference, a sexual relationship quickly developed, although it did not continue uninterrupted. In the early stages of the relationship the applicant told Mr Busby of the death of her husband and showed him newspaper clippings reporting the death. For the purpose of the argument it is of some significance to note that some of the press reports included the (erroneous) assertion that Mr Hatfield had been shot four times. (He was, in fact, shot five times.) Early in 1996 the relationship between the applicant and Mr Busby broke down temporarily but a reconciliation took place in late May. It was during the course of the reconciliation being effected that the applicant confessed to the murder. An important part of Mr Busby’s account of the confession concerns the manner in which he claimed that she had made the confession. His evidence was: 
     
      
       
        
        “She held out her hand and she said, ‘I shot him’. She went ‘pow, pow, pow’ and she lowered her arm and went ‘pow’ again and said, ‘One for me, one for my mum and one for each of my daughters, Julia and Amanda’” (T 456) 
        
       
       
      (It is to be observed that, if taken literally, this suggests that four shots were fired.) 
       
      
    22    The following day the two met for lunch in a local restaurant. The subject of Mr Hatfield’s death was again raised. According to Mr Busby the applicant said that she should never have told him that she had killed her husband, and that if he repeated what she had said she would simply deny it. Again, that evening, there was a conversation to similar effect: the applicant repeated that if Mr Busby reported her confession she would deny having made it. 
     
      
    23    Shortly after this the applicant travelled to Sydney and from there telephoned Mr Busby. She said that she was not very comfortable about having told him of “her little secret”, that she was near “the Maroubra Rifle Range”, and that perhaps she should “get in some more practice”. She had previously told him that she had learned to shoot at the rifle range to prepare herself to kill her husband. In June 1996 the applicant visited Mr Busby at his home at Alstonville near Lismore. Mr Busby had by this time decided to go to the police with his information but felt, as the applicant had told him, that he was unlikely to be believed because an assessment of the credibility of his information would be made on the basis that it was his word against that of the applicant. He determined to engage the applicant in conversation about her earlier confession and to tape record the conversation. He concealed a voice activated tape recorder in the kitchen. Some conversation between the applicant and Mr Busby was recorded. The quality of the recording is hardly first grade, but technological means have been used to enhance it, and, ultimately, there was no dispute as to what was recorded on the tape. Extracts of the agreed transcript is annexed to this judgment and marked A. 
     
      
    24    On 27 October Mr Busby again invited the applicant to his home and again recorded the conversation that took place. The (undisputed) extracts of transcript of that conversation is Annexure B. Mr Busby then contacted Lismore Police, telling them of the conversations. He gave them the two tape recordings. In January 1997, at the behest of police, he visited the applicant at her home at Clunes, where he engaged her in further conversation. On this occasion the conversation was recorded by a listening device installed by police on the authority of a warrant issued under the provisions of the Listening Devices Act 1984.  
     
      
    25    There was other significant evidence in the Crown case. Ms Lourdes Periera gave evidence that she had met the applicant in about 1992 when both women were working for an Aboriginal community on Elcho Island off the northern coast of mainland Australia. She spoke of an occasion when a party was held in the applicant’s room. Although the island was usually alcohol free, on this occasion some liquor was present and was consumed. Ms Periera was not among those who drank it. She did not think anybody drank to excess. Ms Periera said that the party had begun to break up, that she was sitting on the floor when the applicant approached her, touched her on the shoulder and, apropos of nothing, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “‘You know what, I killed my husband … With three bullets … With a bullet right here [indicating the middle of her forehead] … One for me, one for my daughter and one for my mum and Dad’.” (T 300) 
        
       
       
      
    26    Ms Periera said that she mentioned this occurrence to three other people (whom she named) who also worked on the island, but otherwise did nothing about it until 1996 or 1997, after the applicant’s arrest, when she saw a television program that featured footage of the applicant’s face which Ms Periera recognised; and, a little later, two newspaper reports of the arrest. Of the second of these she said that she could not bring herself to read it. 
     
      
    27    Another group of witnesses were from the Lismore area and had come to know the applicant after she took up her employment at the Art Gallery in 1995. Ms Wilma Crowther gave evidence that she met the applicant in 1995. She also knew Mr Busby. On 12 November 1995 Ms Crowther held a barbecue at her home. The applicant and Mr Busby were among the guests. Ms Crowther said that, during a conversation about difficulties in her personal and domestic life that she had encountered that year, she made a reference to the absence of support from her husband. According to her evidence the accused responded by saying “shoot him” and then saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “Pow, pow, pow. I’d shoot him … One for your mother, one for your children, and one for you.” (T416) 
        
       
       
      She said that the word “pow” was used four times. She thought this was said in “light hearted”, joking way. 
       
      
    28    Ms Crowther also gave evidence that she and her husband attended a dinner party at the applicant’s home in early June 1997. This was about a week before the applicant was charged with the murder. She said the conversation turned to Christopher Hatfield and that, in answer to a question she asked, the applicant told her that Mr Hatfield had died in a car accident on his way to work.  
     
      
    29    Ms Nora Vidler-Blanksby gave evidence of meeting the applicant and Mr Busby for the first time at the barbecue at Ms Crowther’s home in November 1995. She was present during the conversation recounted by Ms Crowther although her recollection of it was slightly different. Her evidence was: 
     
      
       
        
        “I heard the words ‘pow, pow, pow’ which was followed by ‘I’d shoot, I’d shoot him. I killed him’ or ‘I shot him’, similar to those words”. (T427) 
        
       
      
    30    Ms Vidler-Blanksby was also present at the dinner party at the applicant’s home in June 1997, but, again, her recollection was different from that of Ms Crowther, this time significantly so. 
     
      
    31    In fact, Ms Vidler-Blanksby recalled that she herself had asked what had caused Christopher Hatfield’s death, but said that this was after the departure of the Crowthers. She said the applicant told her that her husband had been murdered, and produced newspaper cuttings of the reports of his death. Evidence given by Ms Vidler-Blanksby’s husband was substantially in accordance with that of his wife.  
     
      
    32    In addition to the evidence of these witnesses there was a good deal of evidence that had been gathered in and immediately after 1985. This dealt with, inter alia, the location of a gun together with a silencer that was in all probability the weapon used for the murder, in water not far from the Hatfield home; access by the applicant to firearms and lessons in shooting she had taken not long before the death; the nature of the relationship between the applicant and Mr Hatfield; the circumstances of the death of Mr Hatfield (the applicant was present in a very small house at the time of the death; she told police she had been upstairs, asleep, while Mr Hatfield slept in front of the television downstairs). There was more, but it is neither necessary nor desirable to detail it here. The evidence amassed by the investigating police in 1985 and 1986 was, admittedly, insufficient to justify charging the applicant at that time. It was the evidence of Mr Busby that prompted the charging; and the Crown case was supplemented by the later acquired evidence of the Lismore witnesses and Ms Periera. That evidence is therefore focal to the assessment of whether, if the Crown had had knowledge of all relevant facts at the time the charge was laid, it would have not been reasonable to have proceeded with it. In that assessment, the 1985 and 1986 evidence is not to be discarded; it is plainly relevant to the overall assessment required to be made. 
     
      
    33    I have not, in the outline above, made any reference to the cross-examination of Mr Busby or of Ms Periera and it is convenient now to turn to that. That is, in effect, the key to the application made by the applicant. The principal argument advanced on her behalf is that the cross-examination, particularly of Mr Busby, but also of Ms Periera, was so deadly, and made such substantial inroads into the credibility of those witnesses that, if the Crown had, at the time the proceedings were instituted, known of the effect on their credibility of the cross-examination, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings. The “relevant fact” for the purposes of s 3(1)(a) of the Act is, on the argument, the absence of credibility of, in particular, Mr Busby, but also of Ms Periera. 
     
      
    34    That makes it necessary to consider the credibility issues in relation to these witnesses; and that, in turn, will render it necessary to consider further evidence not already mentioned. 
     
      
    35    In the trial senior counsel for the applicant launched a sustained and concentrated attack on Mr Busby’s credibility. In summing up to the jury I referred to no less than thirteen individual matters which had been urged as reflecting adversely upon his credibility. It is convenient to use the matters there identified as the starting point in the consideration of the matters now raised. Some may readily be discarded as inconsequential. Many, if not all, of the matters raised in the trial were again raised in support of this application. 
     
      
    36    During the trial reliance was placed, on behalf of the applicant, on Mr Busby’s name changes. In my view, neither alone nor in combination with other matters, does this bear in any material way upon his credibility, certainly not at the time of the trial. The evidence was that the name changes were undertaken when he was a young man. There was other evidence, given in passing, that he had had a troubled early life with little parental support. Although the name changes may be indicative of a certain level of instability at the time they were made, they do not, to my mind, affect his credibility at any relevant time. There was no evidence that they were made for any dishonest purpose. Similarly, it was put that Mr Busby had a history of engaging in relationships with women older than himself, as he did with the applicant, and that this signified a willingness, even eagerness, on his part to prey on vulnerable older women. Underlying this submission are assumptions, quite unwarranted, about older women and younger men and relationships between them. The propensity, if such it was, of Mr Busby to engage sexually with women older than himself is not a matter that of itself affects his credibility. 
     
      
    37    Other matters raised, and relied upon for the purpose of the application were perhaps of more substance. It is convenient to deal with them as discrete issues. 
     
      
       
      (i) Mr Busby was extensively cross-examined about his record of drink driving offences. He has been convicted four times of such offences. This has some impact upon his credibility, but not, to my mind, to a marked degree, at least not in isolation; but associated with this was a matter of more concern. Mr Busby agreed that, in the years 1983, 1984 and 1985, he was convicted in Queensland of drink driving; and that, on the last occasion, he had been using a licence in the name of Kevin James Busby who was, in fact, a friend of his. This was, it seems, for the purpose of avoiding the potential loss of his licence (or more severe penalty) if he were again apprehended under his own name. 
       
       
      (ii) Another matter concerned an occasion when Mr Busby was charged with larceny. This was in 1985, in Victoria. He gave an explanation for the offence, which was shop lifting, to do with his need to obtain employment. However, he also agreed that he had not appeared in court as required, and that a warrant had been issued for his arrest. He had never returned to Victoria to answer the charge, nor surrendered himself on the warrant. 
       
       
      (iii) In about 1995 Mr Busby was employed by an environmental organisation in Lismore. On 26 September the employment was terminated by his resignation. It was put to Mr Busby that his resignation was precipitated by the fact that he had been found to have forged a cheque. On three occasions he declined to answer this question, or a question to similar effect, on three occasions, claiming the privilege against self incrimination. (Although the procedures prescribed by s 128 of the  
      Evidence Act  
      1995 were invoked on other occasions during cross-examination of Mr Busby, his refusal to answer questions on this occasion was accepted and the issue was not pursued.) There is an obvious inference available to be drawn, however, and I think, no matter what limitations may be imposed on the use to be made of such a refusal in other circumstances, it is available to be used for the present enquiry, which concerns the evaluation of Mr Busby’s credibility. Had the Crown known, at the time of the institution of the proceedings, that he would claim the privilege against self incrimination in relation to such a matter, that fact would have been relevant to the determination to proceed with the prosecution of the applicant. 
       
       
      (iv) Mr Busby agreed, in cross-examination, that he had in the past been a heavy consumer both of alcohol and marijuana. Indeed, he asserted that he had been an alcoholic, although this appears to have related to a much earlier time. However, during the time he was engaged with the applicant, he regularly used marijuana to the point that he had a dependency, although falling short, in his view, of addiction. He said that although he had told the applicant that he was involved in trafficking the drug between Sydney and Brisbane, this was not the truth and was said out of self-aggrandisement. He did, however, acknowledge that he had frequently given marijuana to others; and that, in the statement to police concerning his allegations against the applicant, he had asserted that he had never sold or supplied marijuana to any person. He agreed that the latter assertion was “a complete and utter lie”. This if known to the Crown at the time of the charge, would obviously have been a material consideration in the assessment of his credibility. 
       
       
      (v) Mr Busby was cross-examined about events that occurred in January 1997 and thereafter, concerning Mr Hatfield’s father, Peter Hatfield, after he had contacted police but before the applicant was charged. It is not altogether easy to untangle the evidence, but it seems that Mr Busby contacted Mr Hatfield senior, in order to tell him, also, about his allegation. He travelled to Sydney for that purpose and asked Mr Hatfield to reimburse him for his expenses. Mr Busby’s evidence in this respect was difficult to reconcile. He gave a number of unsatisfactory explanations for his request. He agreed that he had arranged for a cheque to be sent to Kevin James Busby. It is unnecessary to go into the details of this exchange; it is sufficient to record that, if the Crown had known of the answers Mr Busby gave to this line of cross-examination, it would have been material to the decision to proceed with the prosecution. 
       
       
      (vi) It was put to Mr Busby that, on more than one occasion, he had threatened violence to other people. Specific allegations were made, which it is unnecessary here to explore. It is sufficient to say that Mr Busby either denied the allegations, or put a different complexion on incidents that were obviously recognisable to him. In my opinion the evidence does not permit any reflection on his credibility in this respect.  
       
       
      (vii) Other allegations were put to Mr Busby concerning transactions between himself and the applicant. I simply record that these involved the purchase of a Harley Davidson motor cycle, and Mr Busby’s reporting of the applicant to the Land Tax Office in respect of her alleged failure to pay Land Tax for which she was liable. Whether this cross-examination had any impact on the jury’s evaluation of Mr Busby’s credibility, I cannot say. That is immaterial to the present determination. I can only say that, for my part, I would not reach any conclusions favourable or adverse to Mr Busby. The evidence was left in a state of uncertainty.  
       
       
      (viii) Similarly, a major but collateral issue arose during the course of a voir dire, and was continued into the trial, concerning the disappearance, or removal, of counselling records from the Southern Cross University where Mr Busby was a student. According to Mr Busby, after the applicant’s confession to him, he had sought the assistance of the university counselling section, which maintained certain records. After she was charged, the applicant’s solicitors issued a subpoena for the production of these records, but the bulk of them were never produced. As it turned out, after a long and tortuous process of enquiry, the counsellor concerned had destroyed the records. On behalf of the applicant it was always put that the records had been destroyed at the instigation of, and, indeed, because of threats by, Mr Busby. Once again, it is impossible to know what the jury made of this issue, and it must be said that the evidence left open some suspicion that Mr Busby had a part to play in the destruction of the records. That is probably sufficient for the question to be seen as a relevant consideration (had the Crown been aware of the evidence that would emerge) in the assessment of Mr Busby’s credibility.  
       
       
      (ix) Finally, counsel for the applicant referred to a number of inconsistencies which emerged in the evidence given by Mr Busby in the trial. Again, I do not consider it necessary to detail the matters to which reference was made. There were inconsistencies, and there were issues upon which it might reasonably be inferred that the jury harboured doubts about Mr Busby’s evidence. All of this was relevant to the assessment of his credibility. However, I observe that the present exercise does not involve an attempt to analyse the jury’s verdict, or to investigate the reasons for its decision: it is a retrospective and, it must be said somewhat artificial, examination of the reasonableness of the decision to prosecute, factoring into that question evidence that was not, in reality, available to the Crown at the time it made the decision. 
       
      
    38    The reliability of Ms Lourdes Periera was another matter on which reliance was placed. I have outlined above what Ms Periera’s evidence was. I may here observe that, so far as I was able to assess her, she gave her evidence firmly and with conviction. She was extensively cross-examined and maintained her position. Nevertheless, three things are to be noted. Firstly, there was an inherent improbability about the claim she made - that, out of blue, for no apparent reason, and to a total stranger, the applicant made an unequivocal confession of guilt of murder. Secondly, her answers to cross-examination about the circumstances in which she came forward were confused, if not improbable. Thirdly, she claimed to have passed on the applicant’s remarks to three others who were working on Elcho Island at the time. Each of these persons was called as a witness in the Crown case, and each either denied having heard or been told of Ms Periera’s allegations, or at least any recollection of having been told of the allegations. Had the Crown had access to information about the doubt cast on Ms Periera’s testimony, that would have been a relevant factor in the determination whether to proceed or not. 
     
      
    39    One argument put strongly on behalf of the applicant concerned a recurring theme in the evidence of the various witnesses who spoke of the applicant’s account of her use of a gun. In each case reference was made, in one way or another, to four shots. This may have been by the use of the recurrent phrase “pow, pow, pow, pow”; or to the attribution of the shots to family members - for example “one for me, one for my mum and one for each of my daughters…”. The fact was, although it was, at the time of the murder, erroneously reported that four shots had been fired, five shots were fired at or into Mr Hatfield. The point that was made concerning this was that it could be inferred that all of the witnesses had derived their (erroneous) information from a common source, and that this, if appreciated at the time of the decision to prosecute (or to continue the prosecution) would have made further inroads into the strength of the Crown case.  
     
      
    40    Although I am of the view that the reliance that was placed upon this was excessive, it is, again, a matter relevant to a proper evaluation of the strength of the Crown case.  
     
      
    41    A further matter upon which reliance was placed was the assertion that, although the applicant was interviewed on a number of occasions by police, there was no single instance in which she had been shown not to have told the truth. This, too, is a matter that goes into the balance in the applicant’s favour.  
     
      
    42    In performing the hypothetical exercise required by the legislation it is necessary also to have regard to factors adverse to the applicant and strengthening the Crown case. These are also of considerable weight. Not the least of these concerns an early concession that was made by senior counsel then appearing for the applicant. That was that there was no challenge to the accuracy of the transcripts. 
     
      
    43    As can be seen from the transcripts, the applicant referred to occasions “where he [he being Mr Hatfield] bashed me” and “ I snapped”. She is recorded as saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “Like, and if that’s too big, I understand. You know? I understand. There’s plenty of people that have done stuff like that and have fuckin reformed … 
        
       
       
        
        You know, it was a long time ago and I’ve tried to live with it all this time …” 
        
       
       
      On the second tape, after Mr Busby had made a reference to “Chris”, the applicant said: 
       
       
        
        “Oh Atticus, I’d just come out of um, I’d just come out of um being pregnant, an ectopic pregnancy. My hormones were like all over the place. I wasn’t - I was in, you know whatever it is, whatever it is with that hormonal thing. I’d just been - just out of hospital a few weeks. It was not right, it was not right. It’s something that should never have happened …” 
        
       
      
    44    Perhaps most compellingly, there is a later passage on this tape, in which Mr Busby said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Let’s look at it. You, you shoot Chris, because you think he’s playing up. That’s what you told me, you know, that you think he’s playing up, so you shoot him …” 
        
       
      
    45    To this applicant replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “No, that’s not true. But anyway go on.” 
        
       
       
      The exchange continued:  
       
       
        
        Mr Busby: Well that’s what you told me 
        
       
       
        
        Applicant: That’s very oversimplified 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Busby: It is, it is..And you say this and I know sounds like) I’m … 
        
       
       
        
        Applicant: But why did you keep coming back to that?” 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
      Counsel for the applicant placed heavy reliance on an answer made by the applicant shortly after this in which she claimed never to have hurt anybody. This was put as material evidencing the applicant’s denial of the assertion made by Mr Busby 
       
      
    46    It is true that, in the passages quoted, and indeed, in the whole of the tape recordings, there is no unequivocal admission of guilt of murder. There are, however, substantial passages consistent with the account given by Mr Busby, and difficult to explain in any other way. The passage: “that’s very oversimplified” is different to construe as anything other than an agreement that she had made the confession attributed to her, but that the picture was more complex than might appear. 
     
      
    47    Another powerful piece of evidence that has to be factored into the equation was given by Mr David Heilpern. In 1996 Mr Heilpern was a lecturer in law at the Southern Cross University. In the middle of that year, he said, Mr Busby consulted him, looking “very concerned, worried”. Mr Busby then told Mr Heilpern that he could not cope, that he could not do his work, and that he had been given some information which he wanted to discuss in confidence. Having agreed that this could be done on a solicitor/client basis and therefore be in confidence, Mr Busby said to Mr Heilpern” 
     
      
       
        
        “My girlfriend has told me that she killed her husband.” 
        
       
       
      In response to an enquiry from Mr Heilpern, he said sometimes he did, and sometimes he did not, believe her. Mr Heilpern described Mr Busby’s manner at that time as: 
       
       
        
        “shaking, teary, he looked as though her hadn’t slept.” 
        
       
      
    48    This was, in my view, a significant piece of evidence tending to strengthen the Crown case. Certainly, in my opinion, it was a significant piece of evidence relevant to Mr Busby’s credibility, and counterbalancing some of the adverse matters that I have already mentioned. 
     
      
    49    Also put before me on this application was a transcript of evidence taken on a pre-trial voir dire. The applicant gave evidence in this proceeding. When giving evidence in chief, she was asked if she had said to Mr Busby words to the effect that she had killed her husband and she replied to this in the negative. In cross-examination she maintained that she had not told Mr Busby that she had killed her husband, and initially assented to the proposition that the assertion that she had was a complete fabrication on the part of Mr Busby. However, on further cross-examination, the following exchange took place: 
     
      
       
        
        “Applicant: During times of intimacy we would enter in role play and those sorts of things would be said during sex. 
         
         
        Crown Prosecutor: That you shot your husband? 
         
         
        Applicant: That is what would turn him on. 
         
         
        Crown Prosecutor: ‘I shot him I killed him’ and you say that that turned Atticus Busby on during role play, is that right? 
         
         
        Applicant: Yes.” 
         
        
       
      
    50    In a detailed cross-examination about the contents of the tape recordings the applicant gave an explanation that could reasonably be considered unlikely. This is yet another matter to be factored in to the evaluation of the “relevant facts” for the purposes of considering whether, in the light of all of the after acquired information, it would have been reasonable for the prosecution to institute the proceedings.  
     
      
    51    When all this evidence is taken as a whole, and notwithstanding the attack, substantially successful, on Mr Busby’s credibility, I am not of the view that, if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in possession of evidence of all relevant facts it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings. Removing the double negative, and putting the conclusion in plain language that nevertheless properly reflects the exercise I am to perform, and the conclusion I have reached, I am satisfied that, even if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in possession of all the relevant facts, it would nevertheless have been reasonable to institute the proceedings. Indeed, having regard to the seriousness of the allegation, and the strength of the corroborative material, I am of the view that to fail to institute the proceeding would have left the prosecution open to criticism.  
     
      
    52    Accordingly, the application for a certificate under s 2 of the Act is refused.

        COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION v Wayne BAFFSKY 
        
       
      
      
       
        
       The Respondent pleaded guilty to two charges of failing to furnish an income tax return contrary to s8C(1)(a) of the  
       Taxation Administration Act 
        1953 (Cth). He was convicted at St James Local Court and fined the one amount of $800 for the two offences. He appealed to the District Court arguing that the circumstances of the case were such that it was appropriate to apply the provisions of s19B of the  
       Crimes Act 
        1914 (Cth) (“the Act”) and dismiss the charges against him. Her Honour Judge Backhouse found that the circumstances were such that s19B should be applied and quashed the convictions against the Respondent. 
       
      
      
       
       Following an application by the Appellant, her Honour submitted several questions of law to the Court of Criminal Appeal for determination pursuant to s5B of the  
       Criminal Appeal Act 
        1912 (NSW). 
       
      
      
       
       Held 
        
        
       per Spigelman CJ, Simpson J and Einfeld AJ agreeing 
       
      
      
       
       Application of s19B 
        
        
       1 The application of the discretion in s19B of the Act consists of two stages. The first is the identification of one or more of the factors identified in s19B(1)(b). The second stage is the determination that, having regard to the factor or factors so identified, it “is inexpedient to inflict any punishment” or to reach the other conclusions for which s19B provides. 
       
      
      
       
       2 Section 16A(2) of the Act identifies the matters that must be taken into account in exercising the second stage of the discretion in s19B.

       Stated Case Questions: Whether irrelevant matters taken into account? 
        
        
       3 The Respondent’s professional status as a barrister falls within the definition of “antecedents” which is used in both s19B(1)(b)(i) and s16A(2)(m).  
       Cobiac v Liddy

       Jones v Morley 
        referred to. 
       
      
      
       
       4 The effect of a conviction on the Respondent is relevant to personal deterrence under s16A(2)(k), the issue of adequacy of punishment under s16A(2)(j) and the application of the test of “inexpediency”.

       5 The issue of bankruptcy as hardship can fall either under “antecedents” or under s16A(2)(k) in assessing the need to “adequately punish” the offender “for the offence”. 
       
      
      
       
       6 Contrition is expressly referred to in s16A(2)(f). 
       
      
      
       
       7 Reduced motivation falls within “health or mental condition” in s19B(1)(b)(i). It also falls within “physical or mental condition” in s16A(2)(m). In addition, it is encompassed by “antecedents”. 
       
      
      
       
       8 Her Honour did not take into account a consideration in the form of reduced motivation owing to bankruptcy. 
       
      
      
       
       9 The Respondent’s maintenance of his relationship with his son falls within the meaning of “character” in s19B(1)(b)(i). It is also encompassed by “antecedents”. 
       
      
      
       
       10 No submission on the part of the Appellant was addressed to whether “substantial interstate travel for work” was a relevant matter and therefore it is not appropriate to answer this question. 
       
      
      
       
      
      
       
      
      
       
       Stated Case Questions: Were relevant matters not taken into account? 
        
        
       11 Section 19B formulates a test of whether punishment is “inexpedient”. The Appellant’s proposition that s19B is not available under revenue legislation unless “exceptional circumstances” are found to exist is not supported by authority.

       12 The Commissioner submitted that the result itself was such as to reveal error. The summary statement of facts contained in the Stated Case does not permit the Court to determine this issue. 
       
      
      
       
       13 Her Honour failed to have regard to the issue of delay on the basis of matters which were not relevant to that consideration. Her Honour erred in this regard. 
       
      
      
       
       14 Her Honour’s references to the liabilities owing indicate that she did take the amounts owing into account. 
       
      
      
       
       15 Though general deterrence is not expressly listed in s16A(2), it is a relevant consideration for sentencing in Commonwealth offences.

       16 Her Honour’s references to the fact that s19B is not generally seen to be appropriate with respect to this kind of offence and that the offence was not “trivial”, are such that it can not be concluded that her Honour failed to take general deterrence into account.

       Second offence 
        
        
       Both offences were triggered by the Respondent’s failure to furnish a return on exactly the same day as required by a single notice issued with respect to two financial years. In these circumstances it was open to her Honour to consider the two offences together in exercising the s19B discretion.

        COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION v Wayne BAFFSKY 
         
         
        JUDGMENT 
        
       
     1    SPIGELMAN CJ: The Court has before it a case stated by her Honour Judge Backhouse QC pursuant to s5B of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Her Honour has submitted several questions of law for determination by this Court arising out of an appeal to the District Court by Wayne Baffsky, the Respondent in this Court, against the severity of sentences imposed on him at St James Local Court on 10 January 2001. 
      
       
     2    The Respondent was charged with two offences of failing to furnish an income tax return contrary to s8C(1)(a) of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth). Set out in the stated case are relevant facts found by her Honour relating to the charges against the Respondent. These are: 
      
       
        
         
         “(i) On or about 3 May 2000 at Bondi Junction in New South Wales the appellant failed to furnish income tax returns for the years ended 30 June 1998 and 30 June 1999 to the Commissioner of Taxation, as he was required to do on or before 2 May 2000 by a notice issued on 4 April 2000, pursuant to section 162 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. 
         
        
        
         
         (ii) The appellant made an application to the Commissioner on 28 April 2000 for an extension of time to lodge the required income tax returns. This request was refused by the Commissioner on 28 April 2000, who noted that the appellant had received a reminder letter before the notice issued. 
         
        
        
         
         (iii) The appellant furnished returns for the years ended 30 June 1998 and 30 June 1999 to the Commissioner of Taxation on 9 January 2001. 
         
        
        
         
         (iv) The tax which is payable by the appellant on his 1998 income tax return is $5,559.07. 
         
        
        
         
         (v) The tax which is payable by the appellant on his 1999 income tax return is $76,974.28. 
         
        
        
         
         (vi) The appellant was involved in a motor vehicle accident on 17 July 1998, which had the effect of aggravating an existing back ailment and also reduced his motivation. 
         
        
        
         
         (vii) The appellant was made bankrupt by the Commissioner of Taxation in January or February 2000. He has reached an agreement with his trustee in bankruptcy whereby he pays the Commissioner approximately $1,330.00 each month. 
         
        
        
         
         (viii) The appellant has been working interstate on a regular basis from at least June 2000 to the present time. 
         
        
        
         
         (ix) The appellant has devoted time to maintaining a relationship with his son, after the appellant separated from his son’s mother. 
         
        
        
         
         (x) The appellant has engaged in volunteer work in the past, in both legal and non-legal capacities. 
         
        
        
         
         (xi) The appellant has expressed contrition and remorse for the offences.” 
         
        
       
     3    In the Local Court the Respondent pleaded guilty to the two charges. He was convicted and fined one amount of $800 for the two offences. The maximum penalty for the first offence to which the Respondent pleaded guilty was a fine of $2,200; a fine of $4,400 was the maximum for the second. The Respondent appealed to the District Court. 
      
       
     4    On sentence, Backhouse DCJ considered whether the circumstances of the case were such that it was appropriate to apply the provisions of s19B of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (“the Act”) and dismiss the charges against the Respondent. Section 19B says, relevantly, that: 
      
       
        
         
         “(1) Where: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) a person is charged before a court with an offence against the law of the Commonwealth; and 
         
        
        
         
         (b) the court is satisfied, in respect of that charge or more than one of those charges, that the charge is proved, but is of the opinion, having regard to: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (i) the character, antecedents, cultural background, age, health or mental condition of the person; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (ii) the extent (if any) to which the offence is of a trivial nature; or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (iii) the extent (if any) to which the offence was committed under extenuating circumstances; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           that it is inexpedient to inflict any punishment, or to inflict any punishment other than a nominal punishment, or that it is expedient to release the offender on probation; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         the court may, by order: 
         
        
        
         
         (c) dismiss the charge or charges in respect of which the court is so satisfied …” 
         
        
       
     5    Her Honour referred to a number of factors in her consideration of the s19B application. She came to the conclusion that: 
      
       
        
         
         “Having regard to all those matters to which I have mentioned in the course of these reasons, I quash the conviction in respect of each of those offences and deal with the matter under 19(B) of the  
         Commonwealth Crimes Act 
         .” 
         
        
       
     6    In the stated case, her Honour summarised the process by which she came to the conclusion that s19B should be applied. She annexed her reasons for judgment which “listed the matters which I took into account” and referred to the following specific factors: 
      
       
        
         
         “(3)(ii) I indicated that I did not have recourse to that section on the basis that the offences were trivial. 
         
        
        
         
         (iii) I indicated I took into account the appellant’s lack of prior convictions and his positive good character, as indicated by the four character references, from members of the legal profession, which were before the court. Each spoke of him as a person of good character and, particularly, that he had, in the past, volunteered his services in both legal and non-legal capacities. 
         
        
        
         
         (iv) I also took into account the appellant’s age, forty-five years, and his health, he having been involved in a motor vehicle accident in 1998 in which he had exacerbated an existing back injury, and which had caused him a substantial degree of interference with his professional practice and lifestyle. I also took into account the aggravation to his back injury had reduced his motivation. 
         
        
        
         
         (v) I noted my concern that the appellant had not taken more prompt action in complying with the Notice issued by the Commissioner on 4 April 2000 but accepted that the appellant did make an application for an extension of time on 28 April 2000, which was ultimately refused on 28 April 2000. I also accepted it appeared that the appellant had been interstate on quite a regular basis during the period from at least June 2000 to the date of hearing. 
         
        
        
         
         (vi) I took into account, as a matter of hardship suffered by the appellant, the fact that he was made bankrupt at the suit of the Commissioner in January or February 2000, resulting in his reaching agreement with his trustee in bankruptcy to pay a sum in the order of $1,300.00 per month. 
         
        
        
         
         (vii) I also took into account the financial obligations which the appellant has in respect of his son and the fact that, notwithstanding his difficulties, the appellant has found time to maintain his relationship with his son. 
         
        
        
         
         (viii) I also took into account the fact that the appellant has indicated contrition and remorse to the court.” 
         
        
       
     7    The stated questions are as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “4(I) Did I err in law in determining that it was inexpedient to inflict any punishment on the respondent in respect of the first offence by: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) taking into account matters irrelevant to the exercise of my sentencing discretion in relation to an offence against section 8C  
           Taxation Administration Act 
            1953; and/or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) failing to take into account or give sufficient weight to relevant matters in the exercise of that discretion. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (II) If the answer to question (I)(a) is ‘yes’ were those matters: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) reduced motivation on the part of the respondent following his car accident; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) substantial interstate travel for work; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (c) the respondent’s maintenance of his relationship with his son notwithstanding a divorce; and/or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (d) the respondent’s reduced motivation owing to his bankruptcy due to his failure to pay provisional tax. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (III) If the answer to question (I)(b) is ‘yes’ were those matters: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) the length of the respondent’s delay in complying with the notice; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) the amount of tax owing; and/or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (c) general deterrence. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (IV) Did I err in law in categorising the circumstances before me as satisfying recourse to the provisions of section 19B  
         Crimes Act 
          1914? 
         
        
        
         
         (V) Did I err in law in determining that it was inexpedient to inflict any punishment on the respondent in respect of the second offence: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) for the same reasons as in respect of the first offence; and/or 
           
          
         
        
       
     (b) by failing to take into account the fact that it was a second offence.” 
      
       
     8    Questions 4(II) and 4(III) set out specific matters which may, if answered in a particular way, satisfy the questions posed, respectively, in Questions 4(I)(a) and 4(I)(b). However, they are not stated to be exhaustive. In certain respects the Commissioner submitted that a positive answer to Questions 4(I)(a) and 4(I)(b) could be given for reasons other than those set out in Questions 4(II) and 4(III). 
      
       
     9    There is a distinction between Questions 4(I)(a) and 4(I)(b). The latter, but not the former, makes reference to the weight which her Honour gave to considerations. Submissions asserting that insufficient weight have been accorded to particular factors must always be treated with reserve by appellate courts, so as not to interfere impermissibly with the exercise of a discretion reposed in a first instance judge. Nevertheless, an appellate court may, in appropriate circumstances, intervene on this basis. (Note the reference to “giving undue weight to any circumstance or matter” in House v The Queen (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 507-8.) 
      
       
        
       Irrelevant Considerations 
        
       
     10    Section 19B(1)(b) itself consists of two stages. First is the identification of a factor or factors of the character specified in subparagraphs (i), (ii) and/or (iii) of the paragraph. The second stage is the determination that, having regard to the factor or factors so identified, it “is inexpedient to inflict any punishment” or to reach the other conclusions for which the paragraph provides. 
      
       
     11    The issues raised under Question 4(I)(a) reflect these two stages. Are the matters which her Honour took into account capable of being characterised as falling within one of the subparagraphs? With respect to any matter for which the answer is in the negative, was that matter relevant to the determination by her Honour of the issue of inexpediency? 
      
       
     12    The New South Wales legislation, formerly s556A of the Crimes Act 1900 and now found in s10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, sets out the three paragraphs in substantially similar form as they appear in s19B(1)(b). However, in New South Wales there is an additional, wide-ranging factor as s10(3)(d): 
      
       
        
         
         “any other matter that the court thinks proper to consider.” 
         
        
       
     13    With respect to the first stage, s19B is, therefore, more confined than the equivalent State provision. The second stage of the process, i.e. the determination of “inexpediency”, arises in the same terms in both the Commonwealth and the State statutes. 
      
       
     14    The scope of relevant considerations is determined by s16A of the Act which provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “(1) In determining the sentence to be passed, or the order to be made, in respect of any person for a federal offence, a court must impose a sentence or make an order that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) In addition to any other matters, the court must take into account such of the following matters as are relevant and known to the court: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) the nature and circumstances of the offence; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) other offences (if any) that are required or permitted to be taken into account; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (c) if the offence forms part of a course of conduct consisting of a series of criminal acts of the same or a similar 
             
           character – that course of conduct; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (d) the personal circumstances of any victim of the offence; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (e) any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (f) the degree to which the person has shown contrition for the offence; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (i) by taking action to make reparation for any injury, loss or damage resulting from the 
               
             offence; or 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (ii) in any other manner; 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (g) if the person has pleaded guilty to the charge in respect of the offence – that fact; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (h) the degree to which the person has co-operated with law enforcement agencies in the investigation of the offence or of other offences; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (j) the deterrent effect that any sentence or order under consideration may have 
             
           on the person; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (k) the need to ensure that the person is adequately punished for the offence; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (m) the character, antecedents, cultural background, age, means and physical or mental condition of the person; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (n) the prospect of rehabilitation of the person; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (p) the probable effect that any sentence or order under consideration would have on any of the person’s family or dependants. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (3) Without limiting the generality of subsections (1) and (2), in determining whether a sentence or order under subsection 19B(1), 20(1) or 20AB(1) is the appropriate sentence or order to be passed or made in respect of a federal offence, the court must have regard to the nature and severity of the conditions that may be imposed on, or may apply to, the offender, under that sentence or order.” 
         
        
       
     15    Section 16A(1) extends between “determining the sentence to be passed” to encompass “the order made”. Section 19B provides for an order. That s16A encompasses such an order is confirmed by the express reference to s19B(1) in s16A(3). The scope of considerations relevant to the exercise of the power in s19B(1) encompasses each of the matters identified in s16A(2). These matters arise at what I have described as the second stage. 
      
       
     16    Other than by reason of the applicability of s16A, s19B(1)(b) is, relevantly, in the same terms as the equivalent South Australian legislation considered by the High Court in Cobiac v Liddy (1969) 119 CLR 257. In that case the High Court by majority upheld the exercise by the magistrate of the discretion. The majority consisted of a joint judgment of Barwick CJ, Kitto and Owen JJ and a separate judgment of Windeyer J. 
      
       
     17    Of relevance to the issues raised in this case is the treatment in the two majority judgments of one factor that was taken into account by the magistrate and which, in the event, the High Court determined had been permissibly taken into account. This factor was that the offender in that case who was 72 years old, had to look after his 87 year old sister who lived with him. The joint judgment said, at 265: 
      
       
        
         
         “There is room at least to doubt whether this last consideration was relevant either on the question of character or antecedents: but the case was not at any stage presented in argument on the footing that the learned magistrate took into account extraneous or irrelevant considerations in exercising his discretion.” 
         
        
       
     18    However the Court went on to hold that the conduct relating to the older sister was permissible to be taken into account on the issue of inexpediency. The Court said at 265: 
      
       
        
         
         “In our opinion, the magistrate was entitled to consider whether, having regard to the age of the appellant in the circumstances which included the penalties which he had resolved to impose on the other charges, penalties which included the fact that he would be disqualified for the rest of his life from driving a motor car, and having regard also to the fact that to send the appellant to gaol would subject him to distress by reason of his being there by prevented from caring for his aged sister, it was expedient to take the course described in s4(1) 
         I 
          rather than to convict him. In our opinion, there was material on which the magistrate could exercise his discretion in the manner in which he did.” 
         
        
       
     19    Windeyer J said at 276: 
      
       
        
         
         “The position of his aged sister was perhaps a matter which went more to the expediency of not sending him to gaol, and thus leaving her uncared for, than a matter comprehended by the statutory list of things which were to be regarded. But I see no reason for excluding from his ‘antecedents’ the fact that he was living with and caring for his sister, a woman of eighty-six years.” 
         
        
       
     20    His Honour went on to hold at 277 that the offender’s “good behaviour” in this respect could be considered “among his antecedents”. 
      
       
     21    The joint judgment in Cobiac v Liddy establishes that the list of relevant considerations for determining the issue of “expediency” is broader than the list of matters specifically listed as factors to which the court must have regard. 
      
       
     22    The breadth of the discretion is confirmed in the judgment of Windeyer J where his Honour said, at 276: 
      
       
        
         
         “… the magistrate must be of opinion that the exercise of the power is expedient because of the presence and effect of one or more of the stated conditions, namely character, antecedents, age, health or mental condition. One of these by itself, or several taken together, must provide a sufficient ground for a reasonable man to hold that it would be expedient to extend the leniency which the State statute permits. The Act speaks of the court exercising the power it confers ‘having regard to’ the matters it states. I read that as meaning more than merely noticing that one or more of them exists. Its, or their, existence must, it seems to me, reasonably support the exercise of the discretion the statute gives. They are not mere pegs on which to hang leniency dictated by some extraneous and idiosyncratic consideration. But they are wide words. None of the matters they connote is necessarily to be regarded in isolation from the others, or apart from the whole of the circumstances of the offender and the offence.” 
         
        
       
     23    This last reference to the “whole of the circumstances of the offender and the offence” opens up a wide range of factors as relevant to the exercise of the statutory discretion. It appears that his Honour, like the judges who signed the joint judgment, did not take a narrow view of the scope of relevant considerations, notwithstanding his Honour’s reference the need for one or other of the specified factors to themselves be of sufficient significance to justify the finding of the expediency. 
      
       
     24    There may be a difference in approach between the joint judgment and that of Windeyer J. (See Paterson v Fenwick (1994) 115 FLR 462 at 468-469). Windeyer J appears to apply a test that one of the specified matters must of itself justify the finding of inexpediency, but that in determining that question the full range of relevant considerations may be taken into account. The joint judgment proceeds on the basis that any matter relevant to the issue of expediency can be taken into account in the ultimate exercise of the discretion, whether or not that factor itself falls within one of the facts and matters specified in the respective subparagraphs of 19B(1)(b). 
      
       
     25    As a practical matter, there may be little difference between the two approaches because of the reference Windeyer J made to the “whole of the circumstances of the offender and the offence”, together with the broad approach his Honour took to the scope of “antecedents”. 
      
       
     26    Windeyer J’s reference to the relevance of “the whole of the circumstances of the offender and the offence” has been reflected in a number of subsequent decisions. (See e.g. Aikman v Bourne (1992) 63 ACrimR 467 at 470 per Cox J; McQuestin v Australian Securities Commission (1993) 2 TasR 30 at 36-37 per Underwood J.) 
      
       
     27    The broad approach to the word “antecedents” adopted by Windeyer J in Cobiac v Liddy, left open in the joint judgment, was subsequently adopted and extended by King CJ, with whom Jacobs and Mohr JJ agreed, in Jones v Morley (1981) 29 SASR 57at 63-65: 
      
       
        
         
         “The word ‘antecedents’ is ‘as wide as can be conceived’;  
         R v Vallett 
          [[1951] 1 All ER 231], per Lord Goddard CJ at p232. It s certainly wide enough to include all aspects, favourable and unfavourable, of an offenders background, past life, personal, family, social, employment and vocational circumstances, and of his current way of life and its inter-action with the lives and welfare of others. The hardship caused to others by a sentence of imprisonment, however, is not generally (although it may be in exceptional cases …) a relevant consideration for the sentencing judge … and I do not think that even the wide term ‘antecedents’ can comprehend the predicament of a person other than the offender if it is considered precisely as the impact of the contemplated sentence on the other person … . Nevertheless there are matters arising out of the dependency of the other person which may form part of the offender’s antecedents. He is entitled to credit for the self-sacrifice of unselfishness involved in his care for another. The domestic background is undoubtedly part of the antecedents. The distress which he will experience in leaving the dependent person uncared for is also to be considered … . Although not part of the offender’s antecedents, the impact of imprisonment on the dependent person has a bearing on the expediency of sending the offender to prison. The Court has to consider whether the character, antecedents, age, health or mental condition of the offender render it  
         expedient 
          to exercise the powers specified in the section. This depends upon ‘the whole of the circumstances of the offender and the offence:  
         Cobiac v Liddy, 
          at p276. A given set of antecedents may render it inexpedient to send an offender to gaol when considered in one context of circumstances, but not in another. In considering whether the matters listed in the section render it expedient to exercise the statutory powers, it is open to the Court, in my opinion, to compare the usefulness of the offender’s way of life and the harm to another which it averts, with the futility of a term in prison.” (Most references omitted; emphasis in original) 
         
        
       
     28    The breadth of the considerations that arise in this regard was emphasised by King CJ on the facts of the case before the Court, when his Honour said at 65: 
      
       
        
         
         “There are, moreover, mitigating aspects of his antecedents. He has experienced the death of a mother and two brothers, one from suicide. His two sisters and another brother reside elsewhere and the appellant has been left to care for an aged father who is almost totally blind and who is dependent upon him in a variety of ways.” 
         
        
       
     29    These authorities clearly indicate the breadth of the considerations relevant to the determination of inexpediency. For purposes of Commonwealth offences that breadth is confirmed by s16A(2). It is the matters identified in that subsection which a court exercising the power in s19B(1) must take into account. 
      
       
        
       Commissioner’s Submissions 
        
       
     30    The general thrust of the submissions by counsel for the Commissioner, with respect to Question 4(I)(a), was based on the proposition that her Honour approached the decision under s19B as if she were exercising a general unconfined sentencing discretion. By reason of my conclusion that s16A(2) applies to the exercise of the power under s19B(1), this criticism of her Honour’s general approach should be rejected. The discretion was not unconfined in the sense that her Honour had to apply a test of “inexpediency”. Nevertheless, the scope of relevant considerations is the same as that which applies to the general sentencing discretion for Commonwealth offences. 
      
       
     31    When making the decision for which s19B calls a court must first identify a factor or factors which are within the respective subparagraphs of 19B(1)(b). Thereafter, a court must have regard to this factor or these factors. Finally a court must take into account the matters set out in s16A.  
      
       
     32    The issue before this Court, with respect to Questions 4(I)(a) and 4(II) is whether or not an error of law occurred by reason of the taking into account of considerations irrelevant to the exercise of the discretion which s19B(1)(b) confers. The questions do not raise any other error of law. It is only if her Honour took into account considerations irrelevant to the exercise of the power she was exercising, that a positive answer to the question actually before the Court is permissible. 
      
       
     33    As I have noted above, with respect to this particular question, no issue of inappropriate weight arises. The issue is whether or not any of the considerations taken into account were not permissible to be taken into account. By reason of s16A(2), a matter which is not relevant under one of the subparagraphs of s19B(1)(b), may be relevant to the issue of inexpediency. For the reasons which follow Question 4(I)(a) should be answered: “No”. 
      
       
        
        
        
        
        
       Status as a Barrister 
        
       
     34    The Commissioner submitted that her Honour placed weight on the fact that the Respondent was a barrister and, on its own, this is not a factor which could lead to the favourable exercise of the discretion. Her Honour did refer to the Respondent’s professional status. It does not appear that she placed any significant reliance on it. It does not appear that any submission was made to her referring to the possibility that the recording of a conviction may impinge upon the continuation of his right to practice. Any threat to the Respondent’s right to practise could transform the moderate fine actually imposed into a substantial penalty. 
      
       
     35    The professional status of an offender is within the broad approach to “antecedents” to which I have referred. This word is used in both s19B(1)(b)(i) and s16A(2)(m). Furthermore, the effect of a conviction on the offender is a material consideration when exercising the s19B discretion. It arises both with respect to personal deterrence under s16A(2)(j) and on the issue of adequacy of punishment under s16A(2)(k). It arises generally on the application of the test of “inexpediency”. 
      
       
     36    The effect upon a captain of a ship of a recorded conviction for an environmental offence has been taken into account in deciding whether or not to exercise the statutory discretion under State legislation. (See e.g. Morrison v Peers (1995) 87 LGERA 39 at 42; see generally Thorneloe v Filipowski [2001] NSWCCA 213 at [57]-[112].) 
      
       
     37    Similarly, in McQuestin v Australian Securities Commission (supra), Underwood J took into account, in the exercise of the discretion not to record a conviction, that a conviction would have an automatic consequential effect of disqualifying the offender from occupying office as a director, under s229(2) of the Companies (Tasmania) Code. 
      
       
     38    The fact that a person is subject to additional adverse consequences by reason of the recording of a conviction is a relevant consideration in the exercise of the statutory discretion. The reason this is so was stated by Gleeson CJ in R v Ingrassia (1996) 41 NSWLR 447 when his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The essence of s556A is that it empowers a court which considers that a charge has been proved, in certain circumstances, to take certain steps ‘without proceeding without conviction’. The legal and social consequences of being convicted of an offence often extend beyond any penalty imposed by a court.” 
         
        
       
     39    It does not appear that the Respondent’s status as a barrister was taken into account by her Honour in this way. There is no reference in the Stated Case to the probability of any disciplinary action. (See O’Brien v Norton-Smith (MR) Pty Ltd (1995) 83 ACrimR 41 at 45-46.) Her Honour’s references to the Respondent’s professional status were not related to any such proposition.  
      
       
        
       Reduced Motivation Following Car Accident 
        
       
     40    Question 4(II)(a) asks whether it was irrelevant to consider reduced motivation on the part of the Respondent following a car accident. In par 3(iv) of the Stated Case the sentencing judge stated that she had taken into account that the “aggravation to his back injury”, occasioned by the motor vehicle accident in 1998 “has reduced his motivation”. 
      
       
     41    Counsel for the Commissioner submitted that such reduced motivation would only be relevant to the exercise of the discretion under s19B if the trial judge had formed the opinion that the Respondent had lost motivation to submit tax returns and that this constituted an “extenuating circumstance” within s19B(1)(a)(iii).  
      
       
     42    The Respondent submitted that the primary reason for the lateness of the returns was the motor vehicle accident of July 1998 and its consequences. He submitted that her Honour appears to have accepted the significance of the accident “as the prime reason for the offences”. The findings of fact in the Stated Case do not support this submission. 
      
       
     43    In her judgment, the sentencing judge said that the Respondent: 
      
       
        
         
         “… has had a period which it would appear, to extend at least from the date of his accident which was 17 July 1998, where he has had a substantial degree of interference with his normal practice, professional practice and also with his ordinary lifestyle.” 
         
        
       
     44    Her Honour also said: 
      
       
        
         
         “And finally on this question of hardship, returning to the motor vehicle accident in which he was involved which appears to have been no fault of his, but more importantly it had the effect of aggravating an existing bad back, and pertinently it has apparently reduced his motivation which I think is quite an important factor in this appeal.” 
         
        
       
     45    Nothing in her Honour’s reasons suggested that she linked the “reduction in motivation” to the failure to submit tax returns. The reference in the second of the two passages quoted above to “hardship” is equivocal. 
      
       
     46    The reasons for judgment do not indicate the sense in which her Honour used the term “hardship”. The passage quoted occurs at the end of a paragraph concerned with hardship, in which her Honour made reference to the Respondent’s bankruptcy, his agreement to pay a certain amount per month to the Commissioner, his obligations to his son and, then, the motor vehicle accident which aggravated his bad back and reduced his motivation. 
      
       
     47    It may well be that this factor cannot be brought within 19B(1)(b)(iii). That provision does not permit the Court to have regard to “extenuating circumstances”. The provision permits the Court to have regard to “the extent to which the offence was committed under extenuating circumstances”. This subparagraph requires some kind of link between the circumstance said to be extenuating and the commission of the offence. Nothing in her Honour’s reasoning suggests that she made any such finding. 
      
       
     48    However, the mental state of the offender in terms of reduced motivation could have fallen within s19B(1)(b)(i) which refers to the “health or mental condition of the person”. It would also fall within “physical or mental condition” under s16A(2)(m). Furthermore, the breadth of the word “antecedents”, as set out by King CJ in Jones v Morley quoted above, would encompass this consideration. 
      
       
     49    It is not appropriate to parse and analyse judgments given on an ex tempore basis by judges of the District Court, who have a considerable caseload. Although it is not clear to me in what sense her Honour was using the term “hardship”, reading her judgment as a whole, I believe her reference to the reduction in motivation can be accepted to be a reference to the “health or mental condition” of the Respondent and/or to his “antecedents”. Accordingly it could be considered under both s19B(1)(b)(i) and s16A(2)(m). I would answer Question 4(II)(a): “No”. 
      
       
        
       Substantial Interstate Travel for Work 
        
       
     50    In par 3 of the Stated Case the sentencing judge referred to her concern that the Respondent had not taken “more prompt action” to comply with the notice issued by the Commissioner upon 4 April 2000. It was in this context that her Honour said that she “accepted it appeared that the [Respondent] had been interstate on quite a regular basis during the period from at least June 2000 till the date of hearing”.  
      
       
     51    No submission on the part of the Commissioner was addressed to Question 4(II)(b). It is not appropriate to answer it. 
      
       
        
       Relationship with the Respondent’s Son 
        
       
     52    In par 3(vii) of the Stated Case, the sentencing Judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I also took into account the financial obligations which the appellant has in respect of his son and the fact that, notwithstanding his difficulties, the appellant has found time to maintain his relationship with his son.” 
         
        
       
     53    The Commissioner submitted that the maintenance of his relationship with his son may have been an appropriate subjective matter to take into account generally in determining what penalty to impose, but it was not a relevant matter for purposes of exercising the discretion under s19B.  
      
       
     54    The Respondent submitted that: 
      
       
        
         
         “Her Honour’s reference to this is a relevant finding of fact as to character that does not form the basis of her Honour’s application of s19B.” 
         
        
       
     55    This Court is not in a position to determine the weight which her Honour attached to this factor. Paragraph 3 of the Stated Case makes clear that her Honour did take it into account. 
      
       
     56    The word “character” appearing in s19B(1)(b) should not be given a narrow construction. In her Honour’s judgment the reference to the maintenance of the relationship with his son appears in the paragraph dealing with “hardship” rather than the paragraph expressly dealing with “character”.57    Her Honour’s observations were: 
      
       
        
         
         “… he also has found the time to maintain - which I think is a good thing - his relationship with his son.” 
         
        
        
       This appears to me to be a reference to qualities of the Respondent which could fall within the meaning of “character” in the section. In any event, it falls within the broad definition of “antecedents”, to which I have referred above. I would answer Question 4(II)(c): “No”. 
        
        
       Reduced Motivation Owing to Bankruptcy 
        
       
     58    Her Honour dealt with the issue of bankruptcy in par 3(vi) of the Stated Case where she said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I took into account, as a matter of hardship suffered by the appellant, the fact that he was made bankrupt in suit of the Commissioner in January or February 2000, resulting in his reaching agreement with his trustee in bankruptcy to pay a sum in the order of $1,300 per month.” 
         
        
       
     59    There was no reference in the Stated Case to her Honour taking into account any aspect of “reduced motivation” arising from the bankruptcy. On my reading of her Honour’s judgment she did not take into account a consideration in the form suggested by this question. Question 4(II)(d) should be answered: “No”. 
      
       
        
        
        
        
        
       Bankruptcy as Hardship 
        
       
     60    As noted above, her Honour said in par 3(vi) that she took into account the issue of bankruptcy “as a matter of hardship”. The Commissioner submitted that this may have been an appropriate matter to take into account in the exercise of a general sentencing discretion, however it was not a matter properly to be taken into account under s19B. The Respondent did not identify in his submissions any particular subparagraph on which he relied in support of the sentencing judge’s reasons. 
      
       
     61    The general issue of hardship and specific matters said to constitute hardship can, in my opinion, be relevant in two ways. First, as an “antecedent” on the basis of the broad definition of that word, as set out above. They may arise under s16A(2)(k) in an assessment of the need to “adequately punish” the offender “for the offence”. 
      
       
     62    Question 4(I)(a) should not be answered “Yes” by reason of this matter. 
      
       
        
       Contrition and Remorse 
        
       
     63    The Commissioner submitted that “contrition and remorse” was not relevant to the exercise of the discretion under s19B(1)(b). No specific question in this regard is asked in Question 4(II) of the Stated Case. The issue can arise under the general words of Question 4(I)(a).  
      
       
     64    In the Stated Case, her Honour said in par 3(viii): 
      
       
        
         
         “I also took into account the fact that the appellant has indicated contrition and remorse to the Court.” 
         
        
       
     65    The Respondent submitted that her Honour did not appear “to consider contrition and remorse in terms of delay”. That is not a pertinent submission. Her Honour states that she took this into account as a relevant consideration. 
      
       
     66    Contrition is expressly referred to in s16A(2)(f). 
      
       
     67    Question 4(I)(a) should not be answered “Yes”, by reason of this matter. 
      
       
        
       Failure to Take into Account Relevant Considerations 
        
       
     68    Question 4(I)(b) asks whether her Honour failed to take into account or give sufficient weight to certain matters said to be relevant to the exercise of her discretion. Question 4(III) identifies three such matters: 
      
       
        
         
         “(a) The length of delay. 
         
        
        
         
         (b) The amount of tax owing. 
         
        
        
         
         (c) General deterrence.” 
         
        
       
     69    The Commissioner’s submissions did not turn only on these three identified matters. No additional matter was referred to, however, the Commissioner did submit that the result was such that her Honour must have failed to take into account, or failed to give appropriate weight to, relevant considerations, including, but not limited to, the three matters, expressly referred to. 
      
       
     70    Counsel for the Commissioner submitted s19B is not available with respect to prosecutions under revenue legislation unless exceptional circumstances are found to exist and no exceptional circumstances had been established in this case. The absence of exceptional circumstances indicated that the discretion had miscarried in the way submitted. 
      
       
     71    The authorities on which the Commissioner relied for this wide-ranging proposition do not, in my opinion, support the proposition as advanced to this Court. The formulation of Jacobs J in Kelton v Wren (1981) 27 SASR 92, which was adopted by Yeldham J in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Wormald International Australia Pty Ltd (1985) 17 ATR 129 and by Wright J in O’Brien v Norton-Smith (supra) differs from that urged on the Court. 
      
       
     72    Setting aside, as Yeldham J did, the fact that Jacobs J made his observations in a context that s246 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) was then in effect (as set out in Kelton v Harris at 93), Jacobs J formulated the test in the following way: 
      
       
        
         
         “… there must be something that clearly distinguishes the circumstances of the offence under consideration from the typical offence, or circumstances of an unusual nature personal to the defendant, before [s19B] can be properly invoked in dealing with this particular offence.” (at 93)  
         
        
        
         
         and 
         
        
        
         
         “There must be something which clearly distinguishes the particular breach of the section under consideration from what may be regarded as a typical breach of the section.” 
          
         ( 
         ibid 
         ) 
         
        
       
     73    This terminology is not the terminology which the Commissioner urged on the Court in submissions in the present case. 
      
       
     74    Nothing further is gained from the formulation applied by Wright J in O’Brien v Norton-Smith, to the effect that the conclusion in s19B(1)(b) should only be drawn on the basis of “substantial reasons”. It can readily be accepted that “substantial reasons” are required. 
      
       
     75    As Windeyer J said, in the context of concluding that the then equivalent of s19B in South Australia applied to the offence under consideration in that case: 
      
       
        
         
         “The whole history of criminal justice has shewn that severity of punishment begets the need of a capacity for mercy. …[A] capacity in special circumstances to avoid the rigidity of inexorable law is of the very essence of justice.”  
          
         (Cobiac v Liddy 
          (supra) at 269) 
         
        
       
     76    See also R v Ingrassia (supra) at 449 per Gleeson CJ. 
      
       
     77    This general policy served by s19B is as pertinent to revenue offences as it is to other offences. The statute formulates a test of whether punishment is “inexpedient”. I do not see any warrant for replacing the statutory formulation with terminology as broad as “exceptional circumstances” in a particular sphere of regulation. This conclusion does not, however, cast any doubt on the importance of giving consideration to issues of seriousness, prevalence, difficulties of detection etc to which I will refer under the heading of “General Deterrence” below. 
      
       
     78    The Stated Case before the Court consists of a summary of the facts, the judgment and a statement of matters taken into account. The evidence before Backhouse DCJ included a number of documents, including character references, which contained information about the Respondent’s health and conduct. Such matters require qualitative assessment before it can be determined whether they provided a proper basis for the conclusion reached by her Honour. The documents on which her Honour relied are not before this Court. The evidence before her Honour was not annexed to the Stated Case. 
      
       
     79    This Court cannot, on the basis of a summary statement of facts, infer from the result itself that some error of principle must have occurred. A stated case is not an appropriate procedure to determine the general issue raised by the Commissioner. The three specific matters identified can, however, be determined. 
      
       
        
       Delay 
        
       
     80    The Commissioner submitted that the Respondent eventually filed returns nine months after the date of the notice and six and a half months after the letter advising that no further time would be granted. Nothing further was done, the Commissioner submitted, prior to the issue of summons. The returns were filed the day before the Local Court hearing.  
      
       
     81    In her reasons for judgment, her Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “… I was concerned as to why he had not taken more prompt action when he did receive notification from the Commissioner, which was in May of this year. He did make an application at that time for an extension of time which was ultimately refused, and it appears that he has been interstate on quite a regular basis during the period, at least June 2000 up until the present time.” 
         
        
       
     82    I note that her Honour’s reference to “May of this year” was in error. She should have said “May of last year”. Nothing turns on that. 
      
       
     83    The Commissioner submitted that these considerations could not explain the delay that has occurred and, by apparently accepting that they did do so, her Honour failed to take into account the extent of delay. In assessing this submission, the Court is confined to the facts in the Stated Case. 
      
       
     84    Delay was in my opinion a relevant consideration that the Court was obliged to take into account. It falls within the “nature and circumstances of the offence” under s16A(2)(a). 
      
       
     85    Plainly, her Honour averted to the issue of delay. That does not, however, necessarily mean that she gave it real consideration. The issue is a fine one. Did she conclude that the matter to which she referred meant that delay should be accorded little weight. Alternatively, did she conclude that by reason of the matters to which she referred, the issue of delay was not entitled to consideration? Whilst accepting that her Honour’s reasons should not be read over critically, I have formed the opinion that her Honour took the latter approach and in doing so failed to take into consideration a matter which she was obliged to take into account under s16A(2)(a). 
      
       
     86    The statement of facts states in par 2(viii) that “The appellant has been working interstate on a regular basis from at least June 2000 to the present time”. Although, no date in June is specified, this absence commenced at least a month after the offence, which was complete on 2 May 2000. 
      
       
     87    Her Honour referred to the application for an extension of time. On the facts before the Court that application was made on 28 April 2000 and rejected the same day. Compliance with the notice to furnish returns did not occur until 9 January 2001. This was more than eight months after the Respondent’s application for an extension was rejected. 
      
       
     88    I agree with the Commissioner’s submission that the considerations to which her Honour referred were not such as to deprive the delay which actually occurred of significant adverse weight in the exercise of the statutory discretion. Delay was a pertinent factor in assessing the quality of the offence committed. If the notice had been complied with within a short time after the date specified within it, the offence would appear in a different light from the point of view of s19B. 
      
       
     89    Her Honour, accordingly, dismissed a relevant consideration for reasons which were, in my opinion, inappropriate. This was not a matter of fact and degree. Her Honour failed to have regard to a relevant consideration on the basis of matters which were not themselves relevant to that consideration. 
      
       
     90    I would answer Question 4(I)(b) and Question 4(III)(a): “Yes”. 
      
       
        
       Amount Owing 
        
       
     91    It was submitted that her Honour failed to take into account the amount of tax owing. Her Honour did refer to the fact that the assessment for the year ended 30 June 1998 had been issued and the amount owing was in the order of “$5,000”. Her Honour expressly referred to the liability of $76,974.28 for the year ended 30 June 1999. Her Honour’s reference to these matters was sufficient to indicate that she did take the amounts owing into account. Question 4(III)(b) should be answered: “No”. 
      
       
        
       General Deterrence 
        
       
     92    It was next submitted that her Honour failed to take into account general deterrence with respect to revenue offences. There was no reference to general deterrence in her Honour’s reasons. Her Honour did, however, observe that the use of s19B is “traditionally … not seen to be appropriate for offences under any revenue legislation”. She repeated that such use is “generally not an appropriate course to be taken by the Court in relation to revenue legislation”. The Respondent submitted that this was, in effect, an acknowledgment of the significance of general deterrence in sentencing for these offences. 
      
       
     93    General deterrence is not expressly listed in s16A(2). However, the authorities establish that it remains a relevant consideration for purposes of sentencing for Commonwealth offences. (See e.g. R v Paull (1990) 20 NSWLR 427; DPP v El Karhani (1990) 21 NSWLR 370; R v Sinclair (1990) 51 ACrimR 418). 
      
       
     94    The significance of the conduct regulated by the statute which creates an offence is a consideration to which a sentencing judge must have regard in deciding whether it is “inexpedient” to impose punishment in a particular case. Such matters fall within “the whole of the circumstances … of the offence” to which Windeyer J referred in Cobiac v Liddy at 276 and within “whether it is expedient in all the circumstances”, to which the joint judgment referred at 265. (See also the “whole of the circumstances of the offence” in Kowald v Hoile (No. 2) (1976) 14 SASR 314 at 321 per Zelling J; Aikman v Bourne (supra) at 470 per Cox J; McQuestin v Australian Securities Commission (supra) at 36. 
      
       
     95    In Lanham v Brake (1983) 34 SASR 578 at 585, Cox J was concerned with the application of s19B(1) in the context of offences of bringing fruit into Australia contrary to the Quarantine Act 1908 (Cth) and the making of a false statement to a Customs Officer, in this respect. His Honour referred to the seriousness of the offence and said at 584: 
      
       
        
         
         “This is an area, in my view in which considerations of deterrence must predominate”. 
         
        
       
     96    Cox J also said at 585: 
      
       
        
         
         “In the case of these quarantine offences, the relevant considerations will include the seriousness of the offence, its prevalence, the obvious difficulty of detecting breaches under disembarking conditions in which its quite impracticable to examine the luggage of every passenger … .” 
         
        
        
       His Honour concluded at 586 that the magistrate “had insufficient regard to the intrinsic seriousness of this sort of offence.” 
        
       
     97    With respect to second appeal, involving the importation of chestnuts, Cox J again referred to the seriousness of the offences and concluded at 589: 
      
       
        
         
         “In my opinion, the learned Special Magistrate’s s19B orders, interpreted in the light of the facts before him and his own sentencing remarks, show that he must have failed to give sufficient consideration to the seriousness of the offences and the need to impose penalties that will act as a deterrent to others who are minded to commit similar breaches of the quarantine laws”. 
         
        
       
     98    On the basis of these authorities, the matters to which the Commissioner referred under the heading “General Deterrence”, are pertinent to the exercise of the statutory discretion. Her Honour made no express reference to any such matter in her judgment. This Court is reluctant to infer that a sentencing judge has failed to take into account a relevant consideration, only because express reference to it does not appear in the reasons. The judgment must be considered as a whole in order to draw any such inference. 
      
       
     99    Two factors indicate that this Court should not draw the inference in this case. First, her Honour referred on two occasions to the fact that s19B is not generally seen to be appropriate with respect to revenue offences and, in that context, expressly referred to the line of authorities on which the Commissioner relied in this Court, as before her Honour. Secondly, her Honour expressly found that the offence was not a “trivial” one. 
      
       
     100    I have not found this issue easy to resolve. It would have been desirable that these important considerations were articulated more fully. On balance I am not prepared to conclude that her Honour failed to take the matter into account. I am also unable to conclude, without access to the whole of the materials that were before her Honour, that the result itself showed that her Honour failed to give these considerations appropriate weight. 
      
       
     101    Question 4(III)(c) should be answered: “No”. 
      
       
        
       The Application of s19B 
        
       
     102    Question 4(IV) is in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “Did I err in law in categorising the circumstances before me as satisfying recourse to the provisions of s19B  
         Crimes Act 
          1914?” 
         
        
       
     103    The jurisdiction of this Court on a stated case under s5B of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is limited to a “question of law”. The question of law which appears to be raised under this particular question is whether only one finding was, in all the circumstances, open. (See for example Attorney-General (NSW) v X (2000) 49 NSWLR 653 at [56]-[63].) 
      
       
     104    For the reasons outlined above, the summary statement of facts contained in the Stated Case does not permit the Court to answer a question of this kind. The whole of the evidence before the first instance court would have to be annexed to the Stated Case. During the course of argument, counsel for the Commissioner accepted this proposition and did not press for an answer to this question. 
      
       
        
       The “Second Offence” 
        
       
     105    The proceedings before Backhouse DCJ were convictions for two offences of failing to furnish an income tax return, when required pursuant to a taxation law, contrary to s8C(1)(a) of the Taxation Administration Act 1953. The requirement was to furnish income tax returns for each of two years pursuant to a single notice issued on 4 April 2000 and to do so on the same day. 
      
       
     106    In her judgment her Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “There are indeed two offences in the technical sense, but each failure resulted in an offence and both matters were included in an Information and Summons before the court … .” 
         
        
       
     107    The Commissioner submitted that it was apparent from her Honour’s reasons that she failed to take into account that one of the offences was a “second offence”. Presumably the second charge on the Information being the second of the two financial years with respect to which a return was not filed, is the “second offence”. It was submitted that her Honour did not exercise her discretion separately with respect to that offence, taking into account the fact that it was a second offence. 
      
       
     108    In my opinion this takes an artificial approach to the hearing before her Honour. Her Honour’s reference to the fact that there were two offences “in the technical sense”, reflected the fact that they were both committed in the same constellation of circumstances which her Honour found to be relevant for purposes of exercising the discretion under s19B. Each was, in fact, triggered by the Respondent’s failure to furnish a return on exactly the same day, i.e. on or about 3 May 2000, as required by a single notice, issued to the Respondent with respect to two separate financial years. In these circumstances it was open to her Honour to consider the two offences together for purposes of exercising the s19B discretion. I would answer Question 4(V): “No”.

     3    SPERLING J: On 1 August 2000, the appellant was found guilty on two counts of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, following a trial in the District Court before Bell DCJ and a jury. The offences were alleged to have been committed on 9 October 1997 in the flat, at Taree, of the complainant, Ms Christine Gregan. The aggravating factor was a threat with a knife. 
      
       
        
       
     4    The appellant has appealed against conviction only. The grounds of appeal are as follows. 
      
       
        
         
          
          (1) His Honour erred in permitting the complainant to identify the appellant as the perpetrator in Court. 
          
         
         
          
          (2) His Honour erred by admitting evidence of a picture identification of the appellant by Rebecca Jane Goodridge. 
          
         
         
          
          (3) His Honour erred by inadequately warning the jury of the dangers of the complainant’s identification of the appellant in the courtroom. 
          
         
         
          
          (4) His Honour erred by inadequately warning the jury of the dangers of the picture identification of the appellant by Rebecca Jane Goodridge. 
          
         
         
          
          (5) His Honour’s directions erred by inadequately warning the jury concerning the dangers flowing from the complainant’s delay in reporting the incident to the police. 
          
         
         
          
          (6) His Honour erred by allowing evidence to be led from Ms Neal contrary to s157 of the  
          Criminal Procedure Act 
          . 
          
         
        
       
     5    The complainant gave evidence of the sexual assaults. She was not challenged on the substance of the evidence. There was also evidence of prompt complaint to friends and to sexual assault counsellor, Ms Ruth Neal. It was Ms Neal’s evidence that pinpointed the date of the offences. 
      
       
        
       
     6    The only serious issue at the trial was the identity of the offender. Identification evidence was given by the complainant, her flatmate, Ms Rebecca Goodridge and a friend of the complainant, Ms Jacqueline Townsend.  
      
       
        
       
     7    The appellant gave evidence at the trial. He denied ever having been to the flat and ever having met the complainant. He said that he was not in Taree in October 1997, that he was in Byron Bay for a period in 1997 which included October of that year. The appellant’s defence was that this was a case of mistaken identity. It was, of course, for the Crown to establish, beyond reasonable doubt, that the appellant was the offender. 
      
       
        
       
     8    Notwithstanding prompt complaint to the persons I have mentioned, the complainant did not report the matter to the police until 23 June 1998. There was, therefore, no opportunity for the police to obtain identification evidence for some time after the offences were committed. The police appear then, however, to have rested content with the complainant’s account of having known the appellant beforehand, with a view to leading that evidence from her in court. It was not until the trial had begun that the Crown took steps to obtain other identification evidence. 
      
       
        
       
     9    The indictment was presented and the jury were empanelled on 26 July 2000. That day was occupied by preliminary matters dealt with in the absence of the jury. In the course of the day, the Crown prosecutor asked counsel for the appellant whether the appellant would consent to taking part in an identification parade. The appellant’s counsel was told that, if the appellant did not consent, the Crown would seek to adduce picture identification evidence pursuant to s115 of the Evidence Act. Counsel for the appellant asked if he could obtain instructions. The trial judge allowed the appellant to leave the court room with his counsel. On returning to the court room, the appellant’s counsel informed the trial judge that his client declined to participate in an identification parade.  
      
       
        
       
     10    Asked if there was any objection to allowing the Crown an opportunity to conduct a picture identification procedure that afternoon or whether the appellant disputed that that should be allowed to happen at all, the appellant’s counsel replied that if the picture identification process proceeded and if the appellant were to be nominated, he (the appellant’s counsel) would “mount a discretionary submission that your honour should reject it because it’s three years after the event”. Counsel added that whilst he opposed the application he could see the Crown’s position. The trial judge correctly observed that he had no discretion to prevent a picture identification process from being carried out. It was only a matter of whether that was allowed in court time or whether it would be done out of court hours. 
      
       
        
       
     11    The complainant was called to give evidence on the following day. She said she was introduced to a person called “Raymond” by a mutual friend. She described him as aboriginal, of medium build and height, with hair about a centimetre long, and about 25 years of age. She said that, on that occasion, the person returned to her flat with others and stayed there for about four hours. She said that, about a week before the offences occurred and about three weeks after that meeting, the person visited her flat with others and stayed for, about four to five hours. On that occasion people addressed him as “Raymond”. About a week after that, this now being in October 1997, there was a small party at the complainant’s flat. The complainant said that Ms Goodridge and Ms Townsend were present and that the person, Raymond, came to the flat during the course of the evening. The complainant gave evidence of conversations with him on that occasion, the content of which is not presently material. At that stage, she said, there were only four people in the flat. These did not include either Ms Goodridge or Ms Townsend at that stage. Those who remained left the flat in circumstances which, again, it is unnecessary to recount here. It was then that, according to the complainant, the person, Raymond, committed the offences. The complainant gave evidence of complaint to Ms Goodridge, Ms Townsend and Ms Neal. She identified the appellant in court as the person, Raymond, her assailant. 
      
       
        
       
     12    Ms Goodridge gave evidence that she had met a person, introduced to her as “Raymond McDonald”, once before and again at the party. She gave evidence of the conversation with the complainant the following morning. She said that, two days before being called, she had selected a photograph from a series of photographs shown to her by the police. This was in response to being asked if she could identify “Raymond McDonald” among the photographs. Ms Goodridge was not asked in court what, if anything, she had said when she selected the photograph. However, when asked in court if she had marked the selected photograph, she volunteered that evidence. She said “Yes, I signed the back of it and said that I thought it was number 10. I was pretty sure it was number 10”. 
      
       
        
       
     13    Detective Hartcher gave evidence. He said that the photograph selected by Ms Goodridge was a photograph of the appellant, taken after he was arrested on 5 November 1998. There was no dispute about that. Detective Hartcher gave no evidence of what Ms Goodridge had said when she selected the appellant’s photograph. 
      
       
        
       
     14    Ms Townsend gave evidence that she had met a person called “Raymond” once before the night of the party and again at the party. Ms Townsend was then absent from the flat for a time. When she returned, she said, the same person was there. On the complainant’s evidence, the offences had occurred in the interim. Ms Townsend gave a description of the person referred to in her evidence. It was reasonably consistent with the appellant’s appearance, but that is all.  
      
       
        
       
     15    In cross examination, Detective Hartcher agreed that the appellant had a tattoo of a dog or a wolf on his chest and of a dragon, the words “mum” tattooed on his left shoulder, the word “dad” on his right shoulder and a cross on his right wrist. He also had a two centimetre scar at the bottom of his neck, a four centimetre scar on the left side of his neck and a five inch scar on the right side of his neck. At the request of the appellant’s counsel and with the judge’s permission, Detective Hartcher identified these tattoos and scars on the appellant’s body. 
      
       
        
       
     16    None of the tattoos or scars were mentioned to the police by the complainant. She admitted in her evidence that she had not seen them on the occasion of the offences or on the two previous occasions when she said she had met the appellant. She said the appellant had taken off his clothes at the time of the offences, but she said the room where the offences occurred was dark. 
      
       
        
       
     17    A brother of the appellant gave evidence in the appellant’s case. He said the scars and tattoos were all present in 1997. 
      
       
        
       
     18    It is convenient to deal with Ground 2 in the first instance. 
      
       
        
         
        Ground 2: His Honour erred by admitting evidence of a picture identification of the appellant by Rebecca Jane Goodridge. 
         
        
       
     19    Objection was taken to this evidence being admitted at the trial on the ground that the trial judge would be satisfied that its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused: Evidence Act 1995, s137. 
      
       
        
       
     20    His Honour rejected the submission. In a short judgment, he said: 
      
       
        
         
          
          Under s137, the Court is bound to refuse to admit evidence in the Crown case if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. Three matters are to be considered. Firstly, probative value. There is no doubt that the photograph of the accused forming as it would part of identification evidence has probative value. Then there is the question of unfair prejudice to the accused. It is not prejudice simpliciter, it is prejudice that has to be unfair. In relation to that phrase, Mr Segal has submitted that the lateness of the photograph and its examination by the potential witness gives greater room for error, and that photographic identification as with line-up identification, should take place as soon as is reasonably possible after the commission of the offence or the arrest of the accused. 
          
         
         
          
          Against this is the third matter.  
          The Crown Prosecutor has submitted that a correct identification of a photograph with the person of the accused after a period of time, demonstrates the strength of the memory rather than weakness of the memory. 
          
         
         
          
          These are two general statements. Neither of then are supported by authority, so one must apply commonsense in a reasoned fashion to the assessment of the two conflicting positions. In my discussions with Mr Segal, I think it would be apparent that  
          I hold the view that correct identification of the accused in circumstances where he has not otherwise been observed, some two and a half years after the event, would demonstrate strength of memory. In those circumstances, I am unable to appreciate that there would be any unfairness in the prejudice to the defendant. 
          
         
         
         
          
          I therefore hold that the probative value of the photographic identification of the accused by Miss Goodridge is not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused, and such evidence may be adduced by the Crown, subject to any other ruling. 
          
         
         
          
          [Emphasis added] 
          
         
        
       
     21    There was a logical flaw in using the identification evidence itself as evidence of a good memory, and hence as evidence of the reliability of the witness’ identification evidence. The matter in question - the reliability of the identification evidence - was assumed as a basis for finding that the identification evidence was likely to be reliable.  
      
       
        
       
     22    The reasoning was even the more flawed because the implicit starting assumption (the fact of identity) was of a higher order than the conclusion (that the evidence of identity was likely to be reliable). 
      
       
        
       
     23    This process of reasoning was then seen by his Honour as precluding any finding of unfair prejudice. The approach was this: If the evidence was likely to be reliable, how could its admission be unfair? The approach - founded as it was on an illogical line of reasoning - thus led his Honour to disqualify himself from taking into account the well known reasons why photo identification evidence may be unreliable.  
      
       
        
       
     24    His Honour also appears to have overlooked the terms in which the identification evidence was given in this case. True, it was the accused’s photograph that the witness selected, but she said only that it looked like the person she had met and that she was pretty sure. That did not make the evidence inadmissible but it was of much less probative value than a confident, unqualified identification. 
      
       
        
       
     25    By finding the evidence had high probative value, through an error of reasoning and an overstatement of the evidence, and by not taking into account considerations which militated against the probative value of evidence of this kind, his Honour was precluded from evaluating whether there was a risk of unfair prejudice to the appellant on the basis that the jury might give the evidence more weight than it warranted. 
      
       
        
       
     26    His Honour was not bound to be unconvinced that the danger of unfair prejudice outweighed the probative value of the evidence. Accordingly, the failure to undertake the exercise required by s137 in a logical way and having regard to relevant considerations may have resulted in evidence being admitted which would otherwise have been excluded. 
      
       
        
       
     27    It is sufficient if the appellant lost a chance of acquittal. The evidence was important. It went some way to corroborate the complainant’s evidence of identity, and identity was the only real issue in this case. The reliability of the complainant’s identification evidence was disputed. Ms Goodridge’s identification evidence might, therefore, have affected the outcome. But for error, her evidence might have been excluded. That is a miscarriage of justice. 
      
       
        
       
     28    This ground of appeal should accordingly be upheld. 
      
       
        
         
        Other grounds of appeal 
         
        
       
     29    I have serious misgiving about other grounds of appeal, in particular in relation to Grounds 3 and 4. As to Ground 3 (in-court identification evidence by the complainant), there was no warning by the trial judge - as distinct from reference to the arguments of counsel - concerning the well known hazard of identifying an accused person in the dock as the offender. Those hazards were compounded, in this instance, by a photo identification made by the complainant the day before, and the consequent risk of “displacement effect”. However, the jury knew nothing of the photo identification and the trial judge may have known only that photo identification by the complainant was to be attempted. That is a complication. 
      
       
        
       
     30    As to Ground 4 (photo identification evidence by Ms Goodridge), there was no warning by the trial judge concerning the well known hazards of photo identification as such. 
      
       
        
       
     31    However, because it is clear that the appeal should be allowed on Ground 2, it would be unfair to the appellant to take time to give further consideration to other grounds of appeal. 
      
       
        
         
        Conclusion and Orders 
        
       
     32    The appeal should be allowed on Ground 2. No opinion is expressed, one way or the other, in relation to other grounds of appeal. 
      
       
        
       
     33    I propose the following orders: 
      
       
        
         
          
          (1) Appeal allowed. 
          
         
         
          
          (2) Conviction quashed.

      The Respondent pleaded guilty to seven charges of defrauding a public company in contravention of s176A of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900. The effective sentence imposed by Shadbolt DCJ was a term of imprisonment of five years, with a non-parole period of two years.

      per Simpson J; Spigelman CJ agreeing 
       
       
      1 Special circumstances were relevant to the determination of the non-parole period in this case. However, his Honour gave excessive weight to them. 
       
       
      2 Accordingly, his Honour erred in imposing a non-parole period of two years. 
       
       
      per Einfeld AJ 
       
      3 Though the finding of special circumstances was borderline, it was open to his Honour on the evidence to settle on the non-parole period he chose.

      REGINA v Adam Mathew JACKSON 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
     1 SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with Simpson J. 
     2 SIMPSON J: I have read in draft the judgment of Einfeld AJ.  
     3 I regret that I am unable to agree that the Crown appeal should be dismissed. The respondent admitted no less than twenty-nine offences, involving more than five million dollars, systematically committed over a two year period. On the first count on the indictment, which, like all others, carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for ten years, the sentencing judge took into account twenty-two offences listed pursuant to s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. It was, accordingly, on this count that he imposed the lengthiest sentence of imprisonment for five years. Having found special circumstances under s 44 of the same Act, he specified a non parole period of two years. On counts 2,3,4 and 6 he imposed concurrent sentences of four years with a non parole period of eighteen months. On counts 9 and 12 he sentenced the respondent to imprisonment for three years with a non parole period of fifteen months, also to be served concurrently. 
     4 There were, it is true, subjective circumstances engendering sympathy, but, in my view, these should not be allowed to obscure the objective criminality involved. The respondent in fact received a significant benefit as the result of subjective circumstances; in my opinion, although they did not become irrelevant on the question of special circumstances, care had to be taken that they were not given undue significance, resulting in a disproportionately low non parole period. In fact, in my opinion, that is what happened. In my opinion, given a lenient head sentence as the starting point, the reduction of the non parole period by way of special circumstances to a mere two years is unsustainable. 
     5 What the sentencing judge did was to assess the appropriate head sentence, taking into account all subjective matters other than the plea of guilty, as seven years, and reduce this to five years by reason of the plea of guilty. This represents a discount at above the top of the range promulgated as appropriate recognition for the utilitarian value alone of a plea of guilty in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383. That was not inappropriate. The respondent admitted his guilt on the day he was interviewed by auditors, and instructed his solicitors to enter pleas of guilty on his behalf to the offences. A trial, while a verdict would have been a foregone conclusion, would nevertheless have been complex and would have involved proof of the financial trail of twenty-nine cheques, and the purchases of real estate and other property by the respondent. Further, although it is not relevant to the discount for the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty, the plea on this occasion, as well as other evidence, demonstrated genuine contrition.  
     6 It may thus be accepted, and particularly so in the absence of any challenge by the Crown, that the head sentence of five years was appropriate. The questions which remain are whether the evidence justified the finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44 (2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  1999; and, if so, whether the variation made was within justifiable limits. 
     7 The Crown contended that the finding of special circumstances was not open. I have given careful consideration to whether the evidence did warrant a finding of special circumstances. As Einfeld AJ has observed, the case for special circumstances was “borderline”. In explaining the finding of special circumstances, the judge referred, globally, to all of the subjective matters that he had recounted. He appears to have considered all of them as relevant to the question of special circumstances. I am not persuaded that all - for example, the recovery of the bulk of the defalcations - can properly be taken into account on an assessment of special circumstances. It is not necessary, here, to dissect the conclusion that special circumstances exist and I have not been able to conclude that the finding was not one which was open to the sentencing judge. Accordingly, I would not disturb it.  
     8 However, I am quite satisfied that the allowance that was made was excessive to a point that is unsustainable. 
     9 Without a finding of special circumstances, the non-parole period would have been three years and nine months. I cannot see any sufficient basis in the evidence for reducing the non-parole period to a little more than half that. I accept, as the sentencing judge found, that the respondent will, on release, have difficulty in returning to employment, that he is young, that this is his first time in prison, and indeed, his first foray into criminality. I accept that he will have difficulty adjusting to the very different lifestyle he will lead after his release. What I am unable to accept is that a variation of the non-parole period of the magnitude in fact allowed does not represent discretionary error. I am satisfied that such discretionary error has been established. The non parole period imposed in relation to the first count was manifestly inadequate.  
     10 In my opinion the principles applying to the imposition of sentence following a successful Crown appeal - that is, that this court will impose a sentence at the lower end of the appropriate range - apply equally to variation of a non-parole period as in the present circumstances. In my opinion the lowest non-parole period that could reasonably have been imposed, bearing in mind the finding of special circumstances, is one of three years. 
     11 I have considered evidence tendered as relevant to the residual discretion this court retains even after such a conclusion. This relates principally to hardship that will be suffered by the respondent’s wife and child and, indeed, the respondent, by reason of his incarceration. It is not in my opinion, sufficient to warrant the exercise of that discretion.  
     12 I propose the following orders: 
      
       
      1. as to the sentence imposed in relation to the first count on the indictment, and taking into account the twenty-two matters on the Form 1: 
       
       
       (i) the Crown appeal be allowed; 
       
       
       (ii) the sentence imposed be quashed; 
       
       
        
        (iii) in lieu thereof the respondent be sentenced to imprisonment for five years to commence on 18 March 2001 and expire on 17 March 2006, with a non parole period of three years to commence on 18 March 2001 and expire on 17 March 2004. 
        
       
       
      2. The Crown appeal against the remaining sentences be dismissed. 
       
     13 EINFELD AJ: The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) has appealed a sentence pronounced on Adam Mathew Jackson, (the respondent) by the District Court (Judge Shadbolt) on 23 March 2001 on seven charges of defrauding a public company in contravention of section 176A of the Crimes Act to which the respondent had pleaded guilty before a magistrate. He had admitted the offences to investigators virtually from the outset. His Honour was asked to take into account 22 further offences under the same section admitted by the respondent, each involving the making and negotiation of company cheques for personal purposes. The effective sentence was imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 2 years. 
     14 The respondent is now almost 32 years old. He married in March 1999 and the couple has one son, with another child to be born soon. The offences were committed over a two year period from May 1997 to May 1999 meaning that he was 27 years old when his criminal activity commenced. He was then the Company Secretary of Manpower Services Australia Pty Ltd (“the employer”), an American personnel recruitment company operating internationally. He was authorised to operate the company’s bank accounts at the Westpac, Commonwealth and National Australia Banks in which role he wrote the 29 cheques involved in the offences before the Court. The amount involved was more than $5.2 million, used to pay personal financial commitments and make significant purchases including three separate real estate properties, one with deep water frontage and private jetty; a large motor cruiser, four motor vehicles; and a number of Sydney Olympic Games tickets. 
     15 The offences dealt with by Judge Shadbolt carried maximum sentences of 10 years imprisonment. They involved a large sum of money, were consistently, skilfully and frequently pursued over a two year period, and were effected by changing and falsifying entries on accounts which the respondent operated without external scrutiny. They represented gross breaches of trust, especially the trust of his CEO to whom he had lied about his qualifications for this position before he was appointed. He had, in fact, been lying about his personal achievements and successes to all and sundry for many years including to the woman who was to become his wife. The defalcations were carried out to provide the respondent with a lavish lifestyle, which he otherwise could not have afforded, and to give the quite false impression to friends and associates that he was a highly successful young business executive who was “going places”. By themselves these facts demonstrated a wanton disregard for honest and trustworthy dealings and for the interests of his employer, and called for a lengthy custodial sentence as both punishment and deterrence to others in similar positions of trust, and to reflect the seriousness of the crimes committed. 
     16 There were a number of countervailing factors which his Honour was asked to take into account. First was the respondent’s good character, at least in the sense that he had no previous criminal convictions. On the one hand, this element is commendable because he was born to a woman of 15 years of age, and effectively had no father. On the other hand, good character may be diminished somewhat by the length of time over which the offences were committed, the amount of money involved, and the purpose of the frauds. Second was the plea of guilty demonstrating remorse and contrition and saving court time, official expense and stress on witnesses. The respondent knew at all relevant times that his conduct would eventually be discovered. 
     17 The respondent has made substantial reparation. The employer recovered all or most of the stolen money on insurance and the respondent has repaid the insurance company all but about $300,000 of this money by selling the fraudulently acquired real estate and other goods, and by selling his own home which he had purchased legitimately. He also worked during his remand period to make further reparation and provide for his wife and child who, by that time, and pending his sentence to an inevitable gaol term, were living with her father in Queensland. They are still there, and he is serving his time at Grafton. He has in substance “lost everything” except his wife and child(ren), and despite an offer by one of his character witnesses to employ him on his release, he will struggle to find remunerative employment in the future. He will need extensive supervision and support after release. The respondent’s wife has undertaken a risky second pregnancy because delay is believed likely to worsen a gynaecological problem. If all goes well, she will have two children under two and a half under her care for about 1 and a half years. 
     18 Judge Shadbolt assessed the appropriate head sentence as 7 years but reduced it to 5 years because of all these factors. He regarded the subjective material as sufficient “special circumstances” to reduce the statutory ratio for the non-parole period to 2 years. The DPP did not seriously challenge the head sentence, but argued that the non-parole period which, he said, “most reflects the punitive aspect of the sentence, … does not adequately reflect the criminality of the respondent’s conduct…[and] does not fit the objective seriousness of the respondent’s offences.” He submitted that the finding of “special circumstances” was erroneous. The respondent agreed that the sentence was lenient but not so manifestly inadequate as to indicate error of principle or mistake of law or fact. He contended that the “special circumstances” finding was open on the evidence and was appropriate, especially as it was made by a very experienced sentencing Judge. 
     19 As I read them, the case law and the sentencing statistics do not provide any definitive guidance to the resolution of this case. There is a need to avoid possible “double jeopardy” applicable to Crown appeals, as well as a double discount on both levels of the sentence. The sentence must reflect the very large amount defrauded, and the length of time over which it was taken, while allowing for the substantial reparation and the huge impact on the respondent and his family of the subjective circumstances. 
     20 The head sentence imposed undoubtedly was lenient but the DPP did not ask for its variation. I think the finding of “special circumstances” to be borderline but I have, with some hesitation, concluded that it was open to his Honour on the evidence. This finding permitted him to settle on the non-parole period he chose and, although low, I cannot find it to be so out of kilter with precedent or the facts as to command this Court to intervene. 
     21 I would dismiss the appeal.

     REGINA v Anthony James DALEY 
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
      HER HONOUR : 
      
    1    The accused was arraigned on an indictment containing 21 charges. Four counts are of detaining for advantage; five of aggravated sexual assault; three of attempted sexual assault; eight of armed robbery; and one of indecent assault. He indicated that he intended to plead not guilty to each charge. The Crown served on the accused’s legal representatives a brief of the evidence it proposed to adduce, together with a notice of intention to adduce both tendency and coincidence evidence (Evidence Act 1995, ss 97,98). The trial was fixed for hearing, with an estimate of six weeks, to commence on 7 May 2001. The charges involve allegations made by eight different complainants, all of them female. 
     
      
    2    By notice of motion filed on 30 April 2001, the accused sought a number of orders concerning the future progress of the trial. The first order he sought was for a separate trial of the charges relevant to each individual complainant - that is, that there be eight separate trials. As an alternative in the event of failure in relation to this application, he sought separate trials of groups of the charges, arranged by reference to common features, such as the dates or the locations of the alleged offences, or other common evidentiary features. 
     
      
    3    Further, he sought pre-trial rulings on whether certain identified aspects of the evidence would be admitted, either on a joint trial or on separate trials. This included, but was far from limited to, the proposed tendency and coincidence evidence. Indeed, it appeared to me that the challenged evidence covers a very large proportion of the Crown case. It was apparent that the rulings on the admission of evidence, especially the tendency and coincidence evidence, would have a significant bearing on the outcome of the separate trials application. If the challenge to the evidence were unsuccessful, there would be less basis for ordering separate trials. If, on the other hand, the tendency and/or coincidence evidence were excluded in relation to the allegations made by one or more of the complainants, then the case for separating the trials would have been stronger. Indeed, I was of the view that a separation of the charges relating to the individual applicants would inevitably follow a decision to exclude the tendency and/or coincidence evidence. The reason for that will become apparent when the Crown allegations are briefly stated. 
     
      
    4    In view of this conclusion, it is appropriate to consider the evidentiary matters first.  
     
      
    5    A voir dire commenced on 8 May and proceeded over almost two weeks. Virtually the whole of the Crown case was put before me, and I heard extensive argument on the admissibility of various components of the evidence in the Crown case. On 22 May I announced rulings on all evidentiary matters, reserving reasons, which were not then in final or deliverable form. These are those reasons. For completeness I should add that, on 24 May, when indicted, the accused pleaded guilty to six charges. These were two counts each of sexual intercourse without consent, armed robbery and detaining for advantage. Two victims were the subject of these counts. The accused indicated, pursuant to s 32(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, that he wanted the court to take into account an additional thirteen offences, being offences of which the accused admitted his guilt. These thirteen offences included all except two of the offences with which he had previously been charged. The matter was then stood over to 23 July to allow any evidence relevant to sentence, and submissions, to be put before the court. On that day the accused appeared unrepresented, having terminated his instructions to his legal representatives. He informed me that he wished to seek leave to withdraw his pleas of guilty, and his admission of guilt of the s 32 offences, and he wished to seek alternative legal representation. On 31 July he again appeared, this time with counsel, who confirmed the intention to seek leave to reverse the plea of guilty. That application has been fixed for hearing on 6 December 2001. 
     
      
    6    The reasons for my evidentiary rulings that follow were largely prepared before the accused sought to change his pleas. I have made no changes in substance following that indication; any editing has been as to form, or style. 
     
      
    7    I was provided with and read copies of statements of the witnesses the Crown intended to call. Whether this was the totality, or only part, of the Crown material, I do not know. It has enabled me to obtain an appreciation of, at least, the skeleton of the Crown case.  
     
      
    8    The Crown alleges that, on separate occasions over a period beginning on 5 September 1998 and ending on 7 July 2000, eight women were attacked. Five were sexually assaulted, one was indecently assaulted, and attempts were made sexually to assault three. (The indecent assault is alleged to have been committed on one of the victims who was also the subject of the attempted sexual assault; another victim was the subject of both a completed sexual assault and an attempted sexual assault. One woman was robbed but not sexually assaulted and no threat of, or attempt at, sexual assault was made.) Each complainant was allegedly robbed, and threatened with either a knife or a screwdriver. Four complainants were detained against their will, for the purpose either of sexual gratification or robbery or both. 
     
      
    9    It is the Crown case that a number of common threads permeate the description of the assaults upon the individual complainants. For example, it is alleged that in each case of sexual assault or attempted sexual assault, the assailant’s chosen form of intercourse was fellatio, although one complainant was also vaginally raped and another threatened with the same. There are a number of other asserted similarities in the behaviour alleged, to which I will return. From these similarities, the Crown contends that an inference may be drawn that the offences were all committed by the same man. From other evidence the Crown seeks to prove that that man was the accused. 
     
      
    10    It is convenient now to set out, in summary form, the nub of the allegations made by each complainant. They are set out below in chronological order. 
     
      
       
      Complainant 1 (CLI) 
       
      
    11    At about 8.55 pm on 5 September 1998 Complainant 1, then aged twenty-six years, drove to the Parramatta Golf Club to meet friends. She parked her car in the parking area, near some bushes. She was accosted by a man who was holding a knife in his right hand. He told her not to scream, told her that he had the knife, and demanded money. With his right arm around her he forced her to walk towards the bushes and onto the golf course. He asked her name and age and if she had any family. He told her to stay calm, not to scream, threatened that if she screamed he would cut her throat, and said that he had done this before and would not hesitate. He ordered Complainant 1 to get down on her knees, which she did; he walked in front of her, belatedly disguising his face with a black balaclava. He unzipped his pants, and exposed his penis which was erect; he asked Complainant 1 if she had ever given oral sex before. She said she had not and he asked if she had a boyfriend. He told her to put his penis in her mouth and then said “Put my dick in and out of your mouth”.  
     
      
       
      Complainant 1 became very upset. He told her to get on her back and take her pants off and threatened that if she did not obey he would hurt her. He told her not to panic. He then raped her vaginally. He kissed her first on the cheek, then on the mouth, forcing his tongue into her mouth. She resisted, he told her that if she did not kiss him properly he would cut her, and held the knife up behind her head. With his penis inside Complainant 1’s vagina, he ejaculated. He did up his own trousers and told Complainant 1 to get dressed.  
       
      
    12    He told her to empty her wallet and asked if she had a key card, how much money was in her account, demanded to be told her PIN, and asked if she had anything gold. He took a signet ring she was wearing.  
     
      
    13    He told her to lie on the ground, face down, and not to move or make a sound, threatening that if she did he would come back and hurt her. He ran off some distance. After about 20 seconds, Complainant 1 began to get up and he told her to stay where she was.  
     
      
       
      Complainant 2: (CMM) 
       
      
    14    At about 9.15 pm on Thursday 29 October, 1998, Complainant 2 parked her car in Rofe Street, Leichhardt, near her home. As she unloaded her vehicle she was approached by a man who asked her the time. When she answered she saw that he was holding a knife. He told her not to scream and that he wanted her bag. He took her backpack and left, saying “I’m desperate”. Complainant 2 was thirty-seven years of age at the time. 
     
      
       
      Complainant 3: (COM) 
       
      
    15    Complainant 3 was attacked at about 12.35 am on Saturday 31 October 1998 in Leichhardt. She was walking from a bus stop in Parramatta Road and was in Thornley Street. A man approached from in front of her, holding a screwdriver in his left hand at head height. He told her not to scream and that he needed money. He repeated “I’m desperate. I’m desperate.” He took Complainant 3’s handbag but then handed it back to her; with his hand on top of her head he pushed her to her knees, pulled his shorts down, exposing his penis, and told Complainant 3 to suck on his penis. He put his penis in her mouth. He then asked Complainant 3 if she had a boyfriend and when she said she did not he said that that was a shame because she was very good at what he was forcing her to do. She protested that she was going to be sick and mentioned neighbours who would be awake. He ordered her to finish what he had made her begin. She began to cry and he told her not to scream and mentioned the screwdriver. She gave him the bag and ran home. Complainant 3 was twenty-two years of age. 
     
      
       
      Complainant 4: (SAM) 
       
      
    16    Complainant 4, a forty year old woman, was also attacked in Leichhardt. At about 10.45 pm on Thursday 5 November 1998 she was walking from a bus stop in Norton Street. She was approached by a man who asked her the time, and then told her not to scream. He indicated a knife in his right hand and said that if she screamed he would jam the knife in her throat. He ordered Complainant 4 to give him her bag and asked how much money was in it, adding that he was desperate. He touched her on one of her shoulders and told her to get down on her knees. She asked why and he replied “I want a head job”. He insisted, but Complainant 4 firmly refused and began to walk up the steps of her house. He again demanded “a head job”, saying, again, “I’m desperate”. Complainant 4 again refused and opened her front door revealing her dog in the doorway. The man told her that he would leave the wallet the following day, and ran off. 
     
      
       
      Complainant 5 (EK) 
       
      
    17    At 10.50 pm on Thursday 20 April 2000 Complainant 5, aged thirty-four, drove into the garage of her home in Parramatta. A man was standing near the front of her car and asked her the time. She told him the time, and told him to go away. He walked towards her and she told him not to come any closer. He told her to listen, to shut up, or he would stab her. He was holding an object which she described as “long and silver” in his right hand. He told her to do as he told her or he would stab her to death, would kill her. He demanded her bag. She said there was $500 in it, and to take it. He told her to shut up and give it to him. He then told her to get down on her knees. He said “I want you to suck my cock”. She refused. He reminded her of his threat to stab her, unzipped his jeans and exposed his penis and told her “Just do it”. He put his penis in her mouth. He asked where her husband was and if she did this with her husband. He asked if she had done it before, if he were the first she had done it to, and if she liked it. She realised that the weapon she had previously thought was a knife was in fact a screw driver and pushed him away. He began running away and she chased him. He jumped over a fence, turned and said “Thanks for the head job”.  
     
      
       
      Complainant 6: (LR) 
       
      
    18    At 11.30 pm on 12 May 2000 Complainant 6 drove into the garage of her home unit block in Westmead. As she left the car a man approached her and asked her how much money she had. He was holding a knife in his right hand. He told her to do as he said or he would cut her throat. She agreed to do whatever he wanted and asked him not to hurt her and he led her from the garage, telling her to go with him. He again told her to do what he ordered, saying that unless she did would hurt her. He said: “I want a head job”. He led her to the side of a neighbouring house, pushed her against the fence and told her to get down. He lowered his shorts and exposed his penis and told her to put it in her mouth and start sucking. He was holding the knife in his right hand. He ordered her to put his penis in her mouth, and when she did, told her to put it further in. At the same time he pushed his penis further inside her mouth. Complainant 6 gagged and dry retched and the man told her to put it in or he would hurt her. He held the knife closer to her.  
     
      
    19    She apologised, saying she had never done this before, and this appeared to please him. He asked if he were her first, if she had a husband and if she lived alone. He told her she was beautiful, and said: “Deeper, deeper, come on or I’ll hurt you”. He was wearing a glove on his right hand.  
     
      
    20    The man then ordered Complainant 6 to lie on the ground “so I can stick in you”. She refused. He hesitated, put his penis back in her mouth, and said “I just want to come. Keep sucking. I want to come in your mouth. Come on or I’ll hurt you”. He began to ejaculate, and ordered Complainant 6 to swallow the semen or he would hurt her. She gagged and dry retched. The man withdrew his penis and masturbated to complete the ejaculation. 
     
      
    21    He then asked Complainant 6 how much money she had and she handed him her brief case. He told her to leave and began to walk away, turning and telling her not to turn around, not to follow him. Complainant 6 was thirty-five years of age. 
     
      
       
      Complainant 7: (JM) 
       
      
    22    At about 6.30 pm on Friday 23 June 2000 Complainant 7 left her employment at Westmead and began to drive off in her car. A man opened her car door. He was holding a knife in his left hand and told Complainant 7 to get into the back of the car and said that what he was doing was not a joke. She did as she was told. He then drove the car off, telling her to keep down and shut up. He told her to stop crying, and said if she was a good girl everything would be OK. He asked if she had any money, and asked her name. He said: “OK, Jen, if you’re a good girl everything’s going to be OK”. He continued to say this, but told her not to do anything stupid because he would not hesitate in hurting her. 
     
      
    23    He drove for a little while, and returned to Complainant 7’s place of employment. He told her to get out of the car, not to do anything stupid because he would not hesitate in hurting her, and referred to the knife. Complainant 7 alighted from the car, the man behind her, holding her left shoulder with his left hand, and holding the knife into her back with his right hand. He told her to get on her knees, and pushed her down. He told her that she knew what he wanted and exposed his penis which he put in her mouth. He said: “Give it to me good. Slow down. Give me a love bite on my knob”. He told her to lie down and when she did so she lifted her skirt and removed her underwear. He began to insert his penis into her vagina but she told him that she was wearing a tampon. He then said: “Have you ever been fucked up the arse?” She said she had not and asked him not to do that and he pulled her onto her knees, told her to “Finish it”, and re-inserted his penis in her mouth. He then asked if she had a boyfriend, if Complainant 7 did this to him and if the boyfriend ejaculated in her mouth. When she said he did not, he said “So I am going to be the first”. 
     
      
    24    The man began masturbating and told Complainant 7 to finish what she was doing, that he was going to ejaculate and that if she spilled any of the semen he would hurt her. He ejaculated in her mouth. She began to gag and he ordered her to swallow the semen.  
     
      
    25    The man then picked up Complainant 7 and guided her to a corner of the building, told her to lie face down between the building and the fence, and asked if she had any money in the bag. He told her to get up and not do anything stupid or he would hurt her. He said he would not hesitate in hurting her and told her that she was not the first girl that he had done this to.  
     
      
    26    The man was wearing black gloves. They returned to the car and he demanded all of her money, saying that he would leave her licence with her. He told Complainant 7 to lie down on the back seat of the car. He asked Complainant 7 what her boyfriend’s name was. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “If you want to blame anyone blame him. This is what he gets for messing with me or my boys. I’m going to kill your fucking boyfriend, he’s a fucking cunt. I’ve been paid to kill you, I’ve been watching you for weeks.” 
        
       
      
    27    The man wiped down the areas of the car that he had touched, told Complainant 7 to stay where she was and to give him a couple of seconds to get away, and ran off.  
     
      
      Complainant 7 was twenty-five years of age. 
       
       
      Complainant 8: (LPS) 
       
      
    28    At about 6.25 pm on Friday 7 July 2000, Complainant 8, who was twenty-one years of age, walked from the Westmead Railway Station to nearby Moree Avenue where her car was parked. She found that the back passenger’s quarter window was smashed and began to examine the damage. She was approached by a man who asked if she owned the car, and said that he had seen two men run away, about five or ten minutes earlier. He then grabbed Complainant 8 by the right shoulder, told her to listen, to do what he said and that he had a knife. He was holding a knife in his right hand, the blade about 5 cm from her neck. 
     
      
    29    He forced her away from the car, told her to do as he told her, and that he was not scared to kill her. He directed her to the garden in front of the house, still holding the knife in his right hand, and Complainant 8’s right shoulder with his left hand. He told her to get down on her knees. She asked why, and he said: “I want you to suck me”. She refused. He said: “Do you think I’m scared, I’m not scared to kill you”. She refused again. He then said: “Do you want me to fuck you?” She said she did not, and he then said: “Well come on and do it, just a blow job. I’m not scared to kill you.” 
     
      
    30    The man asked if she had any money and how much. He demanded that she kiss him. He said he would leave her alone if she kissed him properly. He kissed Complainant 8 on the mouth, still holding the knife, and moving it towards her. She screamed for help and the man moved away and jumped over the fence, walking towards Complainant 8’s car. He walked from the car taking with him her handbag.  
     
      
       
       • • • 
       
      
    31    It is the Crown case that the evidence gives rise to a powerful inference that the same man was responsible for all of the attacks, and that man was the accused. It seeks to adduce evidence of the following kinds:- 
     
      
       
      (i) DNA evidence linking the accused with the assaults on Complainants 1 and 6; 
       
       
      (ii) evidence that Complainants 4, 5 and 7 identified the accused from an array of photographs shown to them by police; 
       
       
      (iii) evidence that, from a series of tape recordings played to them by police, each of Complainants 1, 3, 4, 6 and 7 identified the accused’s voice as the voice of her attacker,  
       
       
      (iv) evidence that each complainant participated in an examination of clothing belonging to the accused and identified certain items as the clothing, or similar to the clothing, worn by her attacker; 
       
       
      (v) evidence that each complainant was shown an array of knives and screw drivers and identified an implement as similar to the weapon used by her attacker. 
       
       
      1. Tendency & Coincidence Evidence 
      
    32    The evidence identified by the Crown as both tendency and coincidence evidence was encapsulated in a schedule attached to the notice of intention to rely on evidence of that kind. For convenience, a copy of the schedule, with the complainants rendered anonymous, is attached to this judgment. Put shortly, the Crown seeks to rely, as both tendency and coincidence evidence, on features of the accounts of the attacks upon them given by the complainants. The schedule reveals, as does the short summary of each of the attacks upon the complainants above, a number of recurring features. This is not to say that all complainants gave identical accounts of the attacks upon them; there were, of course, some differences. However, the Crown asserts, and seeks by the evidence to prove, that a pattern can be discerned, and that the common features were such as to justify a conclusion that the same man was responsible for all offences. The similarities, or common features, on which the Crown seeks to rely include the locations in which the offences were committed (five in a small area of the Parramatta - Westmead District, three in Leichhardt); the time of day (after dark); the approach made to the victim by the offender; where the victim was sexually assaulted, or where an attempt at sexual assault, or a demand for sexual gratification was made, the chosen mode of sexual assault (forced fellatio); that the offender was armed with a knife or similar weapon; that the victim was robbed as well as assaulted; the language used by the offender; and the offender’s manner of departure from the scene. 
     
      
    33    The accused resists the admission of the evidence, either as tendency or as coincidence evidence. As a preliminary point, he challenges its characterisation as tendency evidence. He makes no such challenge to the characterisation of the evidence as coincidence evidence. 
     
      
    34    “Tendency evidence” is defined in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act as evidence of a kind referred to in s97(1) that a party seeks to have adduced for the purpose referred to in that subsection.  
     
      
    35    S 97 is relevantly in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person’s character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind, if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the party adducing the evidence has not given reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the court thinks that the evidence would not, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence have significant probative value.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      
    36    “Tendency evidence” is, therefore, evidence adduced for the purpose of proving that a person had a tendency to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind. No doubt the most common application of tendency evidence, where admitted, is to lay the foundation for an inference that the person in question, by reason of his or her tendency to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind, did, on a relevant occasion, act in that way, or acted with that state of mind or with a particular motivation. Such evidence is apt to fix the person whose tendency has been proved with responsibility for an act which otherwise might not be able to be attributed to him or her; or to negative a suggestion that an event occurred accidentally. 
     
      
    37    The end point of the admission of evidence as tendency evidence, it seems to me, is most likely to be the conclusion that the person concerned was the person who did an act in question; or that a person, whose tendency has been proved, did an act in question with a relevant state of mind.  
     
      
    38    It is to be observed, in passing, that s 97 is directed to the admissibility of tendency evidence in both civil and criminal proceedings. There are particular restrictions, to which it will be necessary to refer in due course, on the admission of tendency evidence (and coincidence evidence) in criminal proceedings. 
     
      
    39    In differentiating between tendency evidence and coincidence evidence counsel for the accused made a valid point. While the two concepts have elements in common, have a common origin, and are often referred to as though interchangeable, and while the criteria for admission are in both cases identical, the drafters of the Evidence Act quite clearly and deliberately drew a distinction between the two kinds of evidence. 
     
      
    40    That the tests of admissibility are identical, and that there is no challenge to the characterisation of the evidence as coincidence evidence, does not obviate the need to determine the issue raised as to the characterisation of the evidence as tendency evidence. That is because, should the evidence be admitted, appropriate directions to the jury will be necessary.  
     
      
    41    For completeness, I note that the Evidence Act Dictionary definition of coincidence evidence is in terms that parallel the definition of tendency evidence. “Coincidence evidence” is defined as evidence of a kind referred to in s 98(1) that a party seeks to have adduced for the purpose referred to that subsection. 
     
      
    42    The coincidence rule is contained in s 98, relevantly in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Evidence that 2 or more related events occurred is not admissible to prove that, because of the improbability of the events occurring coincidentally, a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the party adducing the evidence has not given reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the court thinks that the evidence would not, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) For the purposes of sub section (1), 2 or more events are taken to be related events if and only if: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) they are substantially and relevantly similar, and 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the circumstances in which they occurred are substantially similar.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    43    Broadly speaking, ss 97 and 98 are, effectively, statutory formulations (or reformulations) of the common law concepts of, respectively, “propensity” and “similar fact” evidence. There has not always been as clear a distinction drawn between evidence of the two kinds as is now drawn in the Evidence Act, and too categorically to relate tendency evidence to propensity evidence and coincidence evidence to similar fact evidence would be potentially erroneous. The analogy is of the broadest kind. The admissibility of tendency and coincidence evidence is now governed primarily by the provisions of the Evidence Act. To the extent (if any) that the principles developed by the common law are inconsistent with provisions of the Evidence Act, the latter must prevail: R v OGD[No.2] [2000] NSW CCA 404; 50 NSWLR 433. 
     
      
       
      Is the evidence “tendency evidence? 
       
      
    44    Before turning to the criteria for admissibility of evidence of either kind, it is convenient to dispose of the challenge to the characterisation of the evidence as tendency evidence. The evidence outlined in the schedule can be dealt with as a whole, since there was no contention that certain parts of it raised issues different from any other parts of it. The approach taken by counsel was based on the assumption that, if any part of the evidence in question was tendency evidence, then it all came within that category; and, similarly, if any part of it was not within that category, then none of it was. 
     
      
    45    Notwithstanding the validity of the distinction to which counsel drew attention, the challenge to the characterisation of the evidence as tendency evidence fails. It is, in my opinion, based upon a misconception about what the drafters of s 97 intended to be encompassed by that section.  
     
      
    46    The argument advanced on behalf of the accused was, in essence, that because the accused has neither admitted, nor been convicted of, any of the conduct evidence of which is tendered as tendency evidence, that conduct (or alleged conduct) cannot be used to prove that he had a tendency to act in that way, or to have a particular state of mind. In other words, so the argument went, the tender of the evidence on that basis assumed the truth of the allegations made against the accused.  
     
      
    47    The argument had some initial appeal, but it does not withstand analysis. It may be that the proposition contained in the argument was founded upon a single sentence in the judgment of Deane J in Sutton v R (1984) 152 CLR 528, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the other hand, if the similarities between the offences which the accused undoubtedly committed and the offence with which he is charged are such as to warrant, in the context of all the evidence, the conclusion that, in the absence of extraordinary coincidence, the same person committed all the offences or if the similarity between the evidence of different witnesses as to different offences which the accused is said by them to have committed is so striking “that they must, when judged by experience and common sense, either all be true, or have arisen from a cause common to the witnesses or from pure coincidence…” 
         
        
       
      Emphasis is to be placed on the word “undoubtedly” appearing in the second line. 
       
      
    48    In Pfennig v R (1995) 182 CLR 461, the tendency of the accused that the Crown sought to prove was a tendency sexually to molest young boys. The High Court held that the evidence was admissible for that purpose. However, there, as counsel correctly pointed out, the conduct in question was the subject of an admission by the accused. 
     
      
    49    Pfennig was, therefore, an instance of a case in which a high degree of certainty attended the proof of the conduct relied upon to establish tendency; the passage extracted from Sutton above, supports the argument that a high level of cogency is required before evidence of tendency may properly be admitted (or at least, was required in the evidentiary regime that pre-dated the enactment of the Evidence Act). But questions of admissibility are not to be confused with the question of the proper characterisation of the evidence and that is the present issue. 
     
      
    50    By reason of the definition contained in the Dictionary, and s 97, tendency evidence is “evidence of the character, reputation, or conduct of a person …”. For present purposes, character and reputation may be put to one side; neither raises its head in the current issue. There is nothing in s 97 that requires that, before evidence of conduct tendered as tendency may properly be so described, the conduct must be admitted or proved to any particular level of probability or certainty. 
     
      
    51    Applying the plain words of the section to the challenged evidence, it would be open to the Crown (questions of admissibility aside) to seek to prove the accused’s tendency to act in a particular way by seeking to prove that he had acted in that, or in a relevant, way, on another occasion or other occasions. Thus, in seeking to prove the accused was guilty of the offences committed against Complainant 1, it would be open to the Crown (again, I emphasise, other questions of admissibility aside) to seek to prove that he had committed relevantly similar offences against Complainants 2 - 8. Such an approach is consistent with the pre-Evidence Act regime. In Hoch v R (1988) 165 CLR 292, Mason CJ, Wilson and Gaudron JJ wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “Where the happening of the matters said to constitute similar facts is not in dispute and there is evidence to connect the accused person with one or more of the happening evidence of those similar facts may render it objectively improbable that a person other than the accused committed the act in question, that the relevant act was unintended, or that it occurred innocently or fortuitously. Similar fact evidence is then admissible as evidence relevant to that issue.” 
        
       
      
    52    In Pfennig v R ((1995) 182 CLR 461, at 530), McHugh J, referring to “similar fact cases”, wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “In these cases, the propensity of the accused will usually only be established by the verdict.” 
        
       
      
    53    This passage, though directed to “similar fact” evidence, has equal application to propensity, or tendency, evidence. There is nothing in the passage, and nothing in the section, to suggest that the evidence tendered to prove tendency must be of conduct which is established otherwise than through the evidence in the relevant proceedings. It would, of course, be open to the party against whom the evidence was tendered to deny, through evidence, that the person had engaged in the conduct in question; and it may be, in some cases, that discrete issues of fact will arise; and it is not difficult to envisage that proceedings may become rather cumbersome. But that is nothing to do with whether the evidence falls into the category of tendency evidence. I am satisfied that the circumstance that the conduct upon which the Crown seeks to rely has not been admitted, and has not previously been proved, does not operate to prevent it falling into the category of tendency evidence. I am, indeed, satisfied that the evidence upon which the Crown seeks to rely sits comfortably within the definition of tendency evidence as well as the definition of coincidence evidence. 
     
      
       
       • • • 
       
      
    54    That being so, it is necessary to consider the consequential questions of admissibility. In this respect, the admissibility tests being identical, the evidence, considered under the twin rubrics of tendency and coincidence evidence, may be considered together. No issues arise requiring separate consideration. 
     
      
    55    Two admissibility tests specific to tendency and coincidence evidence are imposed by the Evidence Act . Both s 97 and s 98 contain a threshold test, applicable in both civil and criminal cases. Evidence, whether tendency or coincidence, is not to be admitted unless, either alone or in conjunction with other evidence already adduced or to be adduced, it would, in the opinion of the court, have significant probative value.  
     
      
    56    “Probative value” is defined in the Dictionary as meaning: 
     
      
       
        
        “The extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue.” 
        
       
      
    57    In R v Lockyer (1996) 89 A Crim R 457 and subsequently in R v Lock (unreported, 25 March 1997) Hunt CJ at CL expressed the view that the word “significant” should be interpreted as meaning “important”, or “of consequence”, and appeared to agree with the proposition earlier expressed by Dowd J (R v Lewis, unreported, 20 June 1996) that it means something less than “substantial”. His Honour also took the view that the significance of the evidence in question must be assessed by reference to the nature of “the fact in issue” to which it is relevant and the significance or importance which it may have in establishing “the fact in issue”. 
     
      
    58    In order to consider whether a particular piece of evidence has or has not significant probative value, it is necessary to focus, with some precision, upon the “fact [or facts] in issue” to which the evidence is directed.  
     
      
    59    The principal fact in issue, for present purposes, is the identity of the accused as the attacker of any - or all - of the complainants. It may be more accurate to say that, in the case of each complainant, the principal fact in issue is the identity of the accused as the attacker of that complainant. However, it seems to me that another fact, almost certainly in issue (although the accused has not, and has not been required to, disclose his defence or his defence tactics) is whether or not the evidence establishes that it was the same man who attacked all (or some) of the complainants.  
     
      
    60    It is to be borne in mind that, in determining whether the evidence has significant probative value, other evidence with which it may interact is relevant. 
     
      
    61    Firstly, via s 97, the Crown may seek to prove that the accused had a tendency to act in a particular way: for example, by accosting lone women after dark, in one of two limited geographical areas, to threaten them with a knife or similar instrument; to demand and take money; to demand sexual engagement of a very particular kind; to engage in conversation with very particular characteristics; and to leave the victim at the scene after the sexual assault.  
     
      
    62    In relation to each victim, there is some evidence linking the accused with the assault. In many cases there is identification evidence, although the identifications were made with varying degrees of confidence. In the cases of some victims, leaving aside evidence of attacks on other victims, the evidence is weaker than others. However, in relation to two victims, the evidence linking the accused with the crimes appears to be extremely strong. In these cases there is DNA evidence which may be interpreted as establishing that there exists only a one in ten billion chance that the accused was not the assailant. With those cases as a starting point, and taking the description of the attacks given by those victims, the probative value of the evidence is obvious, and somewhat more than significant. The evidence of the circumstances of the attacks on victims other than those two forms part of a chain which a jury might find inculpated the accused in all or some of the attacks.  
     
      
    63    The other approach, via s 98, is for the Crown to seek to prove, because of the improbability that the various attacks occurred coincidentally (that is, were committed by a variety of different individuals) that all (or some) were committed by the same person. Again, if the Crown can show that the accused was the perpetrator of one (or more) of the attacks, then the probative value of the evidence is more than merely significant. In Pfennig it was pointed out that similar fact evidence is a variety of circumstantial evidence (p482) and is, therefore capable of gaining strength from other aspects of the evidence. 
     
      
    64    I am satisfied that nothing in ss97 or 98 precludes the admission of the evidence. 
     
      
    65    The next hurdle imposed by the Evidence Act arises by reason of s 101(2), which applies only in criminal proceedings, and which is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(2) Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant”. 
         
        
       
      
    66    S 101(2) requires an assessment of the probative value of the evidence relative to its prejudicial effect on the accused. The evidence is not admissible unless the former substantially outweighs the latter. Except for the introduction of the adverb “substantially” the section enacts a test not essentially different from that developed by the common law. That this is so is well illustrated by reference to the High Court decision in Pfennig, to which I have already referred. In that case the accused was charged with the murder of a young boy whose body had not been found. The Crown case was that the accused had abducted the boy for sexual purposes and subsequently killed him. The Crown adduced evidence that, on a date after the disappearance of the boy, the accused had abducted and raped another boy a few years older. He had pleaded guilty to the charges in relation to the older boy. The events that gave rise to those charges, and to the plea of guilty, bore similarities, in significant respects, to the events the Crown sought to prove in the murder trial. In their consideration of relevant Australian authorities, the majority in the High Court (Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ) wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was also accepted that, in order to be admissible, propensity evidence must possess ‘a strong degree of probative force’ or the probative force of the evidence must clearly transcend the prejudicial effect of mere criminality or propensity.” ( p 481, internal references omitted) 
        
       
      
    67    The phrase “the probative force of the evidence must clearly transcend the prejudicial effect of mere criminality or propensity” was drawn from an earlier High Court decision, R v Perry (1982) 150 CLR 580. 
     
      
    68    The majority in Pfennig  went on to propose a test of admissibility in the same terms as the test a jury is directed to apply in dealing with circumstantial evidence (that is, whether there is a rational view of the evidence consistent with the innocence of the accused) and wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “Only if there is no such view can one safely conclude that the probative force of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.” (pp482-3) 
        
       
      
    69    Again, their Honours wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “Because propensity evidence may well have a prejudicial effect which is disproportionate to the probative force of that evidence, it is necessary to maintain an insistence on that evidence having a high level or degree of cogency in the circumstances of the particular case.” (p 487) 
        
       
      
    70    Toohey J took a slightly different approach. He quoted from the judgment of Mason CJ, Wilson and Gaudron JJ in Hoch (supra) in which their Honours wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “The criterion of its admissibility is the strength of its probative force.” (p 507) 
        
       
      
    71    However, his Honour went on to identify the task of the trial judge confronted with a question of the tender of such evidence as being: 
     
      
       
        
        “to consider the prejudicial effect of the evidence and whether, in the circumstances, it is just to admit it.” (p507) 
        
       
      
    72    His Honour observed that this was not precisely the same as saying that the evidence is admissible if its probative force exceeds it prejudicial effect. 
     
      
    73    McHugh J wrote that, because the use of propensity reasoning created too great a risk of an unfair trial, the Court had: 
     
      
       
        
        “… insisted that as a matter of law and not discretion the probative value of the evidence must outweigh or transcend its prejudicial effect.” (p528) 
        
       
       
      He added: 
       
       
        
        “The judge must compare the probative strength of the evidence with the degree of risk of an unfair trial if the evidence is admitted. Admitting the evidence will serve the interests of justice only if the judge concludes that the probative force of the evidence compared to the degree of risk of an unfair trial is such that fair minded people would think that the public interest in adducing all relevant evidence of guilt must have priority over the risk of an unfair trial.” (p 529) 
        
       
      
    74    I have set out these passages at some length, because, it seems to me, the criteria for admission of similar fact or propensity evidence at common law that emerges is the test that has been adopted, slightly adapted, and re-stated in s101(2). The addition of the adverb “substantially” is not, however, to be overlooked. The point of this exercise is to demonstrate that, as the common law and statutory tests are essentially of the same kind, decisions as to admissibility made under the common law are not rendered redundant in relation to decisions as to admissibility under the Evidence Act, and that guidance may be obtained from the reasoning in previously decided cases.  
     
      
    75    That leads me back to a number of additional passages to be found in the judgments in Pfennig. The majority wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “Very often, propensity evidence is received when there is a striking similarity between different offences or between the evidence of different witnesses. In particular, it was recognised that the existence of such striking similarity is necessary in cases such as  
        Sutton 
         where the prosecution seeks to lead the evidence on the basis that the similarity between different offences founds a conclusion that they must have been committed by the one person with the consequence that evidence which would be admissible to show that an accused committed one of the offences is admissible to prove that he or she committed another or the others of them.” (481) 
        
       
       
        
        “… evidence of a particular distinctive propensity demonstrated by acts constituting particular manifestations or exemplifications of it will have greater cogency, so long as it has some specific connection with or relation to the issues for decision in the subject case. That evidence, as has been said, will be admissible only if its probative value exceeds it prejudicial effect.” (p 483) 
        
       
       
        
        “Often that high level or degree of cogency is found in the striking similarity, underlying unity or ‘signature’ pattern common to the incidents disclosed by the totality of the evidence.” (p488) 
        
       
      
    76    One passage from Sutton (supra) may also be quoted. Brennan J (as he then was) wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “Striking similarity between the alleged similar fact and the fact to be proved inferentially is a frequent, but not the only, indication of that cogency or that probative force which is required if the evidence is to be taken out of the primary exclusionary rule.” (p549) 
        
       
      
    77    With these principles in mind, I turn to apply the test as stated by the majority in Pfennig. Perhaps rather incongruously, it became necessary to make an evaluation of the evidence which was similar to, or the same as, that which a jury would, if the evidence were admitted, be required to make. But the approach is quite different. That is because, ordinarily, (as in the present exercise) the judge ruling on whether the evidence is to be admitted or not will perform the evaluation on the basis of witness statements or written outlines of the anticipated evidence. The assessment of the probative value of the evidence is less an assessment of the credibility or reliability of the witness (although I do not discount the possibility that that may at times be required), but an assessment of the probative value of the evidence in the context of the evidence of the case as a whole, and on the assumption that the witness is accepted by the jury as credible. 
     
      
    78    Performing that function, I found myself quite satisfied that the evidence meets the stringent test required. I started with the proposition put by counsel for the accused, which is plainly correct, that the evidence will have an enormously prejudicial effect on the accused. To put before a jury evidence designed to establish that an accused person has committed not one, but seven sexual assaults, all having similar characteristics, would be to put a very strong case indeed. The evidence of the offences relating to each individual victim would gather strength from the evidence relating to each of the others. I was under no illusion about the potential prejudicial effect of the evidence of tendency and coincidence. The evidence in relation to each attack would magnify the evidence in relation to each other attack.  
     
      
    79    However, the phrase “prejudicial effect” is apt to create a false impression. All evidence tendered against an accused is intended to have a prejudicial effect, in the sense that it is intended to be part of the evidence which establishes guilt. So it is in the present case. The evidence in question potentially has a powerful prejudicial effect because it tends to establish that the accused was guilty of these very serious offences.  
     
      
    80    It is against that powerful prejudicial effect that the probative value of the evidence must be weighed, keeping firmly in mind that, before it could be admitted, the probative value must not only outweigh its prejudicial effect, but do so substantially. 
     
      
    81    As I have observed above, performing the exercise required involves making an assessment of the probative value of the evidence in the absence of an assessment either of the credibility or the reliability, of the various witnesses, and in the absence of hearing any cross-examination of the Crown witnesses, including those who are expected to give expert evidence. I have no idea what contrary evidence might be produced on behalf of the accused. There are, apart from the tendency and coincidence evidence now under consideration, some important aspects of the evidence to which brief reference should be made (more detailed reference to these matters is to be found elsewhere in this judgment). The Crown has tendered DNA evidence which, on its face, must be taken, virtually unanswerably, certainly overwhelmingly, to implicate the accused in the offences against Complainants 1 and 6. If the tendency and coincidence evidence were considered by the jury sufficient to demonstrate that the same person was responsible for any other attack, then the DNA evidence establishing (if the jury so finds) the accused’s guilt of those offences will also operate to strengthen the Crown evidence against the accused in relation to that other attack. To the DNA evidence may be added evidence of the nature of the offences against Complainants 1 and 6, the circumstances in which the offences were committed, the details of conversation, robbery and so forth. Those details are available to link the accused with offences against other victims, to establish that it was the same person who attacked those other victims. The result is that, in the context of the evidence overall, the probative value of the tendency and coincidence evidence (assuming it to be accepted by the jury) is greater even than its admittedly mighty prejudicial effect. 
     
      
    82    For those reasons, s 101 does not operate to preclude the admission of the tendency and coincidence evidence. 
     
      
    83    In relation to this evidence, counsel finally invoked ss 135 and 137, contained in Part 3.11 of the Evidence Act, which is headed “Discretion to Exclude Evidence”. 
     
      
    84    S 135 confers a true discretion to exclude evidence in either civil or criminal cases, in the circumstances herein outlined. The section provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “The court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party, or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) be misleading or confusing, or 
        
       
       
        
        (c) cause or result in undue waste of time.” 
        
       
      
    85    I did not understand any argument to have been advanced that either paragraph (b) or (c) has application. The argument centred upon the contention that the evidence would be unfairly prejudicial, and that its probative value would be substantially outweighed by the unfair prejudice created. This raises a slightly different issue from that raised by s 101, where the prejudice, to warrant exclusion of the evidence in question, is not required to be “unfair”. Nothing that would render the evidence “unfairly prejudicial” as distinct from “prejudicial” was identified. The mere fact that the evidence strengthens the Crown case does not make it unfairly prejudicial. “The concept” of “unfair prejudice” is concerned with, for example, evidence that an accused person might not be able to meet, or that is likely to have an uwarranted impact on a jury, or lead to improper modes of reasoning. I am unable to perceive any unfair prejudice that might accrue to the accused from the admission of the evidence in question, such as to outweigh its probative value. The precondition to the exercise of the discretion conferred (that the balancing process results in a conclusion that the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighs the probative value of the evidence) has not been established, and, accordingly no occasion arises for the exercise of the discretion envisaged by s 135. 
     
      
    86    S 137 applies only in criminal proceedings. It does not, strictly, confer a discretion, but requires yet again an evaluative process which is akin to the exercise of a discretion. Where the evaluative process results in a conclusion that the probative value of the evidence in question is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused the court is obliged to reject the evidence. 
     
      
    87    For the reasons given above, I can see no danger of unfair prejudice to the accused by the admission of the evidence in question. I can, on the other hand, as indicated above, see great probative value in the evidence. S 137 does not avail the accused.  
     
      
    88    That concludes the matters raised in opposition to the admission of the evidence the Crown proposes to call as tendency and coincidence evidence. I ruled that the evidence, being relevant, probative, and not excluded by any provision of the Evidence Act, it would be admitted in full. 
     
      
       
      2 DNA evidence 
       
      
    89    In relation to two of the complainants, DNA evidence was obtained.  
     
      
       
      (i) Following the sexual assault upon her (which included penile penetration of her vagina) Complainant 1 was taken to Westmead Hospital, where she was examined in accordance with the protocols devised for the investigation of allegations of sexual assault. Forensic swabs were taken from her vulva, vagina and mouth. Those from the vulva and vagina proved positive for seminal fluid which was retained for DNA analysis. An obvious inference is that the semen was the semen of the attacker. A DNA profile was prepared. 
       
       
      (ii) Clothing worn by Complainant 6 was tested for semen and returned a positive result and a DNA profile was taken. It proved to be identical to the profile of the DNA obtained from Complainant 1. 
       
       
      The test results in each case were retained by the investigating police for future use in the event that a suspect was apprehended. 
       
      
    90    On 4 July 2000 Detective Senior Constable Neil Tuckerman assumed command of the investigation into the offences (codenamed “Strike Force Sapelo”). By this time investigators had come to the view, as a result of the DNA evidence obtained in relation to the assaults on Complainants 1 and 6, that those two offences had been committed by the same person. An evaluation of the circumstances and characteristics of the descriptions given by other complainants led investigators to believe that there was a link between the offences committed against at least five of the complainants. (The evidence does not disclose which three of the eight complainants besides Complainants 1 and 6, these were. It does not, for present purposes, matter.) 
     
      
    91    On 7 July Detective Tuckerman issued Operation Orders which named only the accused as a suspect and nominated as the main objective of the operation the subject of those orders “to obtain a DNA sample from [the accused] through covert surveillance”. 
     
      
    92    Officers participating in Strike Force Sapelo maintained surveillance on the accused. On 14 July he was seen to be behaving in a rather unusual fashion. At 7.51 pm he walked into a laneway at Westmead, lay on his stomach for about fifteen seconds, then rose and walked to his car which was parked nearby. He sat in the driver’s seat for about nine minutes. This was not the first incident of unusual behaviour that had been observed. In the morning of 29 June a man (believed to be the accused) had been observed by a resident standing on the ledge of a wall looking into the backyard of a townhouse at Oatlands. The following morning at about the same time the same resident saw the same man emerge from bushes around the adjoining townhouse. On each occasion the man drove off in the same vehicle, the registration number of which was the registration number of the vehicle regularly driven by the accused.  
     
      
    93    As a result of these incidents Detective Tuckerman formed the view that, if the accused were indeed the person responsible for the assaults (or any or some of them), there was a real risk that a ninth attack was imminent.  
     
      
    94    Detective Tuckerman knew that the vehicle the accused drove was unregistered and uninsured. Having taken advice from within the Police Service, he arranged for Constable Scott Glynn, of the Highway Patrol, to stop the vehicle, purportedly in the exercise of routine Highway Patrol duties. At about 8:40 pm on 14 July Constable Glynn did pull up the accused whilst he was driving the vehicle on the M4 Motorway. Constable Glynn told the accused that he had been stopped for the purposes of a “random breath test”. (Whatever else this test was, it was anything but “random”.) He then conducted a breath analysis examination. This required the accused to exhale into a breath test tube. Constable Glynn inspected the accused’s vehicle, observed that the registration label did not carry the appropriate receipt evidencing registration, and arrested the accused and drove him to the Parramatta Police Station. There he issued a Traffic Infringement Notice in relation to three offences under the relevant Road Transport legislation. He sealed the container on which the breath test had been conducted and handed that to another officer. A sample of the accused’s DNA was obtained from the container and a profile prepared. Later comparison with the DNA samples from Complainants 1 and 6 established that the attacker in each case had the same DNA as the accused. The probabilities against the attacker in each case being the accused was put at one in ten billion. 
     
      
    95    At the conclusion of the formalities relating to the Road Transport charges the accused was taken to an interview room where Detectives Tuckerman and Cox were waiting. Between 11.57pm and 12.37am the following morning (that is 15 July) he was interviewed and the interview was electronically recorded. The various allegations of sexual assault were put to him and the accused either declined to answer questions or denied the allegations.  
     
      
    96    At about 4.00 am the accused was released from custody. Detective Tuckerman told him that he had a search warrant for his home address. The accused accompanied police officers to his home where a search began at 4.40 am. It concluded at 6.20 am. 
     
      
    97    The search warrant authorised search and seizure of eighteen described items. Most of these were items of clothing described in the warrant; the others were a 15 cm knife, a pocket knife, an orange handled screwdriver and a mobile phone. The items of clothing conformed with the descriptions, given by the various complainants, of the clothing worn by the attacker. 
     
      
    98    During the course of the search the accused was asked to remove the clothing he was then wearing. This included a pair of shorts, a jacket and a T-shirt. These items, together with others taken during the course of the search, were transferred to the Police Station and treated as exhibits in the investigation. 
     
      
    99    The T-shirt that the accused had been wearing was subjected to a test for DNA. It also yielded a result that established a significant, if not overwhelming, probability that the DNA was that of the assailant of Complainants 1 and 6. 
     
      
    100    On 31 July Detective Tuckerman received information from Ms Michelle Franco, a forensic biologist who conducted the DNA tests on the various items that had been submitted to her. At 6.15 pm that evening he received a preliminary report from her. That report was sufficient to justify the arrest of the accused. It contained the DNA matching mentioned above. The accused was, accordingly, arrested at about 6.40 pm that day. He was taken to Parramatta Police Station where he was again interviewed. A summary of the allegations of each of the complainants was put to him. He maintained his intention to exercise his right to silence. Detective Tuckerman asked him if he was willing to provide a blood sample for DNA comparison tests and the accused declined, citing advice from his solicitor as the reason. He declined to take part in an identification parade. The accused was charged at the conclusion of the interview. 
     
      
    101    After the accused had been charged Detective Tuckerman told him that he was obliged to provide blood or a saliva sample for DNA testing purposes. The accused refused to provide blood. There followed a discussion between Detective Tuckerman and the accused, who continued to refuse to provide a sample.  
     
      
    102    At 12.30 the following morning, 1 August, Detective Campbell pursued the issue of obtaining a blood sample or saliva sample. He gave the accused a copy of s 353A(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 and explained that the section authorised a doctor at the direction of a sergeant or superior officer to obtain a sample. The accused continued to refuse. Dr Stewart was present throughout this conversation. 
     
      
    103    At about 3.00pm the same day detectives returned to the issue. On this occasion Dr Moynham, a police medical officer, Detective Inspector McKay, and other police officers attended the clinic at the Corrective Services Cells at Parramatta where they saw the accused. The entitlement to take a blood sample was again explained to the accused, and he again refused. Detective Inspector McKay told him that police were permitted to use force to obtain the sample by injection but that they preferred to take a saliva swab from his mouth. By this time the accused had spoken to solicitors and had received advice. Eventually he agreed to provide a saliva sample (buccal swabs). Testing of these swabs had the same result as the earlier obtained DNA samples. It established a high, indeed overwhelming, probability that the accused was the man who had assaulted Complainants 1 and 6. 
     
      
       
       • • • 
       
      
    104    The accused seeks the exclusion of the evidence of the DNA obtained as a result of breath analysis test, the sweat ingrained T-shirt, and the buccal swab. Although, in each case, objection is based on discretionary matters, the factual and other issues that arise are not identical.  
     
      
       
      The breath test container 
       
      
    105    The argument advanced on behalf of the accused in relation to the DNA evidence obtained as a result of the breath test was that the sample was obtained by trickery, by subterfuge, and that it resulted from the improper exercise of the power to arrest. The accused does not dispute that he was in fact guilty of the motor vehicle offences with which he was charged. Counsel provided a copy of s 18 of the Road Transport (Vehicle Registration) Act 1997 which creates the offence of using an unregistered registrable vehicle on a road, and which provides for a maximum penalty of twenty penalty units. One aspect of the argument advanced on behalf of the accused was that, by reference to the penalty, that offence should be seen as one low on the calendar of criminal offences, and one which should be prosecuted, not by arrest and charge, but by summons. 
     
      
    106    I accept that the penalty provided for by the legislature does not suggest that the offence of driving an unregistered vehicle is at the high end of the scale of criminal offences. I further accept that prosecutions for less serious offences may properly be initiated in the usual course by summons rather than by arrest and charge. However, on this occasion the accused was apprehended in the act of committing the offences. In such circumstances an arrest, at least to prevent the continuation of the commission of the offences, or commission of further offences, seems to me to be not inappropriate. S 352 of the Crimes Act 1900 provides the statutory authorities for arrest in those circumstances. 
     
      
    107    I am quite satisfied that the arrest of the accused in relation to the road traffic charges was no more than a pretext. Although the accused was issued with a Traffic Infringement Notice, the dominant and real purpose of the arrest was to obtain, by covert means, a sample of the accused’s DNA, so that it could be compared with the DNA of the man who had assaulted Complainants 1 and 6. Neither Detective Tuckerman nor Constable Glynn pretended otherwise. The true purpose for which the power to arrest was exercised was not the enforcement of the road traffic laws; it was to enable police to obtain a sample of the accused’s bodily fluids to enable DNA matching to take place. 
     
      
    108    Counsel argued that, in those circumstances, the evidence comes within s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995 and ought, on the application of that section, be excluded. S 138 relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        138. Exclusion of improperly or illegally obtained evidence 
          
         
        (1) 
         Evidence that was obtained:  
         
        (a) improperly or in contravention of an Australian law, or  
         
        (b) in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law,  
         
        is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained.  
         
         
        (2) 
         … 
         
         
        (3) 
         Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account under subsection (1), it is to take into account:  
         
        (a) the probative value of the evidence, and  
         
        (b) the importance of the evidence in the proceeding, and  
         
        (c) the nature of the relevant offence, cause of action or defence and the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and  
         
        (d) the gravity of the impropriety or contravention, and  
         
        (e) whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless, and  
         
        (f) whether the impropriety or contravention was contrary to or inconsistent with a right of a person recognised by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and  
         
        (g) whether any other proceeding (whether or not in a court) has been or is likely to be taken in relation to the impropriety or contravention, and  
         
        (h) the difficulty (if any) of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law.  
        
       
       
      
    109    There are, in fact, two questions that arise when s 138 is invoked. The first is whether the evidence is evidence obtained improperly or in contravention of an Australian law, or in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law. If that question is not answered affirmatively, then the s 138 balancing process does not arise. It is only if the evidence is properly characterised as evidence of that kind that the second question, whether the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence obtained in the way the particular evidence under consideration was obtained, arises.  
     
      
       
      Impropriety 
       
      
    110    I have attempted to make it perfectly plain that I am satisfied that the powers conferred on police officers under road traffic legislation were used for a purpose essentially extraneous to the purpose for which they were conferred. The purpose for which the power to arrest is conferred to enforce the law. In this case, the power to arrest was purportedly to enforce the road transport law. That was not at the forefront of Detective Tuckerman’s mind, and was not the true reason Constable Glynn arrested and charged the accused.  
     
      
    111    It was not, however, in issue that the accused was in fact driving a vehicle in breach of the road transport legislation. The police officers were entitled to arrest him, and charge him under that legislation. Nor was it in issue that, he having been apprehended in the course of committing offences under that legislation, they were entitled to require him to submit to a breath analysis. There was, accordingly, no contravention of any Australian law. The question remains whether the exercise of the very serious power of arrest, and the consequent breath analysis amounts, in the circumstances, to an impropriety.  
     
      
    112    Having regard to all of the circumstances, I am not satisfied that there was an impropriety. It would be different if police had manufactured a false charge, or had arrested the accused purportedly for an offence which they knew he had not committed. That was not the case here. Police had good reason to believe that the accused had committed the offences charged, (ie the road transport offences) and, indeed, was in the process of continuing to commit the offences. 
     
      
    113    Further, in assessing whether there was any impropriety, it is relevant to consider the urgency of the task that police were performing. It is of some significance that surveillance police had observed the accused to be acting in a fashion that gave them reason to fear (if not believe) that, if he were the offender, there was a risk of a further, and imminent, attack or attacks. The protection of another victim, or other victims, is of no small moment in the assessment of the propriety of the conduct of the police officers.  
     
      
    114    Ordinarily such a use of the power of arrest would properly be regarded as an abuse of power and amount to a significant impropriety. Two things counterbalance what would otherwise be an inevitable conclusion. Firstly, by engaging in the conduct (driving an unregistered and uninsured vehicle) the accused exposed himself to proper arrest and detention. It is not as though police fabricated an allegation for the purpose of the arrest. Secondly, police had good reason to believe, not only that the accused was the perpetrator of seven sexual assaults, and their associated armed robberies, but also that his behaviour was such that there was a real danger that he would attack again. A further female victim was (or further female victims were) at significant risk if the perpetrator was not stopped. This is a factor of considerable importance in the evaluation of the police conduct and in the measure of censure that ought to be attached to it. 
     
      
    115    Moreover, it is relevant to consider the reliability of the evidence so obtained. The reliability of DNA evidence is, as I understand it, generally regarded as high. There was no real danger, by reason of the way in which the evidence was obtained, that its reliability would be affected. DNA is used, not only to obtain incriminatory evidence; it is capable, also, of exculpating the innocent, and it not infrequently does so. Obtaining samples of the accused’s bodily fluids for the purpose of comparison with those samples the offender had left with two of his victims was likely to do one of two things: to eliminate the accused as a suspect, or to confirm, or at least heighten, the suspicion that he was the person responsible for at least two of the attacks. 
     
      
    116    Another consideration is the degree of intrusion involved in the way the sample of bodily fluid was taken. This was, in the case of the breath analysis, minimal. 
     
      
    117    Notwithstanding my misgivings about the police use of the powers of arrest in this case, having regard to all the circumstances I am not satisfied that the evidence it yielded was improperly obtained, or obtained in consequence of an impropriety. 
     
      
    118    Even if it were otherwise, I would be satisfied that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence so obtained. My reasons for this conclusion are essentially the same as the reasons for doubting that it is evidence improperly obtained. I shall re-state them. They are: 
     
      
       
      (i) that the accused was in fact guilty of the offences under colour of which he was arrested and detained; 
       
      (ii) that police had reason to believe that, if their suspicions that the accused was the perpetrator of the assaults (or some of them) were correct, there was a danger that he would attack again;  
       
      (iii) that there was nothing in the manner in which the evidence was obtained that was likely adversely to affect its reliability; 
       
      (iv) that there was only minimal personal intrusion involved in obtaining the sample; 
       
      (v) that the evidence to be obtained was such that it was likely to confirm police suspicions and justify an arrest on the major charges, or to eliminate the accused from the enquiry. 
       
      
    119    These reasons translate readily into the matters specified as matters that must be taken into account pursuant to s 138 (3). For completeness I will express my reason in terms of that sub section, referring to those sub paragraphs that are material: 
     
      
      (a) the probative value of the evidence is extremely high; 
       
      (b) the evidence is extremely important in the proceedings; it is of critical importance in the charges involving Complainants 1 and 6. Having concluded that coincidence evidence was admissible, and that, if the jury accepted that some or all of the offences were committed by the same person, the DNA evidence incriminates the accused not only in relation to those offences, but also in relation to the offences committed upon such other of the complainants as the jury were satisfied were committed by the man who attacked one or other of those two complainants; 
       
      (c) the offences are very serious; the offences of aggravated sexual assault carry a maximum penalty of imprisonment for twenty years; 
       
      (d) to the extent that there was an impropriety (contrary to my assessment), it was, having regard to all the circumstances, not grave; 
       
      (e) while the police officers did what they did with full knowledge of their motives, they obtained advice as to the legality of their actions; 
       
      (h) given the pressure upon them, and the time constraints, it would have been difficult for police to obtain samples of the accused’s bodily fluids for DNA purposes without resort to the kind of action they took. 
       
      
    120    Counsel for the accused also argued that the obtaining of the evidence in the way police did was contrary to or inconsistent with a right recognised by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a circumstance relevant to s 138(3)(f). He referred to Article 9 of the Covenant, which precludes arbitrary arrest or detention and requires a person arrested to be informed, at the time of the arrest, of the reasons for the arrest, and to be properly informed of any charges preferred. 
     
      
    121    I do not think that the accused’s arrest on 14 July could be described as “arbitrary”. He was arrested because he was in the process of committing offences. He was informed of the reason for that arrest. The fact that the arrest had a wider purpose does not affect the fact that it was a lawful, and not an arbitrary, arrest. I am satisfied that, balancing all of the relevant factors, the desirability of admitting the evidence substantially outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence obtained by the exercise of a power of arrest for an ulterior purpose. 
     
      
    122    In my opinion, the fears police held of another attack, and the reasons for those fears, constituted an important extenuating circumstance affecting whether the behaviour should be classed as an impropriety, and if it should, the level of the impropriety, and the consequences that should attach to any such impropriety. I would be much less inclined to take a benign view of what police did and to admit the evidence, if they were not under pressure, not only to identify and apprehend a man guilty of these serious offences, but to ensure that the pattern of offences did not continue and involve additional victims. 
     
      
    123    By repeating this, I intend to dispel any notion that the view I have taken in this case amounts to an endorsement of the use of the power of arrest for an ulterior purpose or to a finding that the end justifies the means. It would be only in a most exceptional case that I would consider that the use of the power of arrest and detention for an ulterior purpose could be condoned. This is such a case. 
     
      
       
      The T-shirt 
       
      
    124    The point that was made in relation to the DNA sample obtained from the T-shirt the accused was wearing at the time of his arrest, and during the course of the execution of the search warrant at his home, was that the T-shirt was obtained, purportedly pursuant to a search warrant, but that it was not one of the eighteen items enumerated on the search warrant. It was therefore obtained either in breach of the law governing the execution of search warrants, or improperly as a result of excessive zeal in the execution of the warrant.  
     
      
    125    The evidence in this respect is not very clear. The T-shirt that the accused was wearing is described in Detective Tuckerman’s statement as “one mustard coloured JAG jeans brand ‘T-shirt’”. The search warrant nominates, inter alia, the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. one light coloured short sleeved polo shirt with horizontal stripes. 
        
       
       
        
        5. one grey coloured T-shirt with NIKE motif in blue on front. 
        
       
       
        
        6. one light coloured sweat style shirt. 
        
       
       
        
        7. one grey T-shirt with red coloured printing.” 
        
       
       
      
    126    On the voir dire Detective Tuckerman was cross-examined about this. He identified the “light coloured sweat style shirt’, item 6 in the search warrant, as conforming with the shirt the accused had been wearing. 
     
      
    127    I was in no position, on these limited descriptions, to assess whether the shirt taken from the accused, did, or might have, come within the description of item 6 sufficiently to justify its being taken pursuant to the search warrant. I was far from satisfied that it did not. 
     
      
    128    In cross-examination on the voir dire Detective Tuckerman acknowledged that consideration had been given to obtaining clothing worn by the accused for the purpose of DNA testing, and that he expected that, after the accused had been in custody at the police station for some time, interviewed, and taken to his home which was searched in his presence, it was likely that the T-shirt he had been wearing throughout these events would be impregnated with perspiration and that that would be likely to yield substances suitable for DNA testing. Detective Tuckerman maintained that the T-shirt was conceivably identifiable as one of the items listed in the search warrant and that this was at least an equal reason for its confiscation.  
     
      
    129    However, I am satisfied that the dominant reason for taking the clothing was to obtain a sample of the accused’s bodily fluids to permit DNA testing. 
     
      
    130    The basis on which counsel for the accused sought to have the evidence excluded was, again, s 138 of the Evidence Act. Again, I am not satisfied that there was an impropriety or a contravention of an Australian law, or that any evidence has been obtained in consequence of such an impropriety or contravention. The execution of the search warrant was a legitimate tool in the investigation of the sexual assaults. It was not executed for the purpose of obtaining a DNA sample from the accused, although its finding might have been manipulated to enable that to happen, and it is very unlikely that the warrant was executed in such a way as to cause some agitation to the accused, thereby making it more likely that he would perspire freely. Accordingly, the s 138 evaluation does not arise. Even it were established that the warrant did not authorise the taking of the T-shirt and that its confiscation amounted to a contravention of law, I would, again, be satisfied that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence obtained in such a fashion. 
     
      
    131    In relation to both the DNA taken from the breath test container, and the T-shirt, it is to be observed that DNA evidence was also taken from the buccal swab and that, if this is to be admitted, the relative importance of the DNA evidence from the other two items is somewhat diminished. However, in my opinion, the evidence remains, as I have observed above, important. The discretionary considerations in relation to this DNA evidence are similar to those that relate to the breath test DNA evidence. 
     
      
       
      The buccal swab. 
       
      
    132    S 353A (2) of the Crimes Act provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “When a person is in lawful custody upon a charge of committing any crime or offence which is of such a nature and is alleged to have been committed under such circumstances that there are reasonable grounds for believing that an examination of his or her person will afford evidence as to the commission of the crime or offence, any legally qualified medical practitioner acting at the request of any officer of police of or above the rank of sergeant, and any person acting in good faith in his or her aid and under his or her direction, may make such an examination of the person so in custody as is reasonable in order to ascertain the facts which may afford such evidence.” 
        
       
      
    133    The advice, or the interpretation of s 353A(2) given to the accused by police officers on 31 July and 1 August, was a correct interpretation of this sub section. The section is designed to permit the taking of body samples such as saliva or blood for the purpose, inter alia, of DNA testing. At the time the buccal swab was taken the accused was in custody; and he was in custody upon a charge of committing a crime of such a nature and alleged to have been committed under such circumstances that reasonable grounds existed for believing that examination of his person would afford evidence as to the commission of the crime. 
     
      
    134    Prima facie, therefore, the sub section authorised the taking of the sample. 
     
      
    135    However, the argument that was put on behalf of the accused was that he came to be in custody solely as a result of the taking of the previous samples of bodily fluid which was, on the argument put on behalf of the accused, improper or unlawful. Counsel for the accused asserted, in effect, a different but related claim of impropriety. 
     
      
    136    It is obvious that the accused’s argument in relation to the buccal swabs depends upon a finding that both of the previous samples were improperly or illegally taken. Given the conclusions I have reached and expressed in relation to those matters, there is little left of this argument. 
     
      
    137    However, I would add that, even if I were wrong on all counts in relation to those matters, it would not affect my view that the buccal swab was taken lawfully in the exercise of the power conferred by s 353A(2). The accused was in lawful custody on a relevant charge at that time. Even if the arrest had been effected in reliance upon improperly or illegally obtained evidence, or evidence which would later prove to be inadmissible or rejected in the exercise of discretion, that did not affect the legality of his arrest. Accordingly, there is no place for the exercise of the s 138 evaluation. There is no impropriety or illegality in the taking of the buccal swab. 
     
      
    138    As I have earlier mentioned, the consequence of this conclusion is that the importance of the earlier DNA evidence is somewhat diminished, but not to the point at which a reconsideration of the views earlier expressed results in any alteration on modification of those views. 
     
      
    139    In considering the matters raised in relation to all matters, but, particularly, the DNA evidence, I have not overlooked the decisions of the High Court in R v Swaffield; R v Pavic [1998] HCA 1; 192 CLR 159. In those cases the High Court considered at length the exercise of “the fairness discretion” in the admission of evidence of confessional material (which is strictly admissible but subject to discretionary exclusion) in criminal trials. Although those decisions were concerned with confessional evidence, the principles stated are not, in my view limited to evidence of that kind, but have potential application to any evidence obtained in such circumstances that its fairness is questionable. Both appeals, however, emanated from jurisdictions other than NSW, and were not therefore governed by the precise provisions now contained in the Evidence Act. The decisions must be read in the light of the Evidence Act, but are of obvious materiality in providing guidance in the exercise of the various discretions based upon fairness (however expressed) contained in that Act. Indeed, in the majority judgment, Toohey, Gaudron and Gummow JJ referred to the NSW Evidence Act ([68]). Parallel with, and perhaps overlapping with, the fairness discretion is what Brennan CJ called “the public policy discretion”. I have considered whether there is anything in the reasoning in Swaffield and Pavic that should alter the view I have taken. I am satisfied that, even applying the broader approach set out in those cases, there was nothing in the manner in which the evidence was obtained that would require its exclusion either in terms of fairness, or for public policy reasons.  
     
      
    140    I ruled that all evidence relating to DNA testing would be admitted. 
     
      
       
      3 Picture identification 
       
      
    141    The accused sought the exclusion of identification of the accused made by complainants 4, 5 and 7 from photographs. It will be necessary to set out the circumstances in which the identifications were made.  
     
      
    142    As has been set out above the accused was arrested by Constable Glynn at about 8.40 pm on 14 July 2000. So far as I can ascertain from the statements, he remained in custody in relation to those charges until about 9.15 pm. He was then taken to an interview room where he was introduced to Detectives Tuckerman and Cox. Detective Tuckerman told the accused that they were making enquiries into a number of sexual assaults and robberies. In my view, at this time the accused was under arrest in relation to the sexual assaults and robberies. The purpose of the arrest and consequent detention was to enable the officers of Strike Force Sapelo to investigate his involvement in the commission of those offences. The statutory authority for such detention is to be found in Part 10A of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
    143    The accused remained in that custody until 4.00 am the following morning, 15 July.  
     
      
    144    At about 1.00 am on 15 July, at the request of police, Complainant 7 attended at the Parramatta Police Station where she participated in what has been called photograph identification. Complainant 7 was shown fourteen photographs, which included a photograph of the accused, and was invited to identify any of the photographs she recognised as a photograph of the person who had committed the assault upon her. She selected the photograph of the accused. The entire process was recorded on video tape.  
     
      
    145    At about 2.30 am Detective Krawczyk and Constable Shepherd went to the home of Complainant 5. They were in possession of the same fourteen photographs and went through the same process with Complainant 5. She also selected the photograph of the accused. This process also was recorded on video tape.  
     
      
    146    In each case the photograph of the accused used was one taken from police records, have come into existence as the result of an earlier arrest of the accused. It was the most recent photograph in the possession of police. 
     
      
    147    On 27 July 2000 Complainant 4 went to the Parramatta Police Station. After dealing with some other matters, to which reference will be made below, she also was shown the fourteen photographs and also selected the photograph of the accused. This process also was recorded on video tape. 
     
      
    148    Having regard to the challenge to this evidence, it will be necessary shortly to refer in some more detail to what appears on the video tape. 
     
      
    149    The first challenge, however, to the evidence concerned s 115 of the Evidence Act which is concerned with what is called “picture identification evidence”. The evidence under consideration is evidence of that kind, within the definition contained in sub s (1). Sub ss(3), (4) and (5) are material. They provide as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (3) 
         Subject to subsection (4), picture identification evidence adduced by the prosecutor is not admissible if:  
         
        (a) when the pictures were examined, the defendant was in the custody of a police officer of the police force investigating the commission of the offence with which the defendant has been charged, and  
         
        (b) the picture of the defendant that was examined was made before the defendant was taken into that police custody.  
         
         
        (4) 
         Subsection (3) does not apply if:  
         
        (a) the defendant's appearance had changed significantly between the time when the offence was committed and the time when the defendant was taken into that custody, or  
         
        (b) it was not reasonably practicable to make a picture of the defendant after the defendant was taken into that custody.  
         
         
        (5) 
         Picture identification evidence adduced by the prosecutor is not admissible if, when the pictures were examined, the defendant was in the custody of a police officer of the police force investigating the commission of the offence with which the defendant has been charged, unless:  
         
        (a) the defendant refused to take part in an identification parade, or  
         
        (b) the defendant's appearance had changed significantly between the time when the offence was committed and the time when the defendant was taken into that custody, or  
         
        (c) it would not have been reasonable to have held an identification parade that included the defendant.  
        
       
       
      Sub s (3) prima facie precludes the admission of picture identification evidence adduced by the Crown if, at the time the identification process took place, the person accused was in the custody of an officer of the police force investigating the commission of the offence charged and the photograph of the accused contained in the array of photographs shown to the witness or witnesses was made before the accused was taken into that custody. Those circumstances apply here. The photograph of the accused that was used was a photograph in the possession of police and taken before his arrest on 14 July. As he was in custody at the time Complainants 5 and 7 examined the photographs, prima facie sub s (3) renders evidence of that identification inadmissible. 
       
      
    150    However, sub s (4) provides two exceptions, one only of which is presently relevant. That is the exception provided in sub para (b). Detective Tuckerman gave an explanation for using that photograph of the accused. He said that he chose it out of fairness to the accused, it being the most recent photograph of him in the possession of police. 
     
      
    151    In my opinion it is clear that Detective Tuckerman was, in part, acting under a misapprehension as to his powers. In evidence he said that he did not believe that he had the power or authority to take a photograph of the accused without the accused’s consent. In my opinion that is an incorrect understanding of the relevant provisions of the Crimes Act. S353A(3) provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “(3) When a person is in lawful custody for any offence punishable on indictment or summary conviction, the officer in charge of police at the station where the person is so in custody may take or cause to be taken all such particulars as may be deemed necessary for the identification of such person, including, where the person is of or above the age of fourteen years, the person’s photograph and fingerprints and palm prints.” 
        
       
      
    152    In my opinion it is quite plain that the accused was, from about 9.15 pm, on 14 July, “in lawful custody for [offences] punishable on indictment” those offences being the various offences of sexual assault and robbery and kidnapping. The subsection therefore authorised the taking of a photograph. That photograph could be used for the purposes of identification in the way the photographs were in fact used: R v McPhail and Tivey (1988) 36 A Crim R 390. The plain words of sub s (3) require this interpretation. In case there is any doubt (as was expressed by the Crown during the course of argument) the opening words of sub s (3) are to be contrasted with the opening words of the preceding sub sections. Sub ss (1) and (2) both open with the words:  
     
      
       
        
        “Where a person is in lawful custody  
        upon a charge 
          
         committing any crime or offence …” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    153    Sub s (3) envisages custody without charge as contemplated by Part 10A. I am therefore satisfied that the view of the law taken by Detective Tuckerman was erroneous and that he had the power to take a photograph of the accused with or without his consent. 
     
      
    154    However, that does not dispose of s 115(3). The exception provided in sub s (4) (b) focuses upon the reasonable practicability of photo-graphing the accused after he has been taken into custody. In evidence Detective Tuckerman referred to a number of matters that made it plain that it was not reasonably practicable to do so within the time available. Firstly, Detective Tuckerman was engaged at a police station which was not his normal place of work. He was, of course, aware that police stations are equipped with facilities for the taking of photographs. However, he was of the opinion that, the photographic examinations having commenced at about 1.30 am, it would not have been reasonably practicable to have a photograph taken of the accused and processed in order to enable the identifications to proceed. In the witness box he gave consideration to the possibility that an instant print Polaroid type camera might have been available in the police station, but pointed out that such cameras produce a photograph with a different appearance from those ordinarily held by police. If a Polaroid photograph of the accused were to have been taken, and photographs already in possession of police used to complete the array, the prejudice to the accused by reason of the inevitable attention given to the one photograph that was different is manifest. That would have made it necessary, as Detective Tuckerman pointed out, to make up an array of photographs of other men of similar age, colouring, and facial characteristics all taken on the Polaroid camera; and this during the early hours of the morning. In any event, there is no reason to believe that a Polaroid camera was available. 
     
      
    155    I accepted that, in the circumstances, it was not reasonably practicable to “make a picture” of the accused after he was taken into custody. 
     
      
    156    Two matters that were put on behalf of the accused should be mentioned. Firstly, counsel suggested that the impracticability of photographing the accused was not in Detective Tuckerman’s mind and was not, in truth, the reason or even a reason for the course that he adopted. This may well be true, and indeed I thought that it probably was. His misunderstanding of his right to take a photograph established, to my satisfaction that he did not turn his mind to the reasonable practicability of taking a photograph of the accused. But sub s (4)(b) is not directed to the motivation or state of mind of the police officer; it is directed to the objective reasonable practicability or otherwise of taking a photograph. Whether Detective Tuckerman thought about it at the time or not, it was not reasonably practicable to take a photograph of the accused - at least one that could be used for photographic identification purposes at that time. 
     
      
    157    Secondly, it was argued that there was no real necessity for the urgency which Detective Tuckerman perceived, and that the photographic identification could have been delayed until it was possible to take a photograph that conformed with the prima facie requirement of s 115. The simple answer to this proposition is that s 115 does not require or contemplate deferring the examination until a photograph can be made available.  
     
      
    158    Further, I was satisfied, (contrary to the submissions) that there was a degree of urgency associated with the photographic identification of the accused. He was, at that time, in custody pursuant to Part 10A, and this afforded police limited time for their investigations. In order to have sufficient evidence to justify charging the accused (or to eliminate him from the enquiry) it was necessary for police to conduct the identification investigations with expedition. 
     
      
    159    Sub s(5) does not operate to exclude the evidence because the accused refused, when asked, to take part in an identification parade. 
     
      
    160    I was therefore satisfied that there is no reason associated with the provisions of s 115 not to admit the evidence of photographic identification.  
     
      
    161    I pause here to note that these considerations do not apply in the case of Complainant 4, who examined the photographs on 27 July, a time when the accused was not in police custody. 
     
      
    162    The next argument advanced on behalf of the accused in relation to the photographic identification evidence was made in reliance on the discretions conferred by ss 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act. In each case the argument focused upon the probative value of the evidence. Put shortly, it was suggested that close examination of the video of the photographic examination would disclose unfairness in the conduct of the police officers who provided the photographs to the complainants. The suggestion was that by subtle hints or gestures the police officers influenced the selection of the photographs of the accused. 
     
      
    163    I have viewed each video tape. Indeed, during the course of the voir dire, counsel for the accused, with the use of the remote control device of the video machine, played and re-played those portions of the videos on which he relied to suggest influence of the kind he claimed had taken place. I was quite unable to detect any such influence. In my opinion each identification was conducted with scrupulous fairness on the part of the police officers concerned. I do not propose to deal in detail with the contents of each video tape. I do note that the voices on the video tape are at times extremely indistinct. However, counsel having viewed the videos on even more occasions than I have, pointed specifically to those parts of the video which were said to be evidence of unfairness of the kind asserted. In no case did I accept that there was such unfairness. 
     
      
    164    I proposed to admit the evidence of photographic identification. 
     
      
       
      4 Voice identification evidence 
       
      
    165    As part of the identification police officers undertook a rather unusual (at least in my experience) voice identification exercise. The accused’s voice had been recorded when he was interviewed on 14 July. Police extracted a portion of that interview and deleted some parts of the extract in order to produce a reasonably free flowing recording of the accused’s voice. They were careful to select a portion that did not give rise to any assumptions about the accused. 
     
      
    166    They then prepared a script in identical terms and sought the assistance of eleven men they spoke to in the Parramatta Mall. Each of the eleven men returned to the Parramatta Police Station and read the script. Each reading was recorded on the same equipment as had been used earlier to record the accused’s voice. The result was that police had in their possession twelve tape recordings, each of a male voice, each using identical words, and each recorded on identical equipment. The aim of this exercise was to create a voice identification process parallel, so far as possible, with an identification parade, or photograph identification.  
     
      
    167    Each recording was then played to each complainant, and each was asked, in a manner analogous to the photograph identification, to say whether she recognised the voice of the man who had attacked her. In each case the process was recorded on video tape. The accused’s voice was the voice recorded on the tape numbered 12, although the tapes were not necessarily played to the complainants in numerical sequence. Complainant 1 selected two voices, one of which was the voice of the accused. Complainant 3 similarly selected two voices, one of which was that of the accused. Complainant 4 selected only the voice of the accused and expressed herself as “very positive” that this voice was similar to that of her attacker and that it had been familiar to her when she first heard the tape recording. She added that when the tape was first played to her she “became uneasy and [her] heart started racing”, and that none of the other tapes had had that effect upon her. Complainant 6 selected three tape recordings, one of which contained the voice of the accused. She was unable to say with any certainty that any of these voices was the voice of her attacker but said that each was similar. Complainant 7 identified only the voice of the accused and expressed herself as “positive that this male’s voice was very similar to the male” who had assaulted her. She also said that after hearing the voice she became very upset.  
     
      
    168    Criticisms of a similar kind to those made in relation to the photographic identification were made of the voice identifications were made of the voice identification process. The criticisms were directed to challenging the probative value of the evidence so obtained. There were, potentially, some defects in the process. The most glaring of these was that the recording of the accused was a recording of him using words of his own selection, in a natural fashion, and therefore having the rhythm and cadence of ordinary speech. The recordings of some, at least, of the other men lack that natural rhythm and are discernibly recordings of men reading the script rather than speaking naturally. Further, despite the precautions taken by police in using the same equipment, the quality of the recording of the accused’s voice is different from the quality of the other recordings. In other words, the recording of the accused’s voice has some features which distinguish it from the recordings of the others.  
     
      
    169    I regarded these deficiencies as minor, When I use the word “deficiencies” I do not intend to express any criticism of the police officers. Such deficiencies as there were were brought about by the exigencies of the circumstances and could not, in my view, have been avoided. Moreover, they are, as I have said, minor. The tape recording of the accused’s voice does have a different quality and sound to the tape recording of the other voices; and the men who read from the script provided to them, in some cases at least, did not do so very convincingly. However, the whole process was video taped, and one thing that emerges from the video tapes is the close and careful attention each complainant paid to each of the tape recordings. Most listened to at least some of the recordings a number times and went through a process of elimination. Only two of the complainants whose voice identification evidence is in issue chose the accused’s voice alone; each of the others also selected at least one other voice. This did not suggest to me that the complainants were directed intentionally or unintentionally to the accused’s voice. 
     
      
    170    As with the photographic identification, the video recording in each case provides cause for confidence that the process was undertaken with scrupulous fairness. Specific points were made about the identification by different complainants and it was suggested that, in different cases, the police officer conducting the exercise gave subtle hints which influences the selection. Such is not the impression I received.  
     
      
    171    The challenge to this evidence was made in reliance upon the discretionary provisions of ss 135 and 137. Again, what was challenged was the “probative value” of the evidence. In my opinion the argument proceeded on a misapprehension of the concept of “probative value” as used in those sections. 
     
      
    172    In my opinion those sections were not intended to substitute the opinion of a judge for the evaluation of the jury as to the credibility or the weight of the evidence. Rather, the words “probative value” in those sections is generally, intended to refer to the extent to which the challenged evidence, if accepted as credible, would affect the strength (or otherwise) of the Crown case. In other words, “probative value” in those sections is a reference to the importance of the evidence relative to other pieces of evidence in the Crown case. 
     
      
    173    In my opinion the evidence of the five complainants is of significant probative value (assuming the jury accept it as credible); of course, the probative value is greater according to the degree of certainty expressed by any particular complainant, and greater again where only one voice has been nominated. 
     
      
    174    I ruled that the voice identification evidence would be admitted. 
     
      
       
      5 Object identification 
       
      
    175    This concerns the process undertaken by which each of the complainants was invited to view an array of clothing, and an array of knives and screw drivers, and to nominate any of those items she recognised as having been worn or used by her attacker. It is unnecessary to detail the specific results of this process. It was, like the other investigative procedures, fully recorded on video tape. In some cases complainants, with varying degrees of certainty or hesitation, selected items of clothing as similar to items of clothing worn by their assailants; and in some cases individual complainants selected knives or a screw driver as being similar to those used by their assailants. 
     
      
    176    In relation to the knives on display, and, indeed, the screw drivers, it may be observed that they are patently very ordinary household items, which would be likely to be found in virtually any household in the country. 
     
      
    177    Similarly, the clothing array, though extensive, is relatively unremarkable. It consists of a number of jackets, shirts and T-shirts and pairs of shorts.  
     
      
    178    There is one feature which limits the value of the evidence obtained in this way. All of the clothing was clothing taken from the accused’s home following the execution of the search warrant. All of the knives and screw drivers were taken from the accused’s home at the same time. In other words, whatever items were identified by the complainants, they were items which belonged to the accused. The evidence, therefore, does not have decisive value as fixing the accused with responsibility for any attack, as it would have done, if, for example, amongst an array of clothing and implements taken from a combination of sources other than the accused, a complainant had positively identified his clothing or implements. 
     
      
    179    But, in my opinion, the evidence potentially has some (although limited) probative value. The weight to be assigned to it is, of course, a matter for the jury. 
     
      
    180    I proposed to admit the evidence of object identification.

    1 HIS HONOUR: The summons purportedly commences criminal proceedings in this court in its summary jurisdiction. The summons is in the form prescribed for that purpose: Form 74A. The plaintiffs seek directions as to service. 
    2 The only criminal proceedings which may be commenced by summons in this court are proceedings for offences that may be tried in the court’s summary jurisdiction. That jurisdiction is limited to cases where jurisdiction is given to the court by a statute. This situation arises from s 3(1) of the Supreme Court (Summary Jurisdiction) Act 1967, which provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        3. (1) Where, under any Act, proceedings for an offence may be taken before the Court in its summary jurisdiction, the Court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine those proceedings in a summary manner. 
        
       
      
    3 The summons does not sufficiently specify the offences charged. It should accordingly be struck out.  
    4 The plaintiffs should have leave to file an amended summons, on terms which I will specify. 
    5 The orders are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) Summons struck out;

         (a) each alleged offence should be specified with clarity and precision in a separate numbered paragraph; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (b) the paragraph in relation to each offence should also specify the statutory provision (if any) by which this court is given jurisdiction to try the offence in its summary jurisdiction (stating the name of the statute and the section which gives this court jurisdiction in relation to the particular offence).

        REGINA v MACLEOD 
        
        
        HEADNOTE 
        
        
       The appellant was charged with and tried on twenty-five charges, of which six were alternatives to six primary charges. He was convicted of nineteen counts. The charges were brought under various State and Commonwealth statutory provisions. 
        
        
       The appellant was a director of three companies - Trainex Pty Limited (“Trainex”), Starlight Film Studios Limited (“Starlight”) and Communications Entertainment Network Limited. Through these companies he conducted an enterprise, purportedly making films and videos, in which he invited others to invest, with a view to obtaining taxation advantages offered by Part 111, Division 10 B of the  
       Income Assessment Act 
        1936. Several thousand investors accepted the invitation, contributing, in total, more than $6,000,000. Of this, only $718,000 was used to make films. More than $2,000,000 was applied to the appellant’s own benefit, including purchasing a Queensland home unit in his name. Investors were furnished with “income statements” creating the illusion that films were being made and were returning profits. This was untrue.  
        
        
       In late 1991 or early 1992 the Australian Securities Commission (“ASC”) was investigating the enterprise. The appellant gave instructions to his office manager to remove company records to a storage centre, in order to ensure that they would not be found by the ASC investigators.  
        
        
       1 With respect to charges brought under s 173 of the  
       Crimes Act  
       1900 (NSW), that as director of officer of a company, he fraudulently applied property to his own use, or for a purpose other than that of the body corporate, the appellant, relying on  
       R v Roffell 
        [1985] VR 511, argued that, as the relevant company was entirely under his control, any application of funds, no matter how unlawful or dishonest, represented a consensual transaction and could not found a conviction under the section. 
        
        
       HELD 
       : (per Mason P, Simpson J and Newman AJ concurring), disapproving  
       Roffell 
       : 
        
        
       (i) If  
       Roffell  
       is to continue to be followed, it should be confined strictly to its particular statutory context, ie involving the interpretation of the word “appropriation” in a statutory definition of theft; 
        
       (ii) being in dominant control of a company provides no defence to a director proven to have fraudulently “applied” company cheques for his or her own purposes:  
       R v Glenister 
        [1980] 2 NSWLR 597; Attorney-General’s Reference No.1 of 1985 (1985) 19 A Crim R 436. 
        
        
       2 All charges were prosecuted by the Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) (“CDPP”). By counts 5-13 it was alleged that the appellant was knowingly concerned in various offences by Trainex or Starlight. Each of these counts (except count 11) depended upon s 5 of the  
       Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). 
        The appellant argued that the counts did not disclose any offence known to law, that the CDPP lacked authority to prosecute the charges, and the District Court of NSW lacked jurisdiction to try them. 
        
        
       HELD 
       : (per Mason P, Simpson J and Newman AJ concurring): 
        
        
       (i) The relevant legislation of NSW, by reference, incorporates s 5 of the  
       Crimes Act 1914 (Cth): Corporations (NSW) Act 
        1990,

         [2000] SASC 258; 77 SASR 490; 
         
        
       (ii) The District Court of NSW had jurisdiction to try the charges:  
       Corporations (NSW) Act  
        1990, s 55; 
        
       (iii) The CDPP had the necessary authority to prosecute all charges ( 
       R v Hughes  
       [2000] HCA; 171 ALR 155 
       . 
        
        
       4 Counts 12 and 13 were charges of offences against s 780 of the  
       Corporations Law,  
       which prescribes a maximum penalty of fifty penalty units and/or imprisonment for one year.  
        
        
       HELD 
       : (per Mason P, Simpson J and Newman AJ concurring): 
        
        
       These were summary offences. The District Court lacked jurisdiction to try these charges. The convictions must be quashed. 
        
        
       3. Further  
       HELD 
       : (per Simpson J (Mason P and Newman AJ concurring): 
        
        
       (i) In the circumstances of the case, and in the context of charges incorporating a specific element of dishonesty, the directions given on the appellant’s asserted “claim of right” were adequate; 
        
       (ii) directions given by the trial judge in relation to the meaning of “dishonesty”, “fraudulent”, and “consciousness of guilt” were adequate.

        REGINA v Robert James MACLEOD 
        
       
      
      
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1    MASON P: I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of Simpson J which sets out the facts. I agree with her Honour’s reasons in rejecting the grounds of appeal which she addresses. 
      
       
        
       Ground 2 (no evidence of offences charged in counts 14, 16, 18, 20 and 22) 
        
       
     2    Counts 14, 16 and 18 of the indictment charged the appellant with breaches of s173 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). That section provides: 
      
       
        
         
         Whosoever, being a director, officer, or member, of any body corporate, or public company, 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           fraudulently takes, or applies, for his or her own use or benefit, or any use of purpose other than the use or purpose of such body corporate, or company or fraudulently destroys any of the property of such body corporate, or company  
           
          
         
        
        
         
         shall be liable to imprisonment for 10 years. 
         
        
        
       
     3    Each count charged that between various dates in 1991 at Sydney, being a director of Trainex, the appellant: 
      
       
        
         
         fraudulently applied for his own use property owned by Trainex 
         , 
         
        
        
       being three substantial sums of money owed to Trainex by Chase AMP Bank.  
        
       
     4    The Crown case was that the appellant effectively misappropriated the proceeds of three cheques drawn upon the bank account of Trainex at the bank when he used moneys totalling $954,872.05 as payment for a Gold Coast property which he was purchasing. The property of Trainex thus misappropriated was the money standing to its credit at the bank. 
      
       
     5    Counts 20 and 22 also alleged contravention of s173. They differed from the earlier counts in that they charged that the appellant: 
      
       
        
         
         fraudulently applied for a purpose other than for the purposes of Trainex property owned by Trainex. 
         
        
        
       
     6    The property in question were the proceeds of two further cheques drawn on the Trainex account at the bank. These were applied at the appellant's direction in payment of his loan account with Starlight Film Studios Limited, another company controlled by him. 
      
       
     7    The appellant was convicted on each of the five counts. Ground 2 contends that there was no evidence of the five offences charged. 
      
       
     8    The submission is based upon the appellant embracing as common ground the proposition advanced at trial by the Crown that Trainex was a company entirely under his control. The other directors (if there were any) played no part in its affairs, leaving it to the appellant to run it as if it was his own. The appellant says that he was the directing mind of the company in the sense discussed in Tesco Ltd v Nattrass [1972] AC 153 esp at 170. 
      
       
     9    Invoking R v Roffel [1985] VR 511, the appellant submits that, no matter how dishonestly or unlawfully he acted in causing company property to be transferred to himself, there was nevertheless a consensual transaction which precludes conviction under s173. The appellant says that he was the de facto controller of Trainex and that there was, accordingly, no evidence to suggest that the company (through him) did not intend him to have the moneys which he applied for his personal use. The fact that the payment may have been ultra vires or in breach of fiduciary duty is said to be irrelevant to the present issue. 
      
       
     10    Roffel involved a charge of theft under s72 of the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic). That section provides: 
      
       
        
         
         Basic definition of theft 
         
        
        
         
         1. A person steals if he dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it. 
         
        
        
         
         2. A person who steals is guilty of theft; and 'thief' shall be construed accordingly 
         .  
         
        
        
         
        
       
     11    Roffel and his wife were the sole shareholders and directors of a small company, Roffel being managing director and secretary. He drew cheques on the company's account and used the proceeds for his own purposes. Notwithstanding evidence of intent to defraud creditors, his conviction for theft was set aside by the majority of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria (Young CJ and Crockett J, Brooking J dissenting). The majority held that the element of appropriation required proof that there had been an adverse interference with or usurpation of some right or rights of the owner. As the company was a separate legal entity, and in the particular circumstances (through its directing mind and will) had consented to Roffel drawing cheques on its account, it could not be said that Roffel had interfered with or usurped any of its rights of ownership. 
      
       
     12    The reasoning of the majority turns upon the meaning of ""appropriation"" in the Victorian statute and the application of the obiter reasoning of Lord Roskill in R v Morris [1984] AC 320 esp at 332. Young CJ said (at 513) that it was difficult to imagine that parliament intended to treat as an appropriation the taking of property from a person if the taking was done with the full concurrence of the original owner. Crockett J's reasoning was to similar effect. He held that the transaction in question remained consensual and that it was irrelevant that it may have been void or voidable according to the precepts of company law. 
      
       
     13    There is a powerful dissent by Brooking J which I, like many others, find compelling. Professor Baxt has written that the decision created a good deal of concern and ""disbelief"" by lawyers and commentators ((1993) 67 ALJ 696).) In Fisse, Howard's Criminal Law 5th ed p289-90 it is pointed out that a controller who milks company funds entirely for personal consumption does not represent the directing mind and will of the company but acts in his own capacity. The House of Lords has formally disapproved of the decision in Roffel and persuasively criticised the reasoning in the English decisions upon which the Supreme Court of Victoria relied, including Morris (see R v Gomez [1993] AC 442).  
      
       
     14    In Gomez Lord Keith of Kinkel said (at 464) that the actual decision in Morris (a case involving label switching in a supermarket) was correct, but: 
      
       
        
         
         …  
         it was erroneous, in addition to being unnecessary for the decision, to indicate that an act, expressly or impliedly authorised by the owner could never amount to an appropriation. 
         
        
        
       
     15    Specifically addressing the company fraud cases, Lord Browne-Wilkinson said (at 496-7): 
      
       
        
         
         Turning to the company cases, the dictum in  
         Reg v Morris 
          [1984] AC 320 has led to much confusion and complication where those in de facto control of the company have been charged with theft from it. The argument which has found favour in certain of the authorities runs as follows. There can be no theft within section 1 if the owner consents to what is done:  
         Reg v Morris 
         . If the accused, by reason of being the controlling shareholder or otherwise, is ""the directing mind and will of the company"" he is to be treated as having validly consented on behalf of the company to his own appropriation of the company's property. This is apparently so whether or not there has been compliance with the formal requirements of company law applicable to dealings with the property of a company and even to cases where the consent relied on is ultra vires: see  
         Reg v Roffel 
          [1985] VR 511 and  
         Reg v McHugh 
          (1988) 88 Cr App R 385. 
         
        
        
         
         In my judgment this approach was wrong in law even if the dictum in  
         Morris 
          had been correct. Where a company is accused of a crime the acts and intentions of those who are the directing minds and will of the company are to be attributed to the company. That is not the law where the charge is that those who are the directing minds and will have themselves committed a crime against the company: see  
         Attorney-General's Reference (No 2 of 1982) 
          [1984] QB 624 applying  
         Belmont Finance Corporation Ltd v Williams Furniture Ltd 
          [1979] Ch 250. 
         
        
        
         
         In any event, your Lordships' decision in this case, re-establishing as it does the decision in  
         Reg v Lawrence 
          [1972] AC 626, renders the whole question of consent by the company irrelevant. Whether or not those controlling the company consented or purported to consent to the abstraction of the company's property by the accused, he will have appropriated the property of the company. The question will be whether the other necessary elements are present, viz was such appropriation dishonest and was it done with the intention of permanently depriving the company of such property? In my judgment the decision in  
         Reg v Roffel 
          [1985] VR 511 and the statements of principle in  
         Reg v McHugh 
          88 Cr App R 385, 393, are not correct in law and should not be followed. 
         
        
        
       
     16    The other Law Lords agreed with this analysis (see per Lord Keith at 464-5, Lord Jauncey at 465, Lord Lowry at 491-2, Lord Slynn at 497). With respect, so do I.  
      
       
     17    See also Maher (1986) 21 A Crim R 316 at 337, Durovic (1994) 71 A Crim R 33 at 154-56, Duke Group Ltd v Pilmer (1998) 144 FLR 1 at 87-88. 
      
       
     18    If, which I doubt, Roffel should continue to be followed, it should be confined strictly to its particular statutory context, ie involving the interpretation of the word ""appropriation"" in a statutory definition of theft.  
      
       
     19    Section 173 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) does not, in its operative terms, use the word ""misappropriate"", upon which the now discredited obiter reasoning in Morris and the majority reasoning in Roffel turns. In the context of provisions like s173 there is clear authority that being in dominant control of a company provides no defence to a director proven to have fraudulently ""applied"" company cheques for his or her own purposes (R v Glenister [1980] 2 NSWLR 597, Attorney-General's Reference No 1 of 1985 (1985) 19 A Crim R 436). Glenister also demonstrates that common law principles concerning larceny have no application to the concept of fraudulently taking or applying company property in s173 of the Crimes Act (see esp at 603, 605, 607). 
      
       
     20    Ground 2 should be rejected. There was evidence to support the charges. 
      
       
        
       Grounds 17-18 (counts 5-13 unknown to law; commonwealth DPP lacked authority to prosecute; district court lacked jurisdiction) 
        
       
     21    Counts 5 to 13 were charges by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP) alleging that the appellant was knowingly concerned in various offences by Trainex (counts 3-8, 11-12) and Starlight Film Studios (counts 9-10, 13). With the exception of count 11 which relates to contravention of the Securities Industry (NSW) Code, each of the charges asserts contravention of the Corporations Law. 
      
       
     22    The appellant submits that these counts did not disclose an offence known to law and that the CDPP did not have authority to prosecute them.  
      
       
     23    It is further submitted that the District Court of New South Wales lacked jurisdiction to try the charges. (It would appear that this challenge to count 11 is misconceived because the appellant accepts that there was a State offence of being knowingly concerned in contravention of the Code during the Code era (Companies and Securities (Interpretation and Miscellaneous Provisions) (NSW) Code, s38) and because the offence is indictable (ibid, s35(2)). 
      
       
     24    Although we have heard no submissions on the matter, consideration of the issues raised in these grounds does not appear to be affected by the recently commenced Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (see s1383(1)(c) thereof). 
      
       
     25    Counts 5 to 8 alleged contravention of s1064(1) of the Corporations Law, read with s1311 thereof. Counts 9 and 10 alleged contravention of s1018(1), read with s1311. Counts 12 and 13 alleged contravention of s780, without express reference to s1311 (apparently an omission, but not the subject of any complaint at trial or on appeal).  
      
       
     26    Section 1311 renders contravention of a provision of the Corporations Law an offence punishable on conviction by penalty. Relevant to the appeal, the other provisions state: 
      
       
        
         
         780. A person must not: 
          
         (a) carry on a securities business; or 
          
         (b) hold out that the person carries on a securities business; unless the person holds a dealers licence or is an exempt dealer. 
         
        
        
         
         1018 (1) a person shall not offer for subscription or purchase, or issue invitations to subscribe for or buy, securities of a Corporation unless: 
          
         (a) a prospectus in relation to the securities has been lodged; 
          
         (b) the prospectus complies with the requirements of this Division; and 
          
         (c) if the prospectus is a registrable prospectus - the prospectus has been registered by the Commission under section 1020A. 
          
          
         1064 (1) A person, other than a public corporation, must not make available, offer for subscription or purchase, or issue an invitation to subscribe for or buy, any prescribed interest. 
          
         
        
       
     27    As indicated, the appellant was charged with having been knowingly concerned in the commission of the identified offences by the corporations named. Hamilton v Whitehead (1988) 166 CLR 121 explains why the appellant could be knowingly concerned in offences of this nature even though he was the managing director of the corporations and his mind was the mind of the corporations. 
      
       
     28    The common law of criminal complicity does not have a category of being knowingly concerned in the commission of an offence. Nor is any such offence created in terms by the Corporations Law. It was common ground in the appeal that counts 5-10 and 12-13 depended upon s5(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) which provides: 
      
       
        
         
         Any person who aids, abets, counsels, or procures, or by act or omission is in any way directly or indirectly knowingly concerned in, or party to, the commission of any offence against any law or the Commonwealth, whether passed before or after the commencement of this Act, shall be deemed to have committed that offence and shall be punishable accordingly. 
          
          
         
        
       
     29    This was the springboard for the appellant's submission that these counts were not known to law because contraventions of the Corporations Law are not offences ""against any law of the Commonwealth"" as that expression is understood in s5 of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) itself. 
      
       
     30    The indictment identifies the offences as offences against the Corporations Law. Section 13(2) of the Corporations (New South Wales) Act 1990 (the CNSW Act) provides that for the purposes of the laws of New South Wales a reference in an instrument to the Corporations Law is to be taken to be a reference to the Corporations Law of New South Wales. The text of that law is set out in s 82 of the Corporations Act 1989 (Cth). As Doyle CJ pointed out in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Vis (Vis) (2000) 77 SASR 490 at 492 in relation to the South Australian counterpart of the CNSW Act: 
      
       
        
         
         The enactment by the South Australian Parliament of provisions found in a section in Commonwealth legislation is the central element in a cooperative legislative scheme intended to create 'a single national Corporations Law applying of its own force throughout Australia' :CSA Act, s 13 (1) . 
         
        
        
       
     31    Part 8 of the CNSW Act (ss 26-39) deals with the national administration and enforcement of the Corporations Law. Part 9 (ss 40-56) deals with the jurisdiction and procedure of courts. 
      
       
     32    Section 26 states that the object of Part 8 is to help ensure that: 
      
       
        
         
         (a) the Corporations Law of New South Wales, and the Corporations Law of each jurisdiction other than New South Wales, are administered and enforced on a national basis, in the same way as if those Laws constituted a single law of the Commonwealth …. 
         
        
        
       
     33    Section 29 provides: 
      
       
        
         
         (1) 
          The Commonwealth laws apply as laws of New South Wales in relation to an offence against the applicable provisions of New South Wales as if those provisions were laws of the Commonwealth and were not laws of New South Wales. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) 
          For the purposes of a law of New South Wales, an offence against the applicable provisions of New South Wales; 
         
        
        
         
         (a) is taken to be an offence against the laws of the Commonwealth, in the same way as if those provisions were laws of the Commonwealth; and 
         
        
        
         
         (b) is taken not to be an offence against the laws of New South Wales. 
         
        
        
         
         (3)  
         Subsection (2) has effect for the purposes of a law of New South Wales except as prescribed by regulations under section 80. 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     34    The definition of ""Commonwealth law"" in s3 of the CNSW Act includes the written laws of Commonwealth and is thus apt to pick up s5 of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). 
      
       
     35    Section 31 of the CNSW Act confers various functions and powers on Commonwealth authorities and it is the source of the power to prosecute invoked in the present case by the CDPP. So far as relevant it provides: 
      
       
        
         
         31(1) A Commonwealth law applying because of section 29 that confers on an officer or authority of the Commonwealth a function or power in relation to an offence against the applicable provisions of the Capital Territory also confers on the officer or authority the same function or power in relation to an offence against the corresponding applicable provision of New South Wales. 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     36    Section 55 of the CNSW Act confers jurisdiction on the several courts of each State with respect to the trial and conviction on indictment of offenders charged with “offences against the Corporations Law of New South Wales”. There is no reason why this provision should be read down to exclude the courts of New South Wales. In any event, jurisdiction in respect of all State indictable offences, with presently irrelevant exceptions, is conferred on the District Court by s11 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). 
      
       
     37    The appellant submits that s5 of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) cannot be applied to an offence against the Corporations Law since the Corporations Law is in truth and constitutional derivation a State Act. It is not a law of the Commonwealth and no State enactment (such as s 29 of the CNSW Act) can deem it to be what it is not. Citing some of the reasoning in R v Hughes (2000) 171 ALR 155, the appellant further submits that s31 of the CNSW Act cannot be invoked by the CDPP in aid of offences that are (a) unknown to the law, alternatively (b) State offences. The Crown's reliance on s55 of the CNSW Act is also said to be misplaced in the particular circumstances. 
      
       
     38    Each of these submissions proceeds on the basis that the necessary invocation of s5 of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) involves the assertion that the offences charged in the counts were in truth and constitutional derivation offences against the law of Commonwealth.  
      
       
     39    The decision and reasoning of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia in Vis shows why this submission must be rejected. Mr Vis was charged in the Magistrates Court of South Australia with being concerned in the management of a corporation without leave of the Court, contrary to s 229 of the Corporations Law (SA). Other defendants were charged with aiding, abetting, counselling and procuring the offence, contrary to s5 of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). The charges against the other defendants were dismissed by the magistrate on the basis that s5 could not be used where the commission of the offence was against the law of a State. (This, in essence, is the point now taken by the appellant.)  
      
       
     40    The magistrate’s decision was overturned in the Full Court. That Court held that the effect of s29(2) of the Corporations (SA) Act 1990 was that the reference in s5 to procuring an offence against a law of the Commonwealth is to be read as procuring an offence against the Corporations Law. In other words, State law incorporated the federal enactment by reference, thereby treating the incorporated provision (s5) as part of the enacted State law. Doyle CJ said (at 508-9): 
      
       
        
         
         Section 29(1) of the CSA Act applies s5 of the Crimes Act as a law of South Australia. It applies that provision in relation to an offence against the Corporations Law. 
         
        
        
         
         Turning to s5, one finds that it refers to persons who aid, abet, counsel or procure the commission of an offence against any law of the Commonwealth. It is one thing to apply s5 as a law of South Australia. But how is it to be so applied, bearing in mind that it refers to procuring (I use that term alone for convenience) an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, and Mr Vis was charged with an offence against the law of South Australia? 
         
        
        
         
         The first answer may lie in s29(1) itself. Section 5 of the Crimes Act is applied in relation to the offence against the Corporations Law “as if” the offence provision were a law of the Commonwealth and not a law of South Australia. That is a basis for reading the reference in s5 to procuring an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, to procuring an offence against a law of the State which is to be treated “as if” it were a law of the Commonwealth. 
         
        
        
         
         A second answer, and one about which I am more confident, is found in s29(2) of the CSA Act. The effect of that provision is that for the purposes of South Australian law, the offence charged against Mr Vis “is taken to be an offence against the laws of the Commonwealth” and not to be “an offence against the laws of South Australia”. As applied, s5 is a law of South Australia. Accordingly, for its purposes, the offence charged is taken to be an offence against the laws of the Commonwealth. Thus, the reference in s5 to procuring an offence against a law of the Commonwealth is to be read as procuring an offence against the Corporations Law. 
         
        
        
         
         …what [s29(1)] does is, in a sense, change the language of applied provisions, so that when they are applied as laws of the State, they will operate on laws of the State. Section 29(2) does this by, in effect, directing the reader to treat offences against the laws of South Australia as if they were offences against the laws of the Commonwealth, when one is applying Commonwealth law as the law of South Australia. 
         
        
        
         
         As I understand it, this is what the High Court was saying in  
         Hughes 
          (at 807-808 [22]-[25]). 
         
        
        
       
     41    I respectfully agree. There is no reason why the legislation of one polity may not incorporate by reference the enacted law of another polity (Brown v Green (1951) 84 CLR 285, Western Australia v The Commonwealth (1995) 813 CLR 373 at 484-5). 
      
       
     42    A related submission contended that the language of s5 effectively precluded such incorporation by reference, because of the concluding words “shall be deemed to have committed that offence and shall be punishable accordingly”. The principles of restrictive interpretation of penal provisions stated in The King v Adams (1935) 53 CLR 563 at 566-8 were invoked. Once again, this submission misunderstands the impact of s29 of the CNSW Act. And once again the submission runs into the authority of Vis. There is nothing in the nature of the substantive offences under ss780, 1018 and 1064 of the Corporations Law that make them incapable of being made the subject of an accessorial offence based on an allegation of being knowingly concerned in the offence (see Hamilton v Whitehead. Contrast the offences discussed in Mallan v Lee (1949) 80 CLR 198 at 210, 216). 
      
       
     43    Once it is seen that the offences charged are and remain State offences then any issue about the jurisdiction of the District Court also falls away. 
      
       
     44    But this opens up a different problem, so the appellant contends. He asks: Where is the authority of the Commonwealth Director of Prosecutions to prosecute such offences? In Byrnes v The Queen (1999) 199 CLR 1 the High Court held that s91(5) of the Corporations (South Australia) Act 1990, which (during the Code era) conferred the “enforcement power” of prosecuting at trial level upon the CDPP was not expressed broadly enough to permit the CDPP to institute an appeal in relation to what remained State offences. This involved a question of interpreting the lastmentioned State enactment. Later cases have emphasised that the task is one of statutory construction (Australian Securities Commission v McLeod (2000) 22 WAR 255, Vis). 
      
       
     45    In the present case authority to prosecute is clearly conferred on the CDPP by s31 of the CNSW Act set out above (see Hughes at [28]). 
      
       
     46    The appellant then takes a constitutional point that embraces the matters found against him in the foregoing analysis. He submits that s31 of the CNSW Act did not validly empower the CDPP to prosecute the instant offences. This submission involved consideration of Hughes. There the High Court held that the CDPP had received a valid conferral of power to prosecute, stemming from ss28-29, 31-33 of the Corporations (Western Australia) Act 1990 (WA), which is the counterpart of the CNSW Act. Section 47 of the Corporations Act 1989 (Cth), read together with reg 3(1) of the Corporations (Commonwealth Authorities and Officers) Regulations purported to confer authority on the CDPP to prosecute offences under the Corporations Law.  
      
       
     47    In Hughes the High Court considered a challenge to the authority of the CDPP to prosecute State offences arising under the Corporations Law. The general issue is discussed in the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ at [37]-[46] and in the judgment of Kirby J at [110]-[120]. The ultimate decision in favour of validity turned upon the conclusion that the subject matter of the particular offences engaged s51(i) and s51(xxix) of the Constitution. The charges in Hughes had been laid under s1064(1) of the Corporations Law, read with s1311(1)(a) of the Law. Since, however, the particular offences related to the making of investments in the United States the federal legislative powers in relation to trade and commerce with other countries and matters territorially outside Australia were engaged (see Hughes at [42], [115]. See also R v O’Halloran [2000] NSWCA 528). 
      
       
     48    No constitutional point was raised in the present trial. Had it been, then it is possible that greater attention would have been taken to lay the factual groundwork for resisting the present challenge. Evidence tendered in the appeal by the Crown (the affidavit of Mr Scadden) showed that the impugned dealings with potential investors clearly involved communications across state borders, thus engaging the trade and commerce power. The appellant objected to this tender on the basis that it was not open to the prosecution to repair an evidentiary deficit by tendering fresh evidence on appeal. 
      
       
     49    The jurisprudential nature of the evidentiary problem is not without its difficulties. The Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983 (Cth) (the CDPP Act) ""in a sense is supported by as many heads of power as from time to time have been exercised by the parliament to create offences against Commonwealth laws"" (Hughes at 40 per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ). Constitutional principles are therefore involved and it is not unknown for facts referable to constitutional issues to be tendered on appeal. But those issues impact upon an ostensibly general power to prosecute conferred by federal law. If no federal constitutional power is actually engaged in a particular prosecution the consequence is that the CDPP lacked federal authority to engage in the activity of prosecuting the appellant. But is proof of such authority a requirement of the State law engaged when the CDPP presented the indictment? Does some presumption of validity or regularity apply for the purpose of the prosecution (cf Cassell v The Queen (2000) 201 CLR 189, Hughes at [110]) or is proof of an unchallenged authority an aspect of proof of an essential element of the offences charged which were committed to the jury (cf Cassell at 209 per Kirby J)? Is there an ultimate presumption in favour of constitutional validity (cf The Commonwealth v Tasmania (1983) 158 CLR 1 at 161-8 (Murphy J), Re Turner (1996) 136 ALR 229 at 231 (Kirby J)? 
      
       
     50    At the end of the day I see no need to pursue these interesting questions. Among the evidence tendered in the prosecution was ample material adventitiously available to rebuff this belated point. The prominently advertised subject matter of the interests offered to potential investors was ""sale of copyright"" (AB 1822ff). Investor enquiries were handled by telephone and brochures and correspondence were ""sent out"" (by post, I would infer) to investors and investor advisers. These considerations are sufficient to engage s51(xviii) and (v) respectively of the Constitution in the particular case. 
      
       
     51    In all probability they also engage s51(xx) because the charged activities of the appellant related to primary activities of the companies which he controlled (Trainex and Starlight Film Studios) and those activities branded them with the badges of trading or financial corporations (cf Hughes at [41], O'Halloran). 
      
       
     52    These matters expose a different jurisdictional problem that touches counts 12 and 13, and it is one which the CDPP concedes. It is a problem that no one considered at trial. The offences charged in counts 12 and 13 were offences against s780 of the Corporations Law. The maximum penalty on each counts was 50 penalty units or imprisonment for 1 year, or both (s1311(3) and Schedule 3). This rendered the offences summary offences (Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), s4H as picked up by s29(1) of the CNSW Act: see Vis at 508-9).  
      
       
     53    It follows that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to try the charges in counts 12 and 13, since they involved summary offences. The convictions on those charges must be quashed. This quashing should not and does not affect the sentences imposed severally in relation to the remaining counts on which the appellant was convicted, those sentences being appropriate in their own right. 
      
       
     54    SIMPSON J: On 15 February 1999 the appellant was charged on an indictment containing twenty-five counts, six of which were charged as alternatives to six primary charges. He entered pleas of not guilty to each charge. A jury was empanelled and a trial proceeded. On 10 March 1999 the jury returned verdicts of not guilty on two charges and guilty on nineteen charges. Having found the appellant guilty on five of the six primary charges to which an alternative was laid, it was unnecessary for the jury to determine the alternative counts to those charges. 
      
       
     55    The appellant was sentenced on 4 February 2000 to terms of imprisonment which will be detailed below. He now appeals against each conviction and seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentences. 
      
       
     56    The charges arose out of an enterprise conducted by the appellant over a period which began in 1989 and ended in about 1994. By reason of limitation provisions in the relevant legislation the charges themselves are limited to events that occurred on or after 5 May 1990. The appellant’s activities in the earlier period, however, are relevant to establish the nature of the enterprise and the appellant’s state of mind in the later period. 
      
       
     57    The enterprise in which the appellant was engaged was designed to take advantage of taxation concessions offered by Division 10B of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The appellant was a director of three companies - Trainex Pty Limited (“Trainex”), Starlight Film Studios Limited (“Starlight”) and Communications Entertainment Network Limited (“CEN”). Through these companies, on the Crown case, the appellant offered investment opportunities on the basis that copyright in certain primary material would be acquired and films made. Investors would, in effect, have an entitlement to participate in any profits made by the films. It will be necessary to elaborate upon some aspects of the arrangements when the specific charges and individual grounds of appeal are considered. For present purposes the foregoing is a sufficient account.  
      
       
     58    More than $6,000,000 was invested in various amounts, by several thousand investors. Of this sum, approximately $718,000 was used to make films. More than $2,000,000 was applied, in a variety of ways, to the appellant’s own benefit. The largest of these amounts was $955,000 which he used to purchase a home unit in Queensland in his own name. Other amounts were paid to the credit of a loan account in Starlight in the appellant’s name on which he subsequently drew.

       A “prescribed interest” is defined in s 5 to include a “participation interest” which is, in turn, defined as:  
        
        
         
         “… any right to participate, or any interest -

         is, unless that provision or another provision of this Code provides that he is guilty of an offence, guilty of an offence by virtue of this sub-section.

         Penalty: $5,000 or imprisonment for 1 year, or both.

         (b) does not do an act or thing that the person is required or directed to do by or under a provision of this Law; or 
         
        
        
         
         (c) otherwise contravenes a provision of this Law; 
         
        
        
         
         is guilty of an offence by virtue of this subsection, unless that or another provision of this Law provides that the person:

       The charges 
        
        
       Counts 1 - 4: 
        
       
     60    The counts numbered 1 - 4 on the indictment were expressed to be laid under ss 169 and 570(1) of the Companies (NSW) Code. Each alleged that, between 5 May 1990 and 31 December 1990, the appellant was knowingly concerned in the commission of an offence against those sections by Trainex. The offence said to have been committed by Trainex was, in each case, offering a prescribed interest to the public for subscription or purchase, in contravention of the two sections. Each charge concerned an alleged offer in relation to a different film.  
      
       
        
        
        
       Counts 5 - 8: 
        
       
     61    The counts numbered 5 - 8 were expressed to be laid under ss 1064(1) and 1311(1)(a) of the Corporations Law. Each alleged that, between 1 January 1991 and 30 June 1991, the appellant was knowingly concerned in the commission by Trainex of an offence against those sections. The offence said to have been committed by Trainex was, while not a public corporation, offering a prescribed right for subscription or purchase. Each of these charges also concerned an alleged offer in relation to a different film.  
      
       
        
       Counts 9 - 10: 
        
       
     62    By counts 9 and 10 it was alleged that the appellant was, between 1 July 1991 and 30 June 1992, knowingly concerned in the commission of offences by Starlight against ss1018(1) and 1311(1) of the Corporations Law. The offences it was alleged Starlight had committed were offering prescribed interests for subscription or purchase, no prospectus having been registered with the Australian Securities Commission. 
      
       
        
       Count 11: 
        
       
     63    Count 11 was a charge brought under s 43 of the Securities Industry (NSW) Code. It alleged that, between 5 May 1990 and 31 December 1990, the appellant was knowingly concerned in the commission of an offence by Trainex against that section. It alleged that, between those dates, Trainex carried on a business of dealing with securities while not the holder of a dealer’s licence, and not being a recognised dealer or an exempt dealer.  
      
       
        
       Counts 12 - 13: 
        
       
     64    In counts 12 and 13 it was alleged that the appellant, between 1 January 1991 and 30 June 1991 (count 12) and between 1 July 1991 and 30 June 1992 (Count 13) the appellant was knowingly concerned in the commission of offences by Trainex and Starlight respectively against s 780 of the Corporations Law. The offence it was alleged each company had committed was carrying on a securities business without holding a dealer’s licence or being an exempt dealer.  
      
       
        
       Counts 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24: 
        
       
     65    These counts were laid under s 173 of the Crimes Act 1900. Each alleged that, between different specified dates in 1991, the appellant as a director (counts 14, 16, 18 and 24) or officer (counts 20, 22) of a body corporate, fraudulently applied for his own use (counts 14,16 and 18), or for purposes other than those of Trainex (counts 20 and 22), property owned by Trainex or (in the case of count 24) CEN. 
      
       
        
       Counts 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25: 
        
       
     66    These counts were charged respectively as alternatives to counts 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 and 24. In each case it was alleged that, between the stated dates, the appellant as an officer of a corporation made improper use of his position to gain advantage for himself by causing the payment of money to himself or on his behalf. These counts relied upon s 232(6) of the Corporations Law. 
      
       
     67    It will be observed that proof of counts 1 - 13 depended upon proof, inter alia, of an essential element: that the appellant was knowingly concerned in the offences it was alleged that the relevant company had committed; and that proof of counts 1 - 10 depended also upon proof, inter alia, that the conduct alleged involved “a prescribed interest” as defined in the relevant legislation. 
      
       
     68    The trial commenced on 15 February 1999. The appellant was then represented by counsel. He continued to be so represented throughout the entirety of the Crown case, and, initially, during the defence case, in which he gave sworn evidence. On 2 March, while under cross-examination, he terminated his instructions to his legal representatives, and for the remainder of the trial appeared unrepresented. In these circumstances, in my view, Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules should not preclude consideration of any grounds of appeal raised. 
      
       
     69    The jury convicted on counts 1 - 14, 16, 18, 20 and 22. Having convicted on counts 14, 16, 18, 20 and 22, it returned no verdict on the alternatives to those counts (15, 17, 19, 21 and 23). The jury acquitted on both count 24 and its alternative, count 25.  
      
       
        
       Sentences 
        
       
     70    On 4 February 2000 Judge Rummery sentenced the appellant. The sentences were as follows: 
      
       
        
       (i) Counts 1 - 4: penal servitude for a fixed term of three years and one month commencing 30 January 1997

       The Crown case 
        
       
     71    Put shortly, the Crown case was that the entire enterprise was a sham. The nature of the enterprise, as the Crown presented it, may be illustrated by reference to one project. This concerns a proposed film series called Toddler Taming, which was to be based upon a book of the same name by Dr Christopher Green. In March 1988, after some months of negotiations, Dr Green and his wife assigned all film, television and video rights in Toddler Taming to Trainex. The agreement was contained in a document entitled Film Rights Agreement which was executed on 21 March 1998. The agreement named Dr Green and his wife as “the authors”, and Trainex, trading as Trainex Film Productions, as the purchaser. It was signed by the appellant on behalf of Trainex. The agreement became Ex 7. As the title of the agreement suggests, it gave Trainex the right to do what was necessary for, or associated with, the making of a film based upon Dr Green’s book. Dr and Mrs Green were to receive a sum of $5,000 and, thereafter, 5 percent of the wholesale selling price received by Trainex for the sale of the film when made. 
      
       
     72    Subsequently the appellant gave Dr Green documentation relating to investment in the proposed film, with the suggestion that he might consider investing in the project. This same documentation was sent to others targeted as potential investors in that film.  
      
       
     73    The documentation included a one page document giving some information about “Trainex Film Productions”, and an invitation for applications for investment in a series of films to be made of Toddler Taming. Included in this, under the heading “Investment Interest” was the following: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         HOW TO INVEST 
           
         
        
        
         
         Persons seeking to invest in the film should contact either their accountant who supplied this offer document, or Mr Robert McLeod on 922 2888 or write to P.O. Box 1633, North Sydney, 2060.” (AB 1337) 
         
        
       
     74    An “Investor’s Deed” was executed by Trainex and each person who invested in the film  Toddler Taming. Some provisions of the Deed may here be noted. The essential provision was that each investor agreed to invest a specified amount in the film to be called Toddler Taming, which was to be completed by no later than 30 December 1990. Copyright in the film was to be owned as to 50 percent by Trainex and as to the remaining 50 percent by investors in proportion to their investments. By clause 2.2 Trainex was to deposit the invested funds into a Trust Account; by clause 2.3 Trainex was permitted to invest the funds in any interest bearing or discounted securities authorised by the Trustee Act 1925. On satisfaction of defined subscription conditions (essentially the raising of sufficient funds to meet the budgeted cost of making the film) Trainex was obliged, by clause 5, to proceed with the production of the film. A number of additional conditions, unnecessary here to detail, were specified in a series of subclauses to clause 5. 
      
       
     75    By clause 6.1 (a) each investor was to be one of the first owners of the copyright in the film. (This was essential if the projected taxation benefits of Part 111, Division 10 BA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 were to be achieved.) The Deed contained a further acknowledgment (clause 8.1) that from the completion date (as defined) the copyright in the film would be owned by investors and Trainex in the proportions already mentioned. 
      
       
     76    The parties to the Deed agreed that, subject to presently irrelevant exceptions, Trainex or its agent would hold on behalf of the investors all rights necessary to make and market the film (clause 6.1 (b)). Clause 10 provided for the disbursement of the net proceeds of the film. Investors were entitled to a return of the amount invested, and, after repayment of any funds advanced for the completion of the film by non-investors, a proportionate share in any additional proceeds. 
      
       
     77    Various investment options were offered. By far the most popular among these was that identified as “Option C” which allowed the investor to elect to contribute, in actual funds, only 30 percent of the nominal investment amount. The remaining 70 percent was, according to the documentation, to be “subsidised” by Trainex. The investor, having contributed only 30 percent, would, however, (again according to the documentation) be entitled to an income tax concession in relation to 100 percent of the nominal investment. In reality, the 70 percent “subsidy” was never paid, and appeared only as an entry in the books of account. 
      
       
     78    From time to time after entering the agreement investors were sent letters containing “investment details”, also referred to as “income statements”. One such statement, again taken by way of illustration, was sent in 1989 to a person who had invested in Toddler Taming. The letter contained the assertion: 
      
       
        
         
         “There is a requirement that a concession claimed in relation to a film under 10B of  
         Tax Act 
          should be income producing in the year in which the concession (or deduction) is claimed. The above film has met that requirement.” (AB 1804) 
         
        
       
     79    The investor was advised to declare, for taxation purposes: 
      
       
        
         
         “The film has become income producing and the amount credited to my account is $195.65.” (AB 1804) 
         
        
        
       The investor was told that further statements would be sent quarterly. 
        
       
     80    Subsequent income statements, in a slightly different form, attributed income to “video sales - initial order”, or “video sales - second order” and later orders. Investors were able to elect whether to receive the relatively small amounts of income or to have them reinvested.  
      
       
     81    These statements created the illusion that a film had been made, that marketing had begun, and that income was being generated. The truth was that ten videos constituting the Toddler Taming series were taped between August and December 1990, after considerable agitation by Dr Green. There was, in fact, no income from film production. The appearance of such income was created by allocating fresh investment funds to that purpose. 
      
       
     82    In November 1989 a cheque in the amount of $300,000 was drawn on Trainex’s business account. It was paid into the trust account of a firm of solicitors representing the vendor of a property purchased in the appellant’s name. 
      
       
     83    Over a period substantial sums were paid from Trainex’s accounts and credited to the appellant’s loan accounts, from which the appellant drew from time to time. In 1991, cheques totalling $955,000 were drawn on Trainex’s accounts and applied to the purchase of a home unit on the Gold Coast in the appellant’s name.  
      
       
     84    In late 1991 or early 1992 the Australian Securities Commission (“the ASC” was investigating the enterprise. The appellant directed David Staume, Trainex’s account manager and office manager, to remove company records to a storage centre in Ultimo. His stated purpose was to ensure that they would not be found by the ASC.  
      
       
        
       The defence case 
        
       
     85    The appellant gave evidence. In short, the position he maintained was that the transaction between Trainex (later Starlight) and the investors was not a transaction conferring upon investors rights to participate, or any interest, in the profits of the films, but was a sale to the investors of the copyright, not in the films when made, but in the screenplays upon which the films were to be based, or in the scripts for the films. If that were so, the investors would not have a “prescribed interest”, a necessary element in counts 1 - 10. 
      
       
     86    The appellant claimed that the 70 percent subsidy was a gift to the investors, and that an equivalent interest of the same value on the film project was also a gift by him to the investors. (AB526) 
      
       
     87    He explained the payments of sums of money to himself or on his behalf as being either loans or by way of payment for his services to the company. He asserted that Trainex owed him more money than he owed it. He claimed to have directed David Staume, the company’s account and office manager, to record all such payments as loans. 
      
       
        
       The Appeal against Conviction 
        
       
     88    In all, 18 grounds of appeal were pleaded. Some overlap, and may be disposed of jointly. No submissions were addressed to the ground numbered 1, and it is not necessary to record it. In relation to the grounds numbered 2, 17 and 18, I have read in draft, and agree with, the judgment of Mason P. 
      
       
        
       Grounds 3, 4, 8 and 10 
        
       
     89    These grounds were pleaded as follows: 
      
       
        3. The evidence in respect of counts 14, 16, 18, 20 and 22 did not constitute the offences charged. 
        
         
         4. (a) His Honour erred in law in not directing a verdict of acquittal in respect of all the above counts; 
         
        
        (b) alternatively there was a miscarriage of justice in that the verdicts were unsafe and unsatisfactory and/or against the evidence and the weight of the evidence. 
        
        8. His Honour erred in law in misdirecting and/or not directing as to ‘fraudulently’ in counts 14, 16, 18, 20, 22. 
        
        10. His Honour misdirected and/or failed to direct the jury as to the elements of the offences of fraud in counts 14, 16, 18, 20 and 22. 
        
       
     90    I take Ground 3 to be a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to establish proof of the criminal conduct alleged. 
      
       
     91    As I perceive it, Ground 4 raises essentially the same matters as Ground 3. All these grounds can conveniently be dealt with together. 
      
       
     92    The counts to which these grounds are directed, brought under s 173 of the Crimes Act 1900, are charges that the appellant as a director (counts 14, 16 and 18) or officer (counts 20 and 22) fraudulently applied property of the body corporate to his own use (counts 14, 16 and 18) or for a purpose other than that of the body corporate (counts 20 and 22). Fraudulent intent is an ingredient in each offence. It was in relation to this ingredient that the appellant contended the evidence was deficient. 
      
       
     93    In his written submissions counsel for the appellant focused not only upon the asserted insufficiency of evidence to prove fraudulence, but also criticised the directions given by the trial judge. 
      
       
     94    In R v Glenister [1980] 2 NSWLR 597 this court equated the fraudulent intent element of a charge under s 173 with dishonesty (p 607). It is necessary for the Crown to establish that the dishonesty existed at the time of the relevant transaction: Peters v R (1998) 192 CLR 493; R v Lawson (1996) 86 A Crim R 111. 
      
       
     95    There was in this case ample evidence on which the jury could conclude that the appellant, at the relevant times, acted dishonestly. This evidence included evidence of the disposal of the investors’ funds: of more than $6 million invested, approximately $2.2 million was used for the appellant’s own purposes. He in fact made formal admissions, pursuant to s 184 of the Evidence Act 1995, to that effect. A very small proportion of the funds ($718,000) was used in producing films. The income statement sent to investors falsely represented that income had been derived. The “income” they showed was in fact funds derived from subsequent investors, and not from the marketing of completed film. The so-called subsidy of 70 percent offered to investors was similarly a misrepresentation of the true position. The instruction given by the appellant to David Staume to conceal records from the ASC was evidence the jury were entitled to use as evidence of dishonesty. 
      
       
     96    There is no substance in the submission that the prosecution evidence was insufficient to support a finding of dishonesty. 
      
       
     97    The criticism of the directions given to the jury was two-fold. First, it was submitted that the directions failed to bring home to the jury the need for the Crown to show that a dishonest intent existed at the time of the acts (or omissions) constituting the actus reus of the crime; Second, that the trial judge failed to alert the jury to a possible “claim of right” on the part of the appellant.  
      
       
     98    On the first day of the summing-up the judge directed the jury in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “In paragraph 30 [referring to written directions given to the jury] you are told that the fraudulent means dishonest (sic). To act fraudulently is to act dishonestly. In deciding whether the acts of the accused, such acts as you find he did on the evidence that you have, in applying the property of Trainex in the manner you find he did, and there does not seem to be any dispute about where the money went to and for what purpose it went in relation to this unit in the Gold Coast, but in deciding whether such acts of the accused as you find he did in applying the property of Trainex in the manner you find he did was or was not dishonest you as the jury apply the current standards of ordinary decent people.” 
         
        
       
     99    The following day the judge returned to this topic. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I should have said this to you yesterday that the accused’s state of mind may also be relevant to the question of whether or not he acted improperly. For example if he reasonably believed that what he did was genuinely for the benefit of the company that belief may be relevant in determining whether he can be held to be criminally responsible for using his position in the way that he did. 
         
        
        
         
         I might not have made clear to you yesterday that in the accused’s case after counts 1 - 13 is that he was legally entitled to use the company funds in the way that did. Specifically he said that one, he is owed money for his services such as script writing, acting as a producer and an executive producer. Acting as the director of a company and generally managing the company and acquiring copyright. Two, that he directed Mr Storm (sic) to record all money advanced to him as loans and three, that Trainex owed him more money than he owed Trainex. Of course you also recall the Crown address to you and his submissions as to why you should find the accused acted dishonestly. 
         
        
        
         
         I remind you of my directions to you especially in relation to the meaning of fraudulently which is in paragraph 30 of my aide memoir that you have that and in assessing the accused’s case that he was entitled to use the company money as he did you should apply the same principles, that is whether by ordinary notions the accused was acting honestly by the standards of ordinary decent people. Finally I remind you that again the onus remains on the Crown to establish the elements of the charges beyond reasonable doubt.” 
         
        
       
     100    The judge gave written directions which contained the following paragraph: 
      
       
        
         
         “(30)  
         Fraudulent 
          means dishonest. To act fraudulently is to act dishonestly. In deciding whether the acts of the accused in applying the property of Trainex in the manner you find he did was or was not dishonest, you should apply the current standards of ordinary decent people.” 
         
        
       
     101    I am satisfied that these directions were not inadequate in the circumstances. One specific complaint that was made was that the oral direction concerning the appellant’s state of mind used the word “reasonably” where it should have used the word “honestly”, and that, as framed, the direction had the tendency to reverse the onus of proof in such a way as to suggest that it was for the appellant to establish an honest belief rather than for the Crown to negative such a belief.  
      
       
     102    Given that the judge had given the usual directions as to the onus of proof, I see no merit in the argument that the direction reversed the onus of proof. 
      
       
     103    The use of the word “reasonably” could, potentially, be of more significance. However, it was, to my mind, inconsequential in the overall summing-up. The last words spoken to the jury by the judge were the reminder that the onus of proof lay upon the Crown. 
      
       
     104    A further matter raised by the appellant in relation to each of these charges concerned the nature of the “property” the subject of the charge. In each case, the substance of the charge is the fraudulent application of “property”, being the property of the corporation. In each count, the “property” is identified as a sum of money said to have been owed by the Chase AMP Bank to the corporation. 
      
       
     105    In my opinion the submissions made on behalf of the appellant are based upon a misconception both of the indictment and the written directions. In the written submissions it was said that: 
      
       
        
         
         “The property referred to in counts 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 was said to be a cheque in each case (see pp 6 and 8 of Written Directions) …” 
         
        
       
     106    I have already observed that each count in the indictment identified the relevant “property” as a sum of money. No count identified a cheque as the relevant property. Further, in the written directions, under the sub heading “Applied”, the following appears: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Crown case is that the  
         application 
          of property of Trainex was in each case by a cheque drawn upon the bank account of Trainex at the Chase AMP Bank which cheque was presented for payment and paid, the moneys so paid being utilised as payment for the Gold Coast property which the accused purchased. The  
         property 
          of Trainex is the money standing to the credit of Trainex at the bank.” (italics and underlining in original) 
         
        
       
     107    It is quite clear from this direction that the “property” in question was, in each case, a sum of money. This was reinforced by the directions given orally, when his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Now the property on the Crown case which was applied was the money standing to the credit of Trainex at the Chase AMP Bank. For his own use, paragraph 29 the Crown case is that such use of Trainex funds was for the accused’s own use which was contrary to a use or purpose of Trainex.” 
         
        
       
     108    A specific aspect of the argument in relation to these grounds concerned what was said to have been “a claim of right”. 
      
       
     109    In his evidence in chief the appellant said that he regarded the funds as being funds belonging to Trainex, and himself as being the owner of Trainex, and therefore the owner of the money. He said that he had not, in the early years, drawn a salary but, that, when the company’s financial position was more secure, he was entitled to do so. He said that he believed that the company owed him more than the amount that he borrowed from it.  
      
       
     110    Counsel for the appellant relied upon a passage in the decision of the High Court in Peters, in which Toohey and Gaudron JJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         “There may be cases where the evidence is such that, even though the issue is not specifically raised, it is necessary to instruct the jury that they must be satisfied that the accused neither had nor believed that he had a legal right to prejudice or imperil the rights or interests of the victim of the intended fraud. But that is not the case where, as here, the appellant asserted no such right or belief and the assertion of a right or belief that he had a right to prejudice the Commissioner in relation to tax payable by Spong would have been patently absurd.” 
         
        
       
     111    Their Honours held that in the circumstances of that case an instruction that the jury had to be satisfied that the appellant’s conduct was dishonest according to the standards of ordinary, honest people and that he knew it was dishonest by those standards was a direction more favourable than that to which he was entitled.  
      
       
     112    The judge expressly referred to this evidence in the summing-up. Having referred specifically to the evidence given by the appellant, he reminded the jury of the directions in relation to the meaning of “fraudulently” and directed the jury that they should apply the same principles “in assessing the accused(sic) case that he was entitled to use the company money as he did”. 
      
       
     113    In the circumstances, in my view, this was an entirely adequate direction. It is difficult to see how, if the jury found that the appellant had acted dishonestly, they could then find that he acted under a bona fide belief that he was entitled to do as he did. Where dishonesty is a specific element of an offence charged, it is difficult to see that a bona fide claim of right adds anything, or requires anything additional by way of directions. Here, in fact, the jury was specifically reminded of the factual matters the appellant relied on to support the assertion of a claim of right. 
      
       
     114    In my opinion there is no substance to the criticism of the directions given in relation to these counts. I would reject Grounds 3, 4, 8 and 10.  
      
       
        
       Grounds 5 and 9 
        
       
     115    Each of these Grounds is concerned with counts 1 - 13 inclusive, and particularly the concepts of “prescribed interests” and “participation interests” pursuant to the Companies (NSW) Code  and the Corporations Law. By Ground 5 the appellant complains that the case put to the jury by the Crown in its final submissions, and by the trial judge in his summing-up, was at variance from the Crown case in relation to “prescribed interests” as opened to the jury, and that a miscarriage of justice was thereby occasioned. By Ground 9 the appellant complains of the directions of law given in relation to “prescribed interest” and “participation interest”. 
      
       
     116    The salient legislative provisions are the definitions of “prescribed interest” which relevantly includes a participation interest, and of “participation interest”, which, in short, means any right to participate, or any interest in any profits, assets or realisation of any financial or business undertaking or scheme, in any common enterprise, in relation to which the holder of the right or interest is led to expect profits or interest from the efforts of the promoter of the enterprise or a third party, or in any investment contract, whether or not the right or interest is enforceable, whether the right or interest is actual, prospective or contingent, and whether or not the right or interest is evidenced by a formal document, and whether or not the right or interest relates to a physical asset. Certain rights or interests, presently immaterial, are excluded from the definition.  
      
       
     117    The Crown opened its case in this respect by saying: 
      
       
        
         
         “For present purposes a prescribed interest in investment is one in which investors participate in a common enterprise for profit. … In this case the investments the Crown says were prescribed interests because investors paid money for a proportionate share in the copyright of particular films. The ownership of the film copyright gave investors part of an asset of the undertaking of the film, and the ownership of the film copyright also gave investors a right to participate in the income generated by sale or distribution of the film. … 
         
        
        
         
         The Crown says these are prescribed interests because they involve the banding together of numerous investors in a common enterprise from which they are led to expect that they will obtain profits, and that they were made in similar circumstances.” 
         
        
       
     118    It is apparent from this that the Crown did not confine itself to any one of the three sub groups of “participation interest” into which the definition is divided. The opening is broad enough to incorporate any or all of the descriptions there contained.  
      
       
     119    In his closing address the Crown Prosecutor referred to the three aspects of the definition of “prescribed interest”, and put to the jury that the scheme it alleged had been promoted by the appellant comfortably fell within any of the three parts of the definition. In the written directions each of the three parts of the definition was set out. 
      
       
     120    In the oral directions the trial judge referred to the written directions and, in effect, repeated what was there set out. He then told the jury that it was a matter for them to determine as a matter of fact whether the rights given to investors under the contract came within any of the three parts of the definition.  
      
       
     121    I perceive no variation from the Crown opening in what was said in final address by the Crown, or in summing-up or written directions by the judge. Ground 5 should, in my opinion, fail. 
      
       
     122    No separate argument was directed to the complaint about the adequacy of the directions given. In my opinion, they were, as can be seen from the extract set out above, clear and concise and provided the relevant assistance to the jury.  
      
       
     123    I would reject this ground of appeal. 
      
       
        
       Ground 6 
        
       
     124    By Ground 6 the appellant complains that the trial judge failed adequately to put the defence case to the jury and misdirected or failed to direct the jury as to the relevant facts asserted by the Crown and those asserted by the defence in respect of the elements of each offence. 
      
       
     125    In written submissions reference was made to R v Piazza (1997) 94 A Crim R 459 and R v Zorad (1990) 19 NSWLR 91. These cases reinforce the principle that a summing-up should contain directions as to the relevant law, its application to the facts of a particular case, the ingredients of the offence charged, and “a collected resume” of the evidence relevant to each of the ingredients, and a brief outline of the argument put by or on behalf of the parties. 
      
       
     126    The precise criticism that was made was that, in relation, for example, to the directions relating to “prescribed interest”, no reference was made to the relevant parts of the evidence and the jury was left to “forage” through the exhibits and evidence to find the facts supporting the competing positions. 
      
       
     127    Counsel contrasted these directions with those given in relation to fraud, which were more detailed. In respect of the fraud counts the appellant was acquitted. 
      
       
     128    In the summing-up the trial judge referred to evidence given by the appellant and encapsulated the case that he sought to make. He, in effect, summarised this position by saying: 
      
       
        
         
         “Mr McLeod in his evidence made it clear and supported it by what he said in his address was that his motivation was to use a scheme called 10(B) and not 10(B)(A) (sic). He said what these investors so called acquired was a copyright interest, an interest in the copyright, and such an interest is property, that is what they got, that the funds that they contributed were company funds and he controlled the company. The company used its own money, consistent with the policy he had given it.  
         
        
        
         
         He said that he was owed a deal of money by Trainex. He said that he gave instructions to Mr Storm(sic) to deal with moneys by way of loan. He said Trainex owed him far more than he owed it. Specifically in relation to the CEN matters he says of course, … what they were getting there was a copyright in the US company, CEN Inc. He said that he had a copyright in a new ‘Compulsory Heroes’ script, it belonged to him and that he was going to, I think he said license it to CEN Incorporated and the money was not an investment in CEN Limited, that is the Australian company which had only an administrative function.” 
         
        
       
     129    There were more references to the case the appellant sought to make. I do not think the jury could have been in any doubt as to the appellant’s position. On a fair reading of the summing-up there was no failure properly to direct the jury in relation to the relevant factual matters. I would reject Ground 6. 
      
       
     130    A ground numbered 7 was pleaded but, at the hearing of the appeal, was not pressed.  
      
       
        
       Ground 11 
        
       
     131    Ground 11 in the Notice of Grounds of Appeal is expressed as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “His Honour erred in law in misdirecting and/or failing to direct the jury as to the elements of counts 1 - 4.” 
         
        
       
     132    However, in written submissions the complaint that was made concerned what was said to be a defect in the indictment in relation to each of these charges. It is necessary only to set out the terms of the indictment in respect of count 1. It is framed as follows:  
      
       
        
         
         “Between 5 May 1990 and 31 December 1990, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, [the appellant] was knowingly concerned in the commission of an offence against sections 169 and 570(1) of the  
         Companies (NSW) Code  
         by Trainex Pty Limited (“Trainex”), namely an offence that between 5 May 1990 and 31 December 1990 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, Trainex offered to the public for subscription or purchase a prescribed interest, namely rights in respect of copyright in the cinematographic film ‘Toddler Taming’.” 
         
        
        
       Counts 2 to 4 were similarly framed. 
        
       
     133    The commission of an offence against sections 169 and 170(1) by Trainex was a necessary pre-requisite to each charge that the appellant was knowingly concerned in such an offence.  
      
       
     134    Recourse to those sections discloses that proof that Trainex committed the offence required, in turn, proof that Trainex was not a company within the meaning of s 169 of the Companies Code. That required proof that Trainex did not fall within any of the descriptions or definitions of “company” contained in s 164 (1) of the Companies Code.  
      
       
     135    The defect that the appellant asserts can be identified in the indictment is the absence of any averment that Trainex was not a company within the meaning of that section. 
      
       
     136    The averment in the indictment that Trainex had committed an offence against s 169 necessarily implied that Trainex was not a company within the s 164(1) definition. It was not necessary, in my opinion, for that fact to be separately averred. The appellant, who, at the time he was arraigned, was legally represented, could have been in no doubt that that was an element of the charge alleged to have been committed by the company. Proof of that circumstance was given by an investigator of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, (“ASIC”) and was not disputed. If there were a defect in the indictment, and I do not think there was, it was of such a technical nature as to be of no consequence. The fact alleged to have been omitted from the count as framed was, in the trial, proved, and was plainly not an issue. 
      
       
     137    A similar argument was raised in relation to counts 9 and 10, which alleged the appellant was knowingly concerned in the commission of offences by Starlight against ss 1018(1) and 1311(1) of the Corporations Law. In these counts, the Crown alleged that the offence by Starlight was offering “for subscription or purchase securities, namely prescribed interests …” The omission, which the appellant urges is fundamental, is an allegation that the securities were securities of a corporation.  
      
       
     138    For the reasons given in relation to the same argument concerning counts 1 - 4 I am satisfied that there is no substance in this argument. I would reject Ground 11. 
      
       
        
       Ground 12 
        
       
     139    By Ground 12 the appellant complains of directions given as to “consciousness of guilt”.  
      
       
     140    The particular evidence on which the Crown relied as evidence of consciousness of guilt was the evidence that the appellant had instructed Mr Staume to remove and conceal files in order to avoid their discovery by the ASC. The trial judge reminded the jury of this evidence, and the submission that had been put on behalf of the Crown. He then added: 
      
       
        
         
         “You have to remember that people do not always act rationally and conduct of that kind, perhaps can be explained in other ways. It may be a result of panic to hide some other misconduct, which has got nothing to do with the matter before you and you will remember that the accused gave an explanation and I’m looking at the transcript at page 634, this is during cross-examination.” 
         
        
       
     141    His Honour then read out a number of questions and answers. Included was an answer given by the appellant, explaining his action as being: 
      
       
        
         
         “… I believe to preserve what is my property and the property of my company and preserve the records.” 
         
        
       
     142    He then said: 
      
       
        
         
         “… if you accept that as a possible explanation, then you are not able to draw the inference that the Crown asks you to draw in relation to his actions being done because of a consciousness of guilt on his part.” 
         
        
       
     143    In my opinion this was, in the circumstances, an adequate direction. It drew to the jury’s attention the evidence relied on both by the Crown and by the appellant, and properly put in context the approach to be taken in consideration of the evidence. 
      
       
     144    A specific criticism was that the words “If you accept that as a possible explanation” amounted to a reversal of the onus of proof, but I would also reject this criticism. The word “possible” is of considerable importance. The direction was classically correct. 
      
       
     145    Finally, it was argued that the direction failed to specify the charges to which it related, or to state that the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. The first of these arguments must be rejected. The evidence upon which the Crown relied as consciousness of guilt related to the appellant’s conduct generally and was concerned with all of the charges. Nor is there any substance in the second matter raised. The jury were told a number of times about the onus and standard of proof. 
      
       
     146    Finally, it was said that the direction was misconceived because, at the time the documents were removed, no charges had been laid and there was no evidence that the concealment was deliberate, with the charges in mind. This argument misapprehends the nature of “consciousness of guilt” evidence. An offender may well act in such a way as to evidence consciousness of guilt before charges are laid. In this case there was evidence that ASIC had begun its investigations and it was with this in mind that the appellant took the course he did. 
      
       
     147    I would reject Ground 12. 
      
       
        
       Ground 13 
        
       
     148    Ground 13 is framed as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “His Honour erred in law in misdirecting as to: 
         
        
        
       (a) choosing between different versions … 
        
        
         
         (b) who is to be believed? …” 
         
        
       
     149    Once again, the specific complaint made in the written submission is that the directions reversed the onus of proof. 
      
       
     150    The passages in the summing-up of which complaint is made are the following: 
      
       
        
         
         “You can that is to say arrive at a conclusion that any witness or for that matter the accused is accurate on some matters but inaccurate or mistaken in respect of others. … We are I suggest to you in our ordinary lives commonly at times confronted with situations where different people give us different versions of something that has happened and sometimes the situation is where, for one reason or other, we have to choose between those different versions. It is easy to perhaps think of examples of things like that when one is dealing with children … we probably make up our decisions as to what we accept and what we do not accept without exactly spelling out in our minds just how we are doing it or possibly even the fact that we are doing it.” (S/U 13 - 14) 
         
        
        
         
         It may be said and indeed you may well be saying it to yourselves that this case turns upon a conflict between the evidence of the prosecution witnesses and the evidence of the accused. You may ask yourselves who is to be believed, but even if you think the prosecution witnesses are probably telling the truth, that does not conclude the issue whether the prosecution has proved the case against the accused. Even if you prefer the evidence for the prosecution you should not convict the accused unless you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of the evidence, the evidence which you accept is going to establish the elements or ingredients in each of these counts which you have to consider.” (S/U 53) 
         
        
       
     151    There is no merit in the criticism made of these directions. They were properly balanced directions, reminding the jury of the onus and standard of proof. I would reject Ground 13. 
      
       
     152    Grounds numbered 14 and 15 were pleaded but not pressed. I have already recorded my agreement with the conclusions of Mason P in relation to Grounds 17 and 18.  
      
       
        
        
        
       Application for leave to appeal against sentence 
        
       
     153    The appellant was sentenced on 4 February 2000. The sentences have been set out above. In total, he was sentenced to a minimum term of five and a half years’ imprisonment, commencing 30 January 1997, with an additional term of eighteen months. Count 18 was made the vehicle for the bulk of the term. On that count the appellant was sentenced to penal servitude for seven years with a minimum term of five years. The remainder of the effective term was brought about by the imposition of two cumulative fixed terms of six months, imposed in relation to counts 11 and 22. All other sentences were subsumed within that overall term. 
      
       
     154    The appellant was born on 22 November 1954. The offences were committed over a period beginning in May 1990 and ending in June 1992, when the appellant was aged between thirty-seven and thirty-nine. He had a previous criminal history, which included a number of convictions for false pretences, obtaining financial advantage by deception, and forging and uttering. He had served previous terms of imprisonment. There was evidence before the court of his personal history, which included some disruptive events in childhood. There were psychiatric reports which fell short of diagnosing a specific psychiatric illness, but suggested personality disorder. 
      
       
     155    Two complaints were made in relation to sentence. The first is that the accumulation of the two fixed terms in relation to counts 11 and 22 was not warranted. The second is that, having regard to the whole of the circumstances, the overall term is manifestly excessive. Reliance was placed upon the appellant’s evidence that he had obtained legal advice, and that investors were fully appraised of the speculative nature of the venture in which they invested.  
      
       
     156    I see no error in the accumulation of the sentences. In any event, if the accumulation had not been made, it would have been appropriate to extend the sentence in relation to count 18 to accommodate that six month period. Nor do I consider that the claim that the overall term was excessive has been substantiated. These were very serious offences, they were committed over an extend period of time, and they involved large sums of money. In this respect the sentencing judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “His criminal behaviour was deliberate, persistent, serious and wilful. His scheme to raise large sums of money from the public and its implementation were in some respects sophisticated, and involved practised deceit.” 
         
        
       
     157    I see no error in this assessment and it amply justifies the overall term imposed. I would grant leave to appeal against the severity of the sentences, but would dismiss the appeal. 
      
       
     158    The orders I propose are: 
      
       
        
       (i) on counts 12 and 13: appeal against conviction allowed, convictions quashed; 
        
        
       (ii) on all other counts: appeal against conviction dismissed; 
        
        
       (iii) the appellant be granted leave to appeal against sentence;  
        
        
       (iv) the appeal against the sentences imposed in relation to counts 12 and 13 be allowed, and the sentences imposed be quashed; 
        
        
       (v) in relation to all other counts, the appeal against sentence be dismissed. 
       
      159    NEWMAN AJ: I have had the advantage of reading the judgments of Mason P and Simpson J in this matter. I agree with both the reasons given by their Honours and the orders proposed.

     REGINA v Anthony James DALEY 
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
      HER HONOUR : 
      
    1    The accused was arraigned on an indictment containing 21 charges. Four counts are of detaining for advantage; five of aggravated sexual assault; three of attempted sexual assault; eight of armed robbery; and one of indecent assault. He indicated that he intended to plead not guilty to each charge. The Crown served on the accused’s legal representatives a brief of the evidence it proposed to adduce, together with a notice of intention to adduce both tendency and coincidence evidence (Evidence Act 1995, ss 97,98). The trial was fixed for hearing, with an estimate of six weeks, to commence on 7 May 2001. The charges involve allegations made by eight different complainants, all of them female. 
     
      
    2    By notice of motion filed on 30 April 2001, the accused sought a number of orders concerning the future progress of the trial. The first order he sought was for a separate trial of the charges relevant to each individual complainant - that is, that there be eight separate trials. As an alternative in the event of failure in relation to this application, he sought separate trials of groups of the charges, arranged by reference to common features, such as the dates or the locations of the alleged offences, or other common evidentiary features. 
     
      
    3    Further, he sought pre-trial rulings on whether certain identified aspects of the evidence would be admitted, either on a joint trial or on separate trials. This included, but was far from limited to, the proposed tendency and coincidence evidence. Indeed, it appeared to me that the challenged evidence covers a very large proportion of the Crown case. It was apparent that the rulings on the admission of evidence, especially the tendency and coincidence evidence, would have a significant bearing on the outcome of the separate trials application. If the challenge to the evidence were unsuccessful, there would be less basis for ordering separate trials. If, on the other hand, the tendency and/or coincidence evidence were excluded in relation to the allegations made by one or more of the complainants, then the case for separating the trials would have been stronger. Indeed, I was of the view that a separation of the charges relating to the individual applicants would inevitably follow a decision to exclude the tendency and/or coincidence evidence. The reason for that will become apparent when the Crown allegations are briefly stated. 
     
      
    4    In view of this conclusion, it is appropriate to consider the evidentiary matters first.  
     
      
    5    A voir dire commenced on 8 May and proceeded over almost two weeks. Virtually the whole of the Crown case was put before me, and I heard extensive argument on the admissibility of various components of the evidence in the Crown case. On 22 May I announced rulings on all evidentiary matters, reserving reasons, which were not then in final or deliverable form. These are those reasons. For completeness I should add that, on 24 May, when indicted, the accused pleaded guilty to six charges. These were two counts each of sexual intercourse without consent, armed robbery and detaining for advantage. Two victims were the subject of these counts. The accused indicated, pursuant to s 32(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, that he wanted the court to take into account an additional thirteen offences, being offences of which the accused admitted his guilt. These thirteen offences included all except two of the offences with which he had previously been charged. The matter was then stood over to 23 July to allow any evidence relevant to sentence, and submissions, to be put before the court. On that day the accused appeared unrepresented, having terminated his instructions to his legal representatives. He informed me that he wished to seek leave to withdraw his pleas of guilty, and his admission of guilt of the s 32 offences, and he wished to seek alternative legal representation. On 31 July he again appeared, this time with counsel, who confirmed the intention to seek leave to reverse the plea of guilty. That application has been fixed for hearing on 6 December 2001. 
     
      
    6    The reasons for my evidentiary rulings that follow were largely prepared before the accused sought to change his pleas. I have made no changes in substance following that indication; any editing has been as to form, or style. 
     
      
    7    I was provided with and read copies of statements of the witnesses the Crown intended to call. Whether this was the totality, or only part, of the Crown material, I do not know. It has enabled me to obtain an appreciation of, at least, the skeleton of the Crown case.  
     
      
    8    The Crown alleges that, on separate occasions over a period beginning on 5 September 1998 and ending on 7 July 2000, eight women were attacked. Five were sexually assaulted, one was indecently assaulted, and attempts were made sexually to assault three. (The indecent assault is alleged to have been committed on one of the victims who was also the subject of the attempted sexual assault; another victim was the subject of both a completed sexual assault and an attempted sexual assault. One woman was robbed but not sexually assaulted and no threat of, or attempt at, sexual assault was made.) Each complainant was allegedly robbed, and threatened with either a knife or a screwdriver. Four complainants were detained against their will, for the purpose either of sexual gratification or robbery or both. 
     
      
    9    It is the Crown case that a number of common threads permeate the description of the assaults upon the individual complainants. For example, it is alleged that in each case of sexual assault or attempted sexual assault, the assailant’s chosen form of intercourse was fellatio, although one complainant was also vaginally raped and another threatened with the same. There are a number of other asserted similarities in the behaviour alleged, to which I will return. From these similarities, the Crown contends that an inference may be drawn that the offences were all committed by the same man. From other evidence the Crown seeks to prove that that man was the accused. 
     
      
    10    It is convenient now to set out, in summary form, the nub of the allegations made by each complainant. They are set out below in chronological order. 
     
      
       
      Complainant 1 (CLI) 
       
      
    11    At about 8.55 pm on 5 September 1998 Complainant 1, then aged twenty-six years, drove to the Parramatta Golf Club to meet friends. She parked her car in the parking area, near some bushes. She was accosted by a man who was holding a knife in his right hand. He told her not to scream, told her that he had the knife, and demanded money. With his right arm around her he forced her to walk towards the bushes and onto the golf course. He asked her name and age and if she had any family. He told her to stay calm, not to scream, threatened that if she screamed he would cut her throat, and said that he had done this before and would not hesitate. He ordered Complainant 1 to get down on her knees, which she did; he walked in front of her, belatedly disguising his face with a black balaclava. He unzipped his pants, and exposed his penis which was erect; he asked Complainant 1 if she had ever given oral sex before. She said she had not and he asked if she had a boyfriend. He told her to put his penis in her mouth and then said “Put my dick in and out of your mouth”.  
     
      
       
      Complainant 1 became very upset. He told her to get on her back and take her pants off and threatened that if she did not obey he would hurt her. He told her not to panic. He then raped her vaginally. He kissed her first on the cheek, then on the mouth, forcing his tongue into her mouth. She resisted, he told her that if she did not kiss him properly he would cut her, and held the knife up behind her head. With his penis inside Complainant 1’s vagina, he ejaculated. He did up his own trousers and told Complainant 1 to get dressed.  
       
      
    12    He told her to empty her wallet and asked if she had a key card, how much money was in her account, demanded to be told her PIN, and asked if she had anything gold. He took a signet ring she was wearing.  
     
      
    13    He told her to lie on the ground, face down, and not to move or make a sound, threatening that if she did he would come back and hurt her. He ran off some distance. After about 20 seconds, Complainant 1 began to get up and he told her to stay where she was.  
     
      
       
      Complainant 2: (CMM) 
       
      
    14    At about 9.15 pm on Thursday 29 October, 1998, Complainant 2 parked her car in Rofe Street, Leichhardt, near her home. As she unloaded her vehicle she was approached by a man who asked her the time. When she answered she saw that he was holding a knife. He told her not to scream and that he wanted her bag. He took her backpack and left, saying “I’m desperate”. Complainant 2 was thirty-seven years of age at the time. 
     
      
       
      Complainant 3: (COM) 
       
      
    15    Complainant 3 was attacked at about 12.35 am on Saturday 31 October 1998 in Leichhardt. She was walking from a bus stop in Parramatta Road and was in Thornley Street. A man approached from in front of her, holding a screwdriver in his left hand at head height. He told her not to scream and that he needed money. He repeated “I’m desperate. I’m desperate.” He took Complainant 3’s handbag but then handed it back to her; with his hand on top of her head he pushed her to her knees, pulled his shorts down, exposing his penis, and told Complainant 3 to suck on his penis. He put his penis in her mouth. He then asked Complainant 3 if she had a boyfriend and when she said she did not he said that that was a shame because she was very good at what he was forcing her to do. She protested that she was going to be sick and mentioned neighbours who would be awake. He ordered her to finish what he had made her begin. She began to cry and he told her not to scream and mentioned the screwdriver. She gave him the bag and ran home. Complainant 3 was twenty-two years of age. 
     
      
       
      Complainant 4: (SAM) 
       
      
    16    Complainant 4, a forty year old woman, was also attacked in Leichhardt. At about 10.45 pm on Thursday 5 November 1998 she was walking from a bus stop in Norton Street. She was approached by a man who asked her the time, and then told her not to scream. He indicated a knife in his right hand and said that if she screamed he would jam the knife in her throat. He ordered Complainant 4 to give him her bag and asked how much money was in it, adding that he was desperate. He touched her on one of her shoulders and told her to get down on her knees. She asked why and he replied “I want a head job”. He insisted, but Complainant 4 firmly refused and began to walk up the steps of her house. He again demanded “a head job”, saying, again, “I’m desperate”. Complainant 4 again refused and opened her front door revealing her dog in the doorway. The man told her that he would leave the wallet the following day, and ran off. 
     
      
       
      Complainant 5 (EK) 
       
      
    17    At 10.50 pm on Thursday 20 April 2000 Complainant 5, aged thirty-four, drove into the garage of her home in Parramatta. A man was standing near the front of her car and asked her the time. She told him the time, and told him to go away. He walked towards her and she told him not to come any closer. He told her to listen, to shut up, or he would stab her. He was holding an object which she described as “long and silver” in his right hand. He told her to do as he told her or he would stab her to death, would kill her. He demanded her bag. She said there was $500 in it, and to take it. He told her to shut up and give it to him. He then told her to get down on her knees. He said “I want you to suck my cock”. She refused. He reminded her of his threat to stab her, unzipped his jeans and exposed his penis and told her “Just do it”. He put his penis in her mouth. He asked where her husband was and if she did this with her husband. He asked if she had done it before, if he were the first she had done it to, and if she liked it. She realised that the weapon she had previously thought was a knife was in fact a screw driver and pushed him away. He began running away and she chased him. He jumped over a fence, turned and said “Thanks for the head job”.  
     
      
       
      Complainant 6: (LR) 
       
      
    18    At 11.30 pm on 12 May 2000 Complainant 6 drove into the garage of her home unit block in Westmead. As she left the car a man approached her and asked her how much money she had. He was holding a knife in his right hand. He told her to do as he said or he would cut her throat. She agreed to do whatever he wanted and asked him not to hurt her and he led her from the garage, telling her to go with him. He again told her to do what he ordered, saying that unless she did would hurt her. He said: “I want a head job”. He led her to the side of a neighbouring house, pushed her against the fence and told her to get down. He lowered his shorts and exposed his penis and told her to put it in her mouth and start sucking. He was holding the knife in his right hand. He ordered her to put his penis in her mouth, and when she did, told her to put it further in. At the same time he pushed his penis further inside her mouth. Complainant 6 gagged and dry retched and the man told her to put it in or he would hurt her. He held the knife closer to her.  
     
      
    19    She apologised, saying she had never done this before, and this appeared to please him. He asked if he were her first, if she had a husband and if she lived alone. He told her she was beautiful, and said: “Deeper, deeper, come on or I’ll hurt you”. He was wearing a glove on his right hand.  
     
      
    20    The man then ordered Complainant 6 to lie on the ground “so I can stick in you”. She refused. He hesitated, put his penis back in her mouth, and said “I just want to come. Keep sucking. I want to come in your mouth. Come on or I’ll hurt you”. He began to ejaculate, and ordered Complainant 6 to swallow the semen or he would hurt her. She gagged and dry retched. The man withdrew his penis and masturbated to complete the ejaculation. 
     
      
    21    He then asked Complainant 6 how much money she had and she handed him her brief case. He told her to leave and began to walk away, turning and telling her not to turn around, not to follow him. Complainant 6 was thirty-five years of age. 
     
      
       
      Complainant 7: (JM) 
       
      
    22    At about 6.30 pm on Friday 23 June 2000 Complainant 7 left her employment at Westmead and began to drive off in her car. A man opened her car door. He was holding a knife in his left hand and told Complainant 7 to get into the back of the car and said that what he was doing was not a joke. She did as she was told. He then drove the car off, telling her to keep down and shut up. He told her to stop crying, and said if she was a good girl everything would be OK. He asked if she had any money, and asked her name. He said: “OK, Jen, if you’re a good girl everything’s going to be OK”. He continued to say this, but told her not to do anything stupid because he would not hesitate in hurting her. 
     
      
    23    He drove for a little while, and returned to Complainant 7’s place of employment. He told her to get out of the car, not to do anything stupid because he would not hesitate in hurting her, and referred to the knife. Complainant 7 alighted from the car, the man behind her, holding her left shoulder with his left hand, and holding the knife into her back with his right hand. He told her to get on her knees, and pushed her down. He told her that she knew what he wanted and exposed his penis which he put in her mouth. He said: “Give it to me good. Slow down. Give me a love bite on my knob”. He told her to lie down and when she did so she lifted her skirt and removed her underwear. He began to insert his penis into her vagina but she told him that she was wearing a tampon. He then said: “Have you ever been fucked up the arse?” She said she had not and asked him not to do that and he pulled her onto her knees, told her to “Finish it”, and re-inserted his penis in her mouth. He then asked if she had a boyfriend, if Complainant 7 did this to him and if the boyfriend ejaculated in her mouth. When she said he did not, he said “So I am going to be the first”. 
     
      
    24    The man began masturbating and told Complainant 7 to finish what she was doing, that he was going to ejaculate and that if she spilled any of the semen he would hurt her. He ejaculated in her mouth. She began to gag and he ordered her to swallow the semen.  
     
      
    25    The man then picked up Complainant 7 and guided her to a corner of the building, told her to lie face down between the building and the fence, and asked if she had any money in the bag. He told her to get up and not do anything stupid or he would hurt her. He said he would not hesitate in hurting her and told her that she was not the first girl that he had done this to.  
     
      
    26    The man was wearing black gloves. They returned to the car and he demanded all of her money, saying that he would leave her licence with her. He told Complainant 7 to lie down on the back seat of the car. He asked Complainant 7 what her boyfriend’s name was. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “If you want to blame anyone blame him. This is what he gets for messing with me or my boys. I’m going to kill your fucking boyfriend, he’s a fucking cunt. I’ve been paid to kill you, I’ve been watching you for weeks.” 
        
       
      
    27    The man wiped down the areas of the car that he had touched, told Complainant 7 to stay where she was and to give him a couple of seconds to get away, and ran off.  
     
      
      Complainant 7 was twenty-five years of age. 
       
       
      Complainant 8: (LPS) 
       
      
    28    At about 6.25 pm on Friday 7 July 2000, Complainant 8, who was twenty-one years of age, walked from the Westmead Railway Station to nearby Moree Avenue where her car was parked. She found that the back passenger’s quarter window was smashed and began to examine the damage. She was approached by a man who asked if she owned the car, and said that he had seen two men run away, about five or ten minutes earlier. He then grabbed Complainant 8 by the right shoulder, told her to listen, to do what he said and that he had a knife. He was holding a knife in his right hand, the blade about 5 cm from her neck. 
     
      
    29    He forced her away from the car, told her to do as he told her, and that he was not scared to kill her. He directed her to the garden in front of the house, still holding the knife in his right hand, and Complainant 8’s right shoulder with his left hand. He told her to get down on her knees. She asked why, and he said: “I want you to suck me”. She refused. He said: “Do you think I’m scared, I’m not scared to kill you”. She refused again. He then said: “Do you want me to fuck you?” She said she did not, and he then said: “Well come on and do it, just a blow job. I’m not scared to kill you.” 
     
      
    30    The man asked if she had any money and how much. He demanded that she kiss him. He said he would leave her alone if she kissed him properly. He kissed Complainant 8 on the mouth, still holding the knife, and moving it towards her. She screamed for help and the man moved away and jumped over the fence, walking towards Complainant 8’s car. He walked from the car taking with him her handbag.  
     
      
       
       • • • 
       
      
    31    It is the Crown case that the evidence gives rise to a powerful inference that the same man was responsible for all of the attacks, and that man was the accused. It seeks to adduce evidence of the following kinds:- 
     
      
       
      (i) DNA evidence linking the accused with the assaults on Complainants 1 and 6; 
       
       
      (ii) evidence that Complainants 4, 5 and 7 identified the accused from an array of photographs shown to them by police; 
       
       
      (iii) evidence that, from a series of tape recordings played to them by police, each of Complainants 1, 3, 4, 6 and 7 identified the accused’s voice as the voice of her attacker,  
       
       
      (iv) evidence that each complainant participated in an examination of clothing belonging to the accused and identified certain items as the clothing, or similar to the clothing, worn by her attacker; 
       
       
      (v) evidence that each complainant was shown an array of knives and screw drivers and identified an implement as similar to the weapon used by her attacker. 
       
       
      1. Tendency & Coincidence Evidence 
      
    32    The evidence identified by the Crown as both tendency and coincidence evidence was encapsulated in a schedule attached to the notice of intention to rely on evidence of that kind. For convenience, a copy of the schedule, with the complainants rendered anonymous, is attached to this judgment. Put shortly, the Crown seeks to rely, as both tendency and coincidence evidence, on features of the accounts of the attacks upon them given by the complainants. The schedule reveals, as does the short summary of each of the attacks upon the complainants above, a number of recurring features. This is not to say that all complainants gave identical accounts of the attacks upon them; there were, of course, some differences. However, the Crown asserts, and seeks by the evidence to prove, that a pattern can be discerned, and that the common features were such as to justify a conclusion that the same man was responsible for all offences. The similarities, or common features, on which the Crown seeks to rely include the locations in which the offences were committed (five in a small area of the Parramatta - Westmead District, three in Leichhardt); the time of day (after dark); the approach made to the victim by the offender; where the victim was sexually assaulted, or where an attempt at sexual assault, or a demand for sexual gratification was made, the chosen mode of sexual assault (forced fellatio); that the offender was armed with a knife or similar weapon; that the victim was robbed as well as assaulted; the language used by the offender; and the offender’s manner of departure from the scene. 
     
      
    33    The accused resists the admission of the evidence, either as tendency or as coincidence evidence. As a preliminary point, he challenges its characterisation as tendency evidence. He makes no such challenge to the characterisation of the evidence as coincidence evidence. 
     
      
    34    “Tendency evidence” is defined in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act as evidence of a kind referred to in s97(1) that a party seeks to have adduced for the purpose referred to in that subsection.  
     
      
    35    S 97 is relevantly in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person’s character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind, if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the party adducing the evidence has not given reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the court thinks that the evidence would not, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence have significant probative value.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      
    36    “Tendency evidence” is, therefore, evidence adduced for the purpose of proving that a person had a tendency to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind. No doubt the most common application of tendency evidence, where admitted, is to lay the foundation for an inference that the person in question, by reason of his or her tendency to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind, did, on a relevant occasion, act in that way, or acted with that state of mind or with a particular motivation. Such evidence is apt to fix the person whose tendency has been proved with responsibility for an act which otherwise might not be able to be attributed to him or her; or to negative a suggestion that an event occurred accidentally. 
     
      
    37    The end point of the admission of evidence as tendency evidence, it seems to me, is most likely to be the conclusion that the person concerned was the person who did an act in question; or that a person, whose tendency has been proved, did an act in question with a relevant state of mind.  
     
      
    38    It is to be observed, in passing, that s 97 is directed to the admissibility of tendency evidence in both civil and criminal proceedings. There are particular restrictions, to which it will be necessary to refer in due course, on the admission of tendency evidence (and coincidence evidence) in criminal proceedings. 
     
      
    39    In differentiating between tendency evidence and coincidence evidence counsel for the accused made a valid point. While the two concepts have elements in common, have a common origin, and are often referred to as though interchangeable, and while the criteria for admission are in both cases identical, the drafters of the Evidence Act quite clearly and deliberately drew a distinction between the two kinds of evidence. 
     
      
    40    That the tests of admissibility are identical, and that there is no challenge to the characterisation of the evidence as coincidence evidence, does not obviate the need to determine the issue raised as to the characterisation of the evidence as tendency evidence. That is because, should the evidence be admitted, appropriate directions to the jury will be necessary.  
     
      
    41    For completeness, I note that the Evidence Act Dictionary definition of coincidence evidence is in terms that parallel the definition of tendency evidence. “Coincidence evidence” is defined as evidence of a kind referred to in s 98(1) that a party seeks to have adduced for the purpose referred to that subsection. 
     
      
    42    The coincidence rule is contained in s 98, relevantly in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Evidence that 2 or more related events occurred is not admissible to prove that, because of the improbability of the events occurring coincidentally, a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the party adducing the evidence has not given reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the court thinks that the evidence would not, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) For the purposes of sub section (1), 2 or more events are taken to be related events if and only if: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) they are substantially and relevantly similar, and 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the circumstances in which they occurred are substantially similar.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    43    Broadly speaking, ss 97 and 98 are, effectively, statutory formulations (or reformulations) of the common law concepts of, respectively, “propensity” and “similar fact” evidence. There has not always been as clear a distinction drawn between evidence of the two kinds as is now drawn in the Evidence Act, and too categorically to relate tendency evidence to propensity evidence and coincidence evidence to similar fact evidence would be potentially erroneous. The analogy is of the broadest kind. The admissibility of tendency and coincidence evidence is now governed primarily by the provisions of the Evidence Act. To the extent (if any) that the principles developed by the common law are inconsistent with provisions of the Evidence Act, the latter must prevail: R v OGD[No.2] [2000] NSW CCA 404; 50 NSWLR 433. 
     
      
       
      Is the evidence “tendency evidence? 
       
      
    44    Before turning to the criteria for admissibility of evidence of either kind, it is convenient to dispose of the challenge to the characterisation of the evidence as tendency evidence. The evidence outlined in the schedule can be dealt with as a whole, since there was no contention that certain parts of it raised issues different from any other parts of it. The approach taken by counsel was based on the assumption that, if any part of the evidence in question was tendency evidence, then it all came within that category; and, similarly, if any part of it was not within that category, then none of it was. 
     
      
    45    Notwithstanding the validity of the distinction to which counsel drew attention, the challenge to the characterisation of the evidence as tendency evidence fails. It is, in my opinion, based upon a misconception about what the drafters of s 97 intended to be encompassed by that section.  
     
      
    46    The argument advanced on behalf of the accused was, in essence, that because the accused has neither admitted, nor been convicted of, any of the conduct evidence of which is tendered as tendency evidence, that conduct (or alleged conduct) cannot be used to prove that he had a tendency to act in that way, or to have a particular state of mind. In other words, so the argument went, the tender of the evidence on that basis assumed the truth of the allegations made against the accused.  
     
      
    47    The argument had some initial appeal, but it does not withstand analysis. It may be that the proposition contained in the argument was founded upon a single sentence in the judgment of Deane J in Sutton v R (1984) 152 CLR 528, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the other hand, if the similarities between the offences which the accused undoubtedly committed and the offence with which he is charged are such as to warrant, in the context of all the evidence, the conclusion that, in the absence of extraordinary coincidence, the same person committed all the offences or if the similarity between the evidence of different witnesses as to different offences which the accused is said by them to have committed is so striking “that they must, when judged by experience and common sense, either all be true, or have arisen from a cause common to the witnesses or from pure coincidence…” 
         
        
       
      Emphasis is to be placed on the word “undoubtedly” appearing in the second line. 
       
      
    48    In Pfennig v R (1995) 182 CLR 461, the tendency of the accused that the Crown sought to prove was a tendency sexually to molest young boys. The High Court held that the evidence was admissible for that purpose. However, there, as counsel correctly pointed out, the conduct in question was the subject of an admission by the accused. 
     
      
    49    Pfennig was, therefore, an instance of a case in which a high degree of certainty attended the proof of the conduct relied upon to establish tendency; the passage extracted from Sutton above, supports the argument that a high level of cogency is required before evidence of tendency may properly be admitted (or at least, was required in the evidentiary regime that pre-dated the enactment of the Evidence Act). But questions of admissibility are not to be confused with the question of the proper characterisation of the evidence and that is the present issue. 
     
      
    50    By reason of the definition contained in the Dictionary, and s 97, tendency evidence is “evidence of the character, reputation, or conduct of a person …”. For present purposes, character and reputation may be put to one side; neither raises its head in the current issue. There is nothing in s 97 that requires that, before evidence of conduct tendered as tendency may properly be so described, the conduct must be admitted or proved to any particular level of probability or certainty. 
     
      
    51    Applying the plain words of the section to the challenged evidence, it would be open to the Crown (questions of admissibility aside) to seek to prove the accused’s tendency to act in a particular way by seeking to prove that he had acted in that, or in a relevant, way, on another occasion or other occasions. Thus, in seeking to prove the accused was guilty of the offences committed against Complainant 1, it would be open to the Crown (again, I emphasise, other questions of admissibility aside) to seek to prove that he had committed relevantly similar offences against Complainants 2 - 8. Such an approach is consistent with the pre-Evidence Act regime. In Hoch v R (1988) 165 CLR 292, Mason CJ, Wilson and Gaudron JJ wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “Where the happening of the matters said to constitute similar facts is not in dispute and there is evidence to connect the accused person with one or more of the happening evidence of those similar facts may render it objectively improbable that a person other than the accused committed the act in question, that the relevant act was unintended, or that it occurred innocently or fortuitously. Similar fact evidence is then admissible as evidence relevant to that issue.” 
        
       
      
    52    In Pfennig v R ((1995) 182 CLR 461, at 530), McHugh J, referring to “similar fact cases”, wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “In these cases, the propensity of the accused will usually only be established by the verdict.” 
        
       
      
    53    This passage, though directed to “similar fact” evidence, has equal application to propensity, or tendency, evidence. There is nothing in the passage, and nothing in the section, to suggest that the evidence tendered to prove tendency must be of conduct which is established otherwise than through the evidence in the relevant proceedings. It would, of course, be open to the party against whom the evidence was tendered to deny, through evidence, that the person had engaged in the conduct in question; and it may be, in some cases, that discrete issues of fact will arise; and it is not difficult to envisage that proceedings may become rather cumbersome. But that is nothing to do with whether the evidence falls into the category of tendency evidence. I am satisfied that the circumstance that the conduct upon which the Crown seeks to rely has not been admitted, and has not previously been proved, does not operate to prevent it falling into the category of tendency evidence. I am, indeed, satisfied that the evidence upon which the Crown seeks to rely sits comfortably within the definition of tendency evidence as well as the definition of coincidence evidence. 
     
      
       
       • • • 
       
      
    54    That being so, it is necessary to consider the consequential questions of admissibility. In this respect, the admissibility tests being identical, the evidence, considered under the twin rubrics of tendency and coincidence evidence, may be considered together. No issues arise requiring separate consideration. 
     
      
    55    Two admissibility tests specific to tendency and coincidence evidence are imposed by the Evidence Act . Both s 97 and s 98 contain a threshold test, applicable in both civil and criminal cases. Evidence, whether tendency or coincidence, is not to be admitted unless, either alone or in conjunction with other evidence already adduced or to be adduced, it would, in the opinion of the court, have significant probative value.  
     
      
    56    “Probative value” is defined in the Dictionary as meaning: 
     
      
       
        
        “The extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue.” 
        
       
      
    57    In R v Lockyer (1996) 89 A Crim R 457 and subsequently in R v Lock (unreported, 25 March 1997) Hunt CJ at CL expressed the view that the word “significant” should be interpreted as meaning “important”, or “of consequence”, and appeared to agree with the proposition earlier expressed by Dowd J (R v Lewis, unreported, 20 June 1996) that it means something less than “substantial”. His Honour also took the view that the significance of the evidence in question must be assessed by reference to the nature of “the fact in issue” to which it is relevant and the significance or importance which it may have in establishing “the fact in issue”. 
     
      
    58    In order to consider whether a particular piece of evidence has or has not significant probative value, it is necessary to focus, with some precision, upon the “fact [or facts] in issue” to which the evidence is directed.  
     
      
    59    The principal fact in issue, for present purposes, is the identity of the accused as the attacker of any - or all - of the complainants. It may be more accurate to say that, in the case of each complainant, the principal fact in issue is the identity of the accused as the attacker of that complainant. However, it seems to me that another fact, almost certainly in issue (although the accused has not, and has not been required to, disclose his defence or his defence tactics) is whether or not the evidence establishes that it was the same man who attacked all (or some) of the complainants.  
     
      
    60    It is to be borne in mind that, in determining whether the evidence has significant probative value, other evidence with which it may interact is relevant. 
     
      
    61    Firstly, via s 97, the Crown may seek to prove that the accused had a tendency to act in a particular way: for example, by accosting lone women after dark, in one of two limited geographical areas, to threaten them with a knife or similar instrument; to demand and take money; to demand sexual engagement of a very particular kind; to engage in conversation with very particular characteristics; and to leave the victim at the scene after the sexual assault.  
     
      
    62    In relation to each victim, there is some evidence linking the accused with the assault. In many cases there is identification evidence, although the identifications were made with varying degrees of confidence. In the cases of some victims, leaving aside evidence of attacks on other victims, the evidence is weaker than others. However, in relation to two victims, the evidence linking the accused with the crimes appears to be extremely strong. In these cases there is DNA evidence which may be interpreted as establishing that there exists only a one in ten billion chance that the accused was not the assailant. With those cases as a starting point, and taking the description of the attacks given by those victims, the probative value of the evidence is obvious, and somewhat more than significant. The evidence of the circumstances of the attacks on victims other than those two forms part of a chain which a jury might find inculpated the accused in all or some of the attacks.  
     
      
    63    The other approach, via s 98, is for the Crown to seek to prove, because of the improbability that the various attacks occurred coincidentally (that is, were committed by a variety of different individuals) that all (or some) were committed by the same person. Again, if the Crown can show that the accused was the perpetrator of one (or more) of the attacks, then the probative value of the evidence is more than merely significant. In Pfennig it was pointed out that similar fact evidence is a variety of circumstantial evidence (p482) and is, therefore capable of gaining strength from other aspects of the evidence. 
     
      
    64    I am satisfied that nothing in ss97 or 98 precludes the admission of the evidence. 
     
      
    65    The next hurdle imposed by the Evidence Act arises by reason of s 101(2), which applies only in criminal proceedings, and which is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(2) Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant”. 
         
        
       
      
    66    S 101(2) requires an assessment of the probative value of the evidence relative to its prejudicial effect on the accused. The evidence is not admissible unless the former substantially outweighs the latter. Except for the introduction of the adverb “substantially” the section enacts a test not essentially different from that developed by the common law. That this is so is well illustrated by reference to the High Court decision in Pfennig, to which I have already referred. In that case the accused was charged with the murder of a young boy whose body had not been found. The Crown case was that the accused had abducted the boy for sexual purposes and subsequently killed him. The Crown adduced evidence that, on a date after the disappearance of the boy, the accused had abducted and raped another boy a few years older. He had pleaded guilty to the charges in relation to the older boy. The events that gave rise to those charges, and to the plea of guilty, bore similarities, in significant respects, to the events the Crown sought to prove in the murder trial. In their consideration of relevant Australian authorities, the majority in the High Court (Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ) wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was also accepted that, in order to be admissible, propensity evidence must possess ‘a strong degree of probative force’ or the probative force of the evidence must clearly transcend the prejudicial effect of mere criminality or propensity.” ( p 481, internal references omitted) 
        
       
      
    67    The phrase “the probative force of the evidence must clearly transcend the prejudicial effect of mere criminality or propensity” was drawn from an earlier High Court decision, R v Perry (1982) 150 CLR 580. 
     
      
    68    The majority in Pfennig  went on to propose a test of admissibility in the same terms as the test a jury is directed to apply in dealing with circumstantial evidence (that is, whether there is a rational view of the evidence consistent with the innocence of the accused) and wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “Only if there is no such view can one safely conclude that the probative force of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.” (pp482-3) 
        
       
      
    69    Again, their Honours wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “Because propensity evidence may well have a prejudicial effect which is disproportionate to the probative force of that evidence, it is necessary to maintain an insistence on that evidence having a high level or degree of cogency in the circumstances of the particular case.” (p 487) 
        
       
      
    70    Toohey J took a slightly different approach. He quoted from the judgment of Mason CJ, Wilson and Gaudron JJ in Hoch (supra) in which their Honours wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “The criterion of its admissibility is the strength of its probative force.” (p 507) 
        
       
      
    71    However, his Honour went on to identify the task of the trial judge confronted with a question of the tender of such evidence as being: 
     
      
       
        
        “to consider the prejudicial effect of the evidence and whether, in the circumstances, it is just to admit it.” (p507) 
        
       
      
    72    His Honour observed that this was not precisely the same as saying that the evidence is admissible if its probative force exceeds it prejudicial effect. 
     
      
    73    McHugh J wrote that, because the use of propensity reasoning created too great a risk of an unfair trial, the Court had: 
     
      
       
        
        “… insisted that as a matter of law and not discretion the probative value of the evidence must outweigh or transcend its prejudicial effect.” (p528) 
        
       
       
      He added: 
       
       
        
        “The judge must compare the probative strength of the evidence with the degree of risk of an unfair trial if the evidence is admitted. Admitting the evidence will serve the interests of justice only if the judge concludes that the probative force of the evidence compared to the degree of risk of an unfair trial is such that fair minded people would think that the public interest in adducing all relevant evidence of guilt must have priority over the risk of an unfair trial.” (p 529) 
        
       
      
    74    I have set out these passages at some length, because, it seems to me, the criteria for admission of similar fact or propensity evidence at common law that emerges is the test that has been adopted, slightly adapted, and re-stated in s101(2). The addition of the adverb “substantially” is not, however, to be overlooked. The point of this exercise is to demonstrate that, as the common law and statutory tests are essentially of the same kind, decisions as to admissibility made under the common law are not rendered redundant in relation to decisions as to admissibility under the Evidence Act, and that guidance may be obtained from the reasoning in previously decided cases.  
     
      
    75    That leads me back to a number of additional passages to be found in the judgments in Pfennig. The majority wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “Very often, propensity evidence is received when there is a striking similarity between different offences or between the evidence of different witnesses. In particular, it was recognised that the existence of such striking similarity is necessary in cases such as  
        Sutton 
         where the prosecution seeks to lead the evidence on the basis that the similarity between different offences founds a conclusion that they must have been committed by the one person with the consequence that evidence which would be admissible to show that an accused committed one of the offences is admissible to prove that he or she committed another or the others of them.” (481) 
        
       
       
        
        “… evidence of a particular distinctive propensity demonstrated by acts constituting particular manifestations or exemplifications of it will have greater cogency, so long as it has some specific connection with or relation to the issues for decision in the subject case. That evidence, as has been said, will be admissible only if its probative value exceeds it prejudicial effect.” (p 483) 
        
       
       
        
        “Often that high level or degree of cogency is found in the striking similarity, underlying unity or ‘signature’ pattern common to the incidents disclosed by the totality of the evidence.” (p488) 
        
       
      
    76    One passage from Sutton (supra) may also be quoted. Brennan J (as he then was) wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “Striking similarity between the alleged similar fact and the fact to be proved inferentially is a frequent, but not the only, indication of that cogency or that probative force which is required if the evidence is to be taken out of the primary exclusionary rule.” (p549) 
        
       
      
    77    With these principles in mind, I turn to apply the test as stated by the majority in Pfennig. Perhaps rather incongruously, it became necessary to make an evaluation of the evidence which was similar to, or the same as, that which a jury would, if the evidence were admitted, be required to make. But the approach is quite different. That is because, ordinarily, (as in the present exercise) the judge ruling on whether the evidence is to be admitted or not will perform the evaluation on the basis of witness statements or written outlines of the anticipated evidence. The assessment of the probative value of the evidence is less an assessment of the credibility or reliability of the witness (although I do not discount the possibility that that may at times be required), but an assessment of the probative value of the evidence in the context of the evidence of the case as a whole, and on the assumption that the witness is accepted by the jury as credible. 
     
      
    78    Performing that function, I found myself quite satisfied that the evidence meets the stringent test required. I started with the proposition put by counsel for the accused, which is plainly correct, that the evidence will have an enormously prejudicial effect on the accused. To put before a jury evidence designed to establish that an accused person has committed not one, but seven sexual assaults, all having similar characteristics, would be to put a very strong case indeed. The evidence of the offences relating to each individual victim would gather strength from the evidence relating to each of the others. I was under no illusion about the potential prejudicial effect of the evidence of tendency and coincidence. The evidence in relation to each attack would magnify the evidence in relation to each other attack.  
     
      
    79    However, the phrase “prejudicial effect” is apt to create a false impression. All evidence tendered against an accused is intended to have a prejudicial effect, in the sense that it is intended to be part of the evidence which establishes guilt. So it is in the present case. The evidence in question potentially has a powerful prejudicial effect because it tends to establish that the accused was guilty of these very serious offences.  
     
      
    80    It is against that powerful prejudicial effect that the probative value of the evidence must be weighed, keeping firmly in mind that, before it could be admitted, the probative value must not only outweigh its prejudicial effect, but do so substantially. 
     
      
    81    As I have observed above, performing the exercise required involves making an assessment of the probative value of the evidence in the absence of an assessment either of the credibility or the reliability, of the various witnesses, and in the absence of hearing any cross-examination of the Crown witnesses, including those who are expected to give expert evidence. I have no idea what contrary evidence might be produced on behalf of the accused. There are, apart from the tendency and coincidence evidence now under consideration, some important aspects of the evidence to which brief reference should be made (more detailed reference to these matters is to be found elsewhere in this judgment). The Crown has tendered DNA evidence which, on its face, must be taken, virtually unanswerably, certainly overwhelmingly, to implicate the accused in the offences against Complainants 1 and 6. If the tendency and coincidence evidence were considered by the jury sufficient to demonstrate that the same person was responsible for any other attack, then the DNA evidence establishing (if the jury so finds) the accused’s guilt of those offences will also operate to strengthen the Crown evidence against the accused in relation to that other attack. To the DNA evidence may be added evidence of the nature of the offences against Complainants 1 and 6, the circumstances in which the offences were committed, the details of conversation, robbery and so forth. Those details are available to link the accused with offences against other victims, to establish that it was the same person who attacked those other victims. The result is that, in the context of the evidence overall, the probative value of the tendency and coincidence evidence (assuming it to be accepted by the jury) is greater even than its admittedly mighty prejudicial effect. 
     
      
    82    For those reasons, s 101 does not operate to preclude the admission of the tendency and coincidence evidence. 
     
      
    83    In relation to this evidence, counsel finally invoked ss 135 and 137, contained in Part 3.11 of the Evidence Act, which is headed “Discretion to Exclude Evidence”. 
     
      
    84    S 135 confers a true discretion to exclude evidence in either civil or criminal cases, in the circumstances herein outlined. The section provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “The court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party, or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) be misleading or confusing, or 
        
       
       
        
        (c) cause or result in undue waste of time.” 
        
       
      
    85    I did not understand any argument to have been advanced that either paragraph (b) or (c) has application. The argument centred upon the contention that the evidence would be unfairly prejudicial, and that its probative value would be substantially outweighed by the unfair prejudice created. This raises a slightly different issue from that raised by s 101, where the prejudice, to warrant exclusion of the evidence in question, is not required to be “unfair”. Nothing that would render the evidence “unfairly prejudicial” as distinct from “prejudicial” was identified. The mere fact that the evidence strengthens the Crown case does not make it unfairly prejudicial. “The concept” of “unfair prejudice” is concerned with, for example, evidence that an accused person might not be able to meet, or that is likely to have an uwarranted impact on a jury, or lead to improper modes of reasoning. I am unable to perceive any unfair prejudice that might accrue to the accused from the admission of the evidence in question, such as to outweigh its probative value. The precondition to the exercise of the discretion conferred (that the balancing process results in a conclusion that the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighs the probative value of the evidence) has not been established, and, accordingly no occasion arises for the exercise of the discretion envisaged by s 135. 
     
      
    86    S 137 applies only in criminal proceedings. It does not, strictly, confer a discretion, but requires yet again an evaluative process which is akin to the exercise of a discretion. Where the evaluative process results in a conclusion that the probative value of the evidence in question is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused the court is obliged to reject the evidence. 
     
      
    87    For the reasons given above, I can see no danger of unfair prejudice to the accused by the admission of the evidence in question. I can, on the other hand, as indicated above, see great probative value in the evidence. S 137 does not avail the accused.  
     
      
    88    That concludes the matters raised in opposition to the admission of the evidence the Crown proposes to call as tendency and coincidence evidence. I ruled that the evidence, being relevant, probative, and not excluded by any provision of the Evidence Act, it would be admitted in full. 
     
      
       
      2 DNA evidence 
       
      
    89    In relation to two of the complainants, DNA evidence was obtained.  
     
      
       
      (i) Following the sexual assault upon her (which included penile penetration of her vagina) Complainant 1 was taken to Westmead Hospital, where she was examined in accordance with the protocols devised for the investigation of allegations of sexual assault. Forensic swabs were taken from her vulva, vagina and mouth. Those from the vulva and vagina proved positive for seminal fluid which was retained for DNA analysis. An obvious inference is that the semen was the semen of the attacker. A DNA profile was prepared. 
       
       
      (ii) Clothing worn by Complainant 6 was tested for semen and returned a positive result and a DNA profile was taken. It proved to be identical to the profile of the DNA obtained from Complainant 1. 
       
       
      The test results in each case were retained by the investigating police for future use in the event that a suspect was apprehended. 
       
      
    90    On 4 July 2000 Detective Senior Constable Neil Tuckerman assumed command of the investigation into the offences (codenamed “Strike Force Sapelo”). By this time investigators had come to the view, as a result of the DNA evidence obtained in relation to the assaults on Complainants 1 and 6, that those two offences had been committed by the same person. An evaluation of the circumstances and characteristics of the descriptions given by other complainants led investigators to believe that there was a link between the offences committed against at least five of the complainants. (The evidence does not disclose which three of the eight complainants besides Complainants 1 and 6, these were. It does not, for present purposes, matter.) 
     
      
    91    On 7 July Detective Tuckerman issued Operation Orders which named only the accused as a suspect and nominated as the main objective of the operation the subject of those orders “to obtain a DNA sample from [the accused] through covert surveillance”. 
     
      
    92    Officers participating in Strike Force Sapelo maintained surveillance on the accused. On 14 July he was seen to be behaving in a rather unusual fashion. At 7.51 pm he walked into a laneway at Westmead, lay on his stomach for about fifteen seconds, then rose and walked to his car which was parked nearby. He sat in the driver’s seat for about nine minutes. This was not the first incident of unusual behaviour that had been observed. In the morning of 29 June a man (believed to be the accused) had been observed by a resident standing on the ledge of a wall looking into the backyard of a townhouse at Oatlands. The following morning at about the same time the same resident saw the same man emerge from bushes around the adjoining townhouse. On each occasion the man drove off in the same vehicle, the registration number of which was the registration number of the vehicle regularly driven by the accused.  
     
      
    93    As a result of these incidents Detective Tuckerman formed the view that, if the accused were indeed the person responsible for the assaults (or any or some of them), there was a real risk that a ninth attack was imminent.  
     
      
    94    Detective Tuckerman knew that the vehicle the accused drove was unregistered and uninsured. Having taken advice from within the Police Service, he arranged for Constable Scott Glynn, of the Highway Patrol, to stop the vehicle, purportedly in the exercise of routine Highway Patrol duties. At about 8:40 pm on 14 July Constable Glynn did pull up the accused whilst he was driving the vehicle on the M4 Motorway. Constable Glynn told the accused that he had been stopped for the purposes of a “random breath test”. (Whatever else this test was, it was anything but “random”.) He then conducted a breath analysis examination. This required the accused to exhale into a breath test tube. Constable Glynn inspected the accused’s vehicle, observed that the registration label did not carry the appropriate receipt evidencing registration, and arrested the accused and drove him to the Parramatta Police Station. There he issued a Traffic Infringement Notice in relation to three offences under the relevant Road Transport legislation. He sealed the container on which the breath test had been conducted and handed that to another officer. A sample of the accused’s DNA was obtained from the container and a profile prepared. Later comparison with the DNA samples from Complainants 1 and 6 established that the attacker in each case had the same DNA as the accused. The probabilities against the attacker in each case being the accused was put at one in ten billion. 
     
      
    95    At the conclusion of the formalities relating to the Road Transport charges the accused was taken to an interview room where Detectives Tuckerman and Cox were waiting. Between 11.57pm and 12.37am the following morning (that is 15 July) he was interviewed and the interview was electronically recorded. The various allegations of sexual assault were put to him and the accused either declined to answer questions or denied the allegations.  
     
      
    96    At about 4.00 am the accused was released from custody. Detective Tuckerman told him that he had a search warrant for his home address. The accused accompanied police officers to his home where a search began at 4.40 am. It concluded at 6.20 am. 
     
      
    97    The search warrant authorised search and seizure of eighteen described items. Most of these were items of clothing described in the warrant; the others were a 15 cm knife, a pocket knife, an orange handled screwdriver and a mobile phone. The items of clothing conformed with the descriptions, given by the various complainants, of the clothing worn by the attacker. 
     
      
    98    During the course of the search the accused was asked to remove the clothing he was then wearing. This included a pair of shorts, a jacket and a T-shirt. These items, together with others taken during the course of the search, were transferred to the Police Station and treated as exhibits in the investigation. 
     
      
    99    The T-shirt that the accused had been wearing was subjected to a test for DNA. It also yielded a result that established a significant, if not overwhelming, probability that the DNA was that of the assailant of Complainants 1 and 6. 
     
      
    100    On 31 July Detective Tuckerman received information from Ms Michelle Franco, a forensic biologist who conducted the DNA tests on the various items that had been submitted to her. At 6.15 pm that evening he received a preliminary report from her. That report was sufficient to justify the arrest of the accused. It contained the DNA matching mentioned above. The accused was, accordingly, arrested at about 6.40 pm that day. He was taken to Parramatta Police Station where he was again interviewed. A summary of the allegations of each of the complainants was put to him. He maintained his intention to exercise his right to silence. Detective Tuckerman asked him if he was willing to provide a blood sample for DNA comparison tests and the accused declined, citing advice from his solicitor as the reason. He declined to take part in an identification parade. The accused was charged at the conclusion of the interview. 
     
      
    101    After the accused had been charged Detective Tuckerman told him that he was obliged to provide blood or a saliva sample for DNA testing purposes. The accused refused to provide blood. There followed a discussion between Detective Tuckerman and the accused, who continued to refuse to provide a sample.  
     
      
    102    At 12.30 the following morning, 1 August, Detective Campbell pursued the issue of obtaining a blood sample or saliva sample. He gave the accused a copy of s 353A(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 and explained that the section authorised a doctor at the direction of a sergeant or superior officer to obtain a sample. The accused continued to refuse. Dr Stewart was present throughout this conversation. 
     
      
    103    At about 3.00pm the same day detectives returned to the issue. On this occasion Dr Moynham, a police medical officer, Detective Inspector McKay, and other police officers attended the clinic at the Corrective Services Cells at Parramatta where they saw the accused. The entitlement to take a blood sample was again explained to the accused, and he again refused. Detective Inspector McKay told him that police were permitted to use force to obtain the sample by injection but that they preferred to take a saliva swab from his mouth. By this time the accused had spoken to solicitors and had received advice. Eventually he agreed to provide a saliva sample (buccal swabs). Testing of these swabs had the same result as the earlier obtained DNA samples. It established a high, indeed overwhelming, probability that the accused was the man who had assaulted Complainants 1 and 6. 
     
      
       
       • • • 
       
      
    104    The accused seeks the exclusion of the evidence of the DNA obtained as a result of breath analysis test, the sweat ingrained T-shirt, and the buccal swab. Although, in each case, objection is based on discretionary matters, the factual and other issues that arise are not identical.  
     
      
       
      The breath test container 
       
      
    105    The argument advanced on behalf of the accused in relation to the DNA evidence obtained as a result of the breath test was that the sample was obtained by trickery, by subterfuge, and that it resulted from the improper exercise of the power to arrest. The accused does not dispute that he was in fact guilty of the motor vehicle offences with which he was charged. Counsel provided a copy of s 18 of the Road Transport (Vehicle Registration) Act 1997 which creates the offence of using an unregistered registrable vehicle on a road, and which provides for a maximum penalty of twenty penalty units. One aspect of the argument advanced on behalf of the accused was that, by reference to the penalty, that offence should be seen as one low on the calendar of criminal offences, and one which should be prosecuted, not by arrest and charge, but by summons. 
     
      
    106    I accept that the penalty provided for by the legislature does not suggest that the offence of driving an unregistered vehicle is at the high end of the scale of criminal offences. I further accept that prosecutions for less serious offences may properly be initiated in the usual course by summons rather than by arrest and charge. However, on this occasion the accused was apprehended in the act of committing the offences. In such circumstances an arrest, at least to prevent the continuation of the commission of the offences, or commission of further offences, seems to me to be not inappropriate. S 352 of the Crimes Act 1900 provides the statutory authorities for arrest in those circumstances. 
     
      
    107    I am quite satisfied that the arrest of the accused in relation to the road traffic charges was no more than a pretext. Although the accused was issued with a Traffic Infringement Notice, the dominant and real purpose of the arrest was to obtain, by covert means, a sample of the accused’s DNA, so that it could be compared with the DNA of the man who had assaulted Complainants 1 and 6. Neither Detective Tuckerman nor Constable Glynn pretended otherwise. The true purpose for which the power to arrest was exercised was not the enforcement of the road traffic laws; it was to enable police to obtain a sample of the accused’s bodily fluids to enable DNA matching to take place. 
     
      
    108    Counsel argued that, in those circumstances, the evidence comes within s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995 and ought, on the application of that section, be excluded. S 138 relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        138. Exclusion of improperly or illegally obtained evidence 
          
         
        (1) 
         Evidence that was obtained:  
         
        (a) improperly or in contravention of an Australian law, or  
         
        (b) in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law,  
         
        is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained.  
         
         
        (2) 
         … 
         
         
        (3) 
         Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account under subsection (1), it is to take into account:  
         
        (a) the probative value of the evidence, and  
         
        (b) the importance of the evidence in the proceeding, and  
         
        (c) the nature of the relevant offence, cause of action or defence and the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and  
         
        (d) the gravity of the impropriety or contravention, and  
         
        (e) whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless, and  
         
        (f) whether the impropriety or contravention was contrary to or inconsistent with a right of a person recognised by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and  
         
        (g) whether any other proceeding (whether or not in a court) has been or is likely to be taken in relation to the impropriety or contravention, and  
         
        (h) the difficulty (if any) of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law.  
        
       
       
      
    109    There are, in fact, two questions that arise when s 138 is invoked. The first is whether the evidence is evidence obtained improperly or in contravention of an Australian law, or in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law. If that question is not answered affirmatively, then the s 138 balancing process does not arise. It is only if the evidence is properly characterised as evidence of that kind that the second question, whether the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence obtained in the way the particular evidence under consideration was obtained, arises.  
     
      
       
      Impropriety 
       
      
    110    I have attempted to make it perfectly plain that I am satisfied that the powers conferred on police officers under road traffic legislation were used for a purpose essentially extraneous to the purpose for which they were conferred. The purpose for which the power to arrest is conferred to enforce the law. In this case, the power to arrest was purportedly to enforce the road transport law. That was not at the forefront of Detective Tuckerman’s mind, and was not the true reason Constable Glynn arrested and charged the accused.  
     
      
    111    It was not, however, in issue that the accused was in fact driving a vehicle in breach of the road transport legislation. The police officers were entitled to arrest him, and charge him under that legislation. Nor was it in issue that, he having been apprehended in the course of committing offences under that legislation, they were entitled to require him to submit to a breath analysis. There was, accordingly, no contravention of any Australian law. The question remains whether the exercise of the very serious power of arrest, and the consequent breath analysis amounts, in the circumstances, to an impropriety.  
     
      
    112    Having regard to all of the circumstances, I am not satisfied that there was an impropriety. It would be different if police had manufactured a false charge, or had arrested the accused purportedly for an offence which they knew he had not committed. That was not the case here. Police had good reason to believe that the accused had committed the offences charged, (ie the road transport offences) and, indeed, was in the process of continuing to commit the offences. 
     
      
    113    Further, in assessing whether there was any impropriety, it is relevant to consider the urgency of the task that police were performing. It is of some significance that surveillance police had observed the accused to be acting in a fashion that gave them reason to fear (if not believe) that, if he were the offender, there was a risk of a further, and imminent, attack or attacks. The protection of another victim, or other victims, is of no small moment in the assessment of the propriety of the conduct of the police officers.  
     
      
    114    Ordinarily such a use of the power of arrest would properly be regarded as an abuse of power and amount to a significant impropriety. Two things counterbalance what would otherwise be an inevitable conclusion. Firstly, by engaging in the conduct (driving an unregistered and uninsured vehicle) the accused exposed himself to proper arrest and detention. It is not as though police fabricated an allegation for the purpose of the arrest. Secondly, police had good reason to believe, not only that the accused was the perpetrator of seven sexual assaults, and their associated armed robberies, but also that his behaviour was such that there was a real danger that he would attack again. A further female victim was (or further female victims were) at significant risk if the perpetrator was not stopped. This is a factor of considerable importance in the evaluation of the police conduct and in the measure of censure that ought to be attached to it. 
     
      
    115    Moreover, it is relevant to consider the reliability of the evidence so obtained. The reliability of DNA evidence is, as I understand it, generally regarded as high. There was no real danger, by reason of the way in which the evidence was obtained, that its reliability would be affected. DNA is used, not only to obtain incriminatory evidence; it is capable, also, of exculpating the innocent, and it not infrequently does so. Obtaining samples of the accused’s bodily fluids for the purpose of comparison with those samples the offender had left with two of his victims was likely to do one of two things: to eliminate the accused as a suspect, or to confirm, or at least heighten, the suspicion that he was the person responsible for at least two of the attacks. 
     
      
    116    Another consideration is the degree of intrusion involved in the way the sample of bodily fluid was taken. This was, in the case of the breath analysis, minimal. 
     
      
    117    Notwithstanding my misgivings about the police use of the powers of arrest in this case, having regard to all the circumstances I am not satisfied that the evidence it yielded was improperly obtained, or obtained in consequence of an impropriety. 
     
      
    118    Even if it were otherwise, I would be satisfied that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence so obtained. My reasons for this conclusion are essentially the same as the reasons for doubting that it is evidence improperly obtained. I shall re-state them. They are: 
     
      
       
      (i) that the accused was in fact guilty of the offences under colour of which he was arrested and detained; 
       
      (ii) that police had reason to believe that, if their suspicions that the accused was the perpetrator of the assaults (or some of them) were correct, there was a danger that he would attack again;  
       
      (iii) that there was nothing in the manner in which the evidence was obtained that was likely adversely to affect its reliability; 
       
      (iv) that there was only minimal personal intrusion involved in obtaining the sample; 
       
      (v) that the evidence to be obtained was such that it was likely to confirm police suspicions and justify an arrest on the major charges, or to eliminate the accused from the enquiry. 
       
      
    119    These reasons translate readily into the matters specified as matters that must be taken into account pursuant to s 138 (3). For completeness I will express my reason in terms of that sub section, referring to those sub paragraphs that are material: 
     
      
      (a) the probative value of the evidence is extremely high; 
       
      (b) the evidence is extremely important in the proceedings; it is of critical importance in the charges involving Complainants 1 and 6. Having concluded that coincidence evidence was admissible, and that, if the jury accepted that some or all of the offences were committed by the same person, the DNA evidence incriminates the accused not only in relation to those offences, but also in relation to the offences committed upon such other of the complainants as the jury were satisfied were committed by the man who attacked one or other of those two complainants; 
       
      (c) the offences are very serious; the offences of aggravated sexual assault carry a maximum penalty of imprisonment for twenty years; 
       
      (d) to the extent that there was an impropriety (contrary to my assessment), it was, having regard to all the circumstances, not grave; 
       
      (e) while the police officers did what they did with full knowledge of their motives, they obtained advice as to the legality of their actions; 
       
      (h) given the pressure upon them, and the time constraints, it would have been difficult for police to obtain samples of the accused’s bodily fluids for DNA purposes without resort to the kind of action they took. 
       
      
    120    Counsel for the accused also argued that the obtaining of the evidence in the way police did was contrary to or inconsistent with a right recognised by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a circumstance relevant to s 138(3)(f). He referred to Article 9 of the Covenant, which precludes arbitrary arrest or detention and requires a person arrested to be informed, at the time of the arrest, of the reasons for the arrest, and to be properly informed of any charges preferred. 
     
      
    121    I do not think that the accused’s arrest on 14 July could be described as “arbitrary”. He was arrested because he was in the process of committing offences. He was informed of the reason for that arrest. The fact that the arrest had a wider purpose does not affect the fact that it was a lawful, and not an arbitrary, arrest. I am satisfied that, balancing all of the relevant factors, the desirability of admitting the evidence substantially outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence obtained by the exercise of a power of arrest for an ulterior purpose. 
     
      
    122    In my opinion, the fears police held of another attack, and the reasons for those fears, constituted an important extenuating circumstance affecting whether the behaviour should be classed as an impropriety, and if it should, the level of the impropriety, and the consequences that should attach to any such impropriety. I would be much less inclined to take a benign view of what police did and to admit the evidence, if they were not under pressure, not only to identify and apprehend a man guilty of these serious offences, but to ensure that the pattern of offences did not continue and involve additional victims. 
     
      
    123    By repeating this, I intend to dispel any notion that the view I have taken in this case amounts to an endorsement of the use of the power of arrest for an ulterior purpose or to a finding that the end justifies the means. It would be only in a most exceptional case that I would consider that the use of the power of arrest and detention for an ulterior purpose could be condoned. This is such a case. 
     
      
       
      The T-shirt 
       
      
    124    The point that was made in relation to the DNA sample obtained from the T-shirt the accused was wearing at the time of his arrest, and during the course of the execution of the search warrant at his home, was that the T-shirt was obtained, purportedly pursuant to a search warrant, but that it was not one of the eighteen items enumerated on the search warrant. It was therefore obtained either in breach of the law governing the execution of search warrants, or improperly as a result of excessive zeal in the execution of the warrant.  
     
      
    125    The evidence in this respect is not very clear. The T-shirt that the accused was wearing is described in Detective Tuckerman’s statement as “one mustard coloured JAG jeans brand ‘T-shirt’”. The search warrant nominates, inter alia, the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. one light coloured short sleeved polo shirt with horizontal stripes. 
        
       
       
        
        5. one grey coloured T-shirt with NIKE motif in blue on front. 
        
       
       
        
        6. one light coloured sweat style shirt. 
        
       
       
        
        7. one grey T-shirt with red coloured printing.” 
        
       
       
      
    126    On the voir dire Detective Tuckerman was cross-examined about this. He identified the “light coloured sweat style shirt’, item 6 in the search warrant, as conforming with the shirt the accused had been wearing. 
     
      
    127    I was in no position, on these limited descriptions, to assess whether the shirt taken from the accused, did, or might have, come within the description of item 6 sufficiently to justify its being taken pursuant to the search warrant. I was far from satisfied that it did not. 
     
      
    128    In cross-examination on the voir dire Detective Tuckerman acknowledged that consideration had been given to obtaining clothing worn by the accused for the purpose of DNA testing, and that he expected that, after the accused had been in custody at the police station for some time, interviewed, and taken to his home which was searched in his presence, it was likely that the T-shirt he had been wearing throughout these events would be impregnated with perspiration and that that would be likely to yield substances suitable for DNA testing. Detective Tuckerman maintained that the T-shirt was conceivably identifiable as one of the items listed in the search warrant and that this was at least an equal reason for its confiscation.  
     
      
    129    However, I am satisfied that the dominant reason for taking the clothing was to obtain a sample of the accused’s bodily fluids to permit DNA testing. 
     
      
    130    The basis on which counsel for the accused sought to have the evidence excluded was, again, s 138 of the Evidence Act. Again, I am not satisfied that there was an impropriety or a contravention of an Australian law, or that any evidence has been obtained in consequence of such an impropriety or contravention. The execution of the search warrant was a legitimate tool in the investigation of the sexual assaults. It was not executed for the purpose of obtaining a DNA sample from the accused, although its finding might have been manipulated to enable that to happen, and it is very unlikely that the warrant was executed in such a way as to cause some agitation to the accused, thereby making it more likely that he would perspire freely. Accordingly, the s 138 evaluation does not arise. Even it were established that the warrant did not authorise the taking of the T-shirt and that its confiscation amounted to a contravention of law, I would, again, be satisfied that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence obtained in such a fashion. 
     
      
    131    In relation to both the DNA taken from the breath test container, and the T-shirt, it is to be observed that DNA evidence was also taken from the buccal swab and that, if this is to be admitted, the relative importance of the DNA evidence from the other two items is somewhat diminished. However, in my opinion, the evidence remains, as I have observed above, important. The discretionary considerations in relation to this DNA evidence are similar to those that relate to the breath test DNA evidence. 
     
      
       
      The buccal swab. 
       
      
    132    S 353A (2) of the Crimes Act provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “When a person is in lawful custody upon a charge of committing any crime or offence which is of such a nature and is alleged to have been committed under such circumstances that there are reasonable grounds for believing that an examination of his or her person will afford evidence as to the commission of the crime or offence, any legally qualified medical practitioner acting at the request of any officer of police of or above the rank of sergeant, and any person acting in good faith in his or her aid and under his or her direction, may make such an examination of the person so in custody as is reasonable in order to ascertain the facts which may afford such evidence.” 
        
       
      
    133    The advice, or the interpretation of s 353A(2) given to the accused by police officers on 31 July and 1 August, was a correct interpretation of this sub section. The section is designed to permit the taking of body samples such as saliva or blood for the purpose, inter alia, of DNA testing. At the time the buccal swab was taken the accused was in custody; and he was in custody upon a charge of committing a crime of such a nature and alleged to have been committed under such circumstances that reasonable grounds existed for believing that examination of his person would afford evidence as to the commission of the crime. 
     
      
    134    Prima facie, therefore, the sub section authorised the taking of the sample. 
     
      
    135    However, the argument that was put on behalf of the accused was that he came to be in custody solely as a result of the taking of the previous samples of bodily fluid which was, on the argument put on behalf of the accused, improper or unlawful. Counsel for the accused asserted, in effect, a different but related claim of impropriety. 
     
      
    136    It is obvious that the accused’s argument in relation to the buccal swabs depends upon a finding that both of the previous samples were improperly or illegally taken. Given the conclusions I have reached and expressed in relation to those matters, there is little left of this argument. 
     
      
    137    However, I would add that, even if I were wrong on all counts in relation to those matters, it would not affect my view that the buccal swab was taken lawfully in the exercise of the power conferred by s 353A(2). The accused was in lawful custody on a relevant charge at that time. Even if the arrest had been effected in reliance upon improperly or illegally obtained evidence, or evidence which would later prove to be inadmissible or rejected in the exercise of discretion, that did not affect the legality of his arrest. Accordingly, there is no place for the exercise of the s 138 evaluation. There is no impropriety or illegality in the taking of the buccal swab. 
     
      
    138    As I have earlier mentioned, the consequence of this conclusion is that the importance of the earlier DNA evidence is somewhat diminished, but not to the point at which a reconsideration of the views earlier expressed results in any alteration on modification of those views. 
     
      
    139    In considering the matters raised in relation to all matters, but, particularly, the DNA evidence, I have not overlooked the decisions of the High Court in R v Swaffield; R v Pavic [1998] HCA 1; 192 CLR 159. In those cases the High Court considered at length the exercise of “the fairness discretion” in the admission of evidence of confessional material (which is strictly admissible but subject to discretionary exclusion) in criminal trials. Although those decisions were concerned with confessional evidence, the principles stated are not, in my view limited to evidence of that kind, but have potential application to any evidence obtained in such circumstances that its fairness is questionable. Both appeals, however, emanated from jurisdictions other than NSW, and were not therefore governed by the precise provisions now contained in the Evidence Act. The decisions must be read in the light of the Evidence Act, but are of obvious materiality in providing guidance in the exercise of the various discretions based upon fairness (however expressed) contained in that Act. Indeed, in the majority judgment, Toohey, Gaudron and Gummow JJ referred to the NSW Evidence Act ([68]). Parallel with, and perhaps overlapping with, the fairness discretion is what Brennan CJ called “the public policy discretion”. I have considered whether there is anything in the reasoning in Swaffield and Pavic that should alter the view I have taken. I am satisfied that, even applying the broader approach set out in those cases, there was nothing in the manner in which the evidence was obtained that would require its exclusion either in terms of fairness, or for public policy reasons.  
     
      
    140    I ruled that all evidence relating to DNA testing would be admitted. 
     
      
       
      3 Picture identification 
       
      
    141    The accused sought the exclusion of identification of the accused made by complainants 4, 5 and 7 from photographs. It will be necessary to set out the circumstances in which the identifications were made.  
     
      
    142    As has been set out above the accused was arrested by Constable Glynn at about 8.40 pm on 14 July 2000. So far as I can ascertain from the statements, he remained in custody in relation to those charges until about 9.15 pm. He was then taken to an interview room where he was introduced to Detectives Tuckerman and Cox. Detective Tuckerman told the accused that they were making enquiries into a number of sexual assaults and robberies. In my view, at this time the accused was under arrest in relation to the sexual assaults and robberies. The purpose of the arrest and consequent detention was to enable the officers of Strike Force Sapelo to investigate his involvement in the commission of those offences. The statutory authority for such detention is to be found in Part 10A of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
    143    The accused remained in that custody until 4.00 am the following morning, 15 July.  
     
      
    144    At about 1.00 am on 15 July, at the request of police, Complainant 7 attended at the Parramatta Police Station where she participated in what has been called photograph identification. Complainant 7 was shown fourteen photographs, which included a photograph of the accused, and was invited to identify any of the photographs she recognised as a photograph of the person who had committed the assault upon her. She selected the photograph of the accused. The entire process was recorded on video tape.  
     
      
    145    At about 2.30 am Detective Krawczyk and Constable Shepherd went to the home of Complainant 5. They were in possession of the same fourteen photographs and went through the same process with Complainant 5. She also selected the photograph of the accused. This process also was recorded on video tape.  
     
      
    146    In each case the photograph of the accused used was one taken from police records, have come into existence as the result of an earlier arrest of the accused. It was the most recent photograph in the possession of police. 
     
      
    147    On 27 July 2000 Complainant 4 went to the Parramatta Police Station. After dealing with some other matters, to which reference will be made below, she also was shown the fourteen photographs and also selected the photograph of the accused. This process also was recorded on video tape. 
     
      
    148    Having regard to the challenge to this evidence, it will be necessary shortly to refer in some more detail to what appears on the video tape. 
     
      
    149    The first challenge, however, to the evidence concerned s 115 of the Evidence Act which is concerned with what is called “picture identification evidence”. The evidence under consideration is evidence of that kind, within the definition contained in sub s (1). Sub ss(3), (4) and (5) are material. They provide as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (3) 
         Subject to subsection (4), picture identification evidence adduced by the prosecutor is not admissible if:  
         
        (a) when the pictures were examined, the defendant was in the custody of a police officer of the police force investigating the commission of the offence with which the defendant has been charged, and  
         
        (b) the picture of the defendant that was examined was made before the defendant was taken into that police custody.  
         
         
        (4) 
         Subsection (3) does not apply if:  
         
        (a) the defendant's appearance had changed significantly between the time when the offence was committed and the time when the defendant was taken into that custody, or  
         
        (b) it was not reasonably practicable to make a picture of the defendant after the defendant was taken into that custody.  
         
         
        (5) 
         Picture identification evidence adduced by the prosecutor is not admissible if, when the pictures were examined, the defendant was in the custody of a police officer of the police force investigating the commission of the offence with which the defendant has been charged, unless:  
         
        (a) the defendant refused to take part in an identification parade, or  
         
        (b) the defendant's appearance had changed significantly between the time when the offence was committed and the time when the defendant was taken into that custody, or  
         
        (c) it would not have been reasonable to have held an identification parade that included the defendant.  
        
       
       
      Sub s (3) prima facie precludes the admission of picture identification evidence adduced by the Crown if, at the time the identification process took place, the person accused was in the custody of an officer of the police force investigating the commission of the offence charged and the photograph of the accused contained in the array of photographs shown to the witness or witnesses was made before the accused was taken into that custody. Those circumstances apply here. The photograph of the accused that was used was a photograph in the possession of police and taken before his arrest on 14 July. As he was in custody at the time Complainants 5 and 7 examined the photographs, prima facie sub s (3) renders evidence of that identification inadmissible. 
       
      
    150    However, sub s (4) provides two exceptions, one only of which is presently relevant. That is the exception provided in sub para (b). Detective Tuckerman gave an explanation for using that photograph of the accused. He said that he chose it out of fairness to the accused, it being the most recent photograph of him in the possession of police. 
     
      
    151    In my opinion it is clear that Detective Tuckerman was, in part, acting under a misapprehension as to his powers. In evidence he said that he did not believe that he had the power or authority to take a photograph of the accused without the accused’s consent. In my opinion that is an incorrect understanding of the relevant provisions of the Crimes Act. S353A(3) provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “(3) When a person is in lawful custody for any offence punishable on indictment or summary conviction, the officer in charge of police at the station where the person is so in custody may take or cause to be taken all such particulars as may be deemed necessary for the identification of such person, including, where the person is of or above the age of fourteen years, the person’s photograph and fingerprints and palm prints.” 
        
       
      
    152    In my opinion it is quite plain that the accused was, from about 9.15 pm, on 14 July, “in lawful custody for [offences] punishable on indictment” those offences being the various offences of sexual assault and robbery and kidnapping. The subsection therefore authorised the taking of a photograph. That photograph could be used for the purposes of identification in the way the photographs were in fact used: R v McPhail and Tivey (1988) 36 A Crim R 390. The plain words of sub s (3) require this interpretation. In case there is any doubt (as was expressed by the Crown during the course of argument) the opening words of sub s (3) are to be contrasted with the opening words of the preceding sub sections. Sub ss (1) and (2) both open with the words:  
     
      
       
        
        “Where a person is in lawful custody  
        upon a charge 
          
         committing any crime or offence …” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    153    Sub s (3) envisages custody without charge as contemplated by Part 10A. I am therefore satisfied that the view of the law taken by Detective Tuckerman was erroneous and that he had the power to take a photograph of the accused with or without his consent. 
     
      
    154    However, that does not dispose of s 115(3). The exception provided in sub s (4) (b) focuses upon the reasonable practicability of photo-graphing the accused after he has been taken into custody. In evidence Detective Tuckerman referred to a number of matters that made it plain that it was not reasonably practicable to do so within the time available. Firstly, Detective Tuckerman was engaged at a police station which was not his normal place of work. He was, of course, aware that police stations are equipped with facilities for the taking of photographs. However, he was of the opinion that, the photographic examinations having commenced at about 1.30 am, it would not have been reasonably practicable to have a photograph taken of the accused and processed in order to enable the identifications to proceed. In the witness box he gave consideration to the possibility that an instant print Polaroid type camera might have been available in the police station, but pointed out that such cameras produce a photograph with a different appearance from those ordinarily held by police. If a Polaroid photograph of the accused were to have been taken, and photographs already in possession of police used to complete the array, the prejudice to the accused by reason of the inevitable attention given to the one photograph that was different is manifest. That would have made it necessary, as Detective Tuckerman pointed out, to make up an array of photographs of other men of similar age, colouring, and facial characteristics all taken on the Polaroid camera; and this during the early hours of the morning. In any event, there is no reason to believe that a Polaroid camera was available. 
     
      
    155    I accepted that, in the circumstances, it was not reasonably practicable to “make a picture” of the accused after he was taken into custody. 
     
      
    156    Two matters that were put on behalf of the accused should be mentioned. Firstly, counsel suggested that the impracticability of photographing the accused was not in Detective Tuckerman’s mind and was not, in truth, the reason or even a reason for the course that he adopted. This may well be true, and indeed I thought that it probably was. His misunderstanding of his right to take a photograph established, to my satisfaction that he did not turn his mind to the reasonable practicability of taking a photograph of the accused. But sub s (4)(b) is not directed to the motivation or state of mind of the police officer; it is directed to the objective reasonable practicability or otherwise of taking a photograph. Whether Detective Tuckerman thought about it at the time or not, it was not reasonably practicable to take a photograph of the accused - at least one that could be used for photographic identification purposes at that time. 
     
      
    157    Secondly, it was argued that there was no real necessity for the urgency which Detective Tuckerman perceived, and that the photographic identification could have been delayed until it was possible to take a photograph that conformed with the prima facie requirement of s 115. The simple answer to this proposition is that s 115 does not require or contemplate deferring the examination until a photograph can be made available.  
     
      
    158    Further, I was satisfied, (contrary to the submissions) that there was a degree of urgency associated with the photographic identification of the accused. He was, at that time, in custody pursuant to Part 10A, and this afforded police limited time for their investigations. In order to have sufficient evidence to justify charging the accused (or to eliminate him from the enquiry) it was necessary for police to conduct the identification investigations with expedition. 
     
      
    159    Sub s(5) does not operate to exclude the evidence because the accused refused, when asked, to take part in an identification parade. 
     
      
    160    I was therefore satisfied that there is no reason associated with the provisions of s 115 not to admit the evidence of photographic identification.  
     
      
    161    I pause here to note that these considerations do not apply in the case of Complainant 4, who examined the photographs on 27 July, a time when the accused was not in police custody. 
     
      
    162    The next argument advanced on behalf of the accused in relation to the photographic identification evidence was made in reliance on the discretions conferred by ss 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act. In each case the argument focused upon the probative value of the evidence. Put shortly, it was suggested that close examination of the video of the photographic examination would disclose unfairness in the conduct of the police officers who provided the photographs to the complainants. The suggestion was that by subtle hints or gestures the police officers influenced the selection of the photographs of the accused. 
     
      
    163    I have viewed each video tape. Indeed, during the course of the voir dire, counsel for the accused, with the use of the remote control device of the video machine, played and re-played those portions of the videos on which he relied to suggest influence of the kind he claimed had taken place. I was quite unable to detect any such influence. In my opinion each identification was conducted with scrupulous fairness on the part of the police officers concerned. I do not propose to deal in detail with the contents of each video tape. I do note that the voices on the video tape are at times extremely indistinct. However, counsel having viewed the videos on even more occasions than I have, pointed specifically to those parts of the video which were said to be evidence of unfairness of the kind asserted. In no case did I accept that there was such unfairness. 
     
      
    164    I proposed to admit the evidence of photographic identification. 
     
      
       
      4 Voice identification evidence 
       
      
    165    As part of the identification police officers undertook a rather unusual (at least in my experience) voice identification exercise. The accused’s voice had been recorded when he was interviewed on 14 July. Police extracted a portion of that interview and deleted some parts of the extract in order to produce a reasonably free flowing recording of the accused’s voice. They were careful to select a portion that did not give rise to any assumptions about the accused. 
     
      
    166    They then prepared a script in identical terms and sought the assistance of eleven men they spoke to in the Parramatta Mall. Each of the eleven men returned to the Parramatta Police Station and read the script. Each reading was recorded on the same equipment as had been used earlier to record the accused’s voice. The result was that police had in their possession twelve tape recordings, each of a male voice, each using identical words, and each recorded on identical equipment. The aim of this exercise was to create a voice identification process parallel, so far as possible, with an identification parade, or photograph identification.  
     
      
    167    Each recording was then played to each complainant, and each was asked, in a manner analogous to the photograph identification, to say whether she recognised the voice of the man who had attacked her. In each case the process was recorded on video tape. The accused’s voice was the voice recorded on the tape numbered 12, although the tapes were not necessarily played to the complainants in numerical sequence. Complainant 1 selected two voices, one of which was the voice of the accused. Complainant 3 similarly selected two voices, one of which was that of the accused. Complainant 4 selected only the voice of the accused and expressed herself as “very positive” that this voice was similar to that of her attacker and that it had been familiar to her when she first heard the tape recording. She added that when the tape was first played to her she “became uneasy and [her] heart started racing”, and that none of the other tapes had had that effect upon her. Complainant 6 selected three tape recordings, one of which contained the voice of the accused. She was unable to say with any certainty that any of these voices was the voice of her attacker but said that each was similar. Complainant 7 identified only the voice of the accused and expressed herself as “positive that this male’s voice was very similar to the male” who had assaulted her. She also said that after hearing the voice she became very upset.  
     
      
    168    Criticisms of a similar kind to those made in relation to the photographic identification were made of the voice identifications were made of the voice identification process. The criticisms were directed to challenging the probative value of the evidence so obtained. There were, potentially, some defects in the process. The most glaring of these was that the recording of the accused was a recording of him using words of his own selection, in a natural fashion, and therefore having the rhythm and cadence of ordinary speech. The recordings of some, at least, of the other men lack that natural rhythm and are discernibly recordings of men reading the script rather than speaking naturally. Further, despite the precautions taken by police in using the same equipment, the quality of the recording of the accused’s voice is different from the quality of the other recordings. In other words, the recording of the accused’s voice has some features which distinguish it from the recordings of the others.  
     
      
    169    I regarded these deficiencies as minor, When I use the word “deficiencies” I do not intend to express any criticism of the police officers. Such deficiencies as there were were brought about by the exigencies of the circumstances and could not, in my view, have been avoided. Moreover, they are, as I have said, minor. The tape recording of the accused’s voice does have a different quality and sound to the tape recording of the other voices; and the men who read from the script provided to them, in some cases at least, did not do so very convincingly. However, the whole process was video taped, and one thing that emerges from the video tapes is the close and careful attention each complainant paid to each of the tape recordings. Most listened to at least some of the recordings a number times and went through a process of elimination. Only two of the complainants whose voice identification evidence is in issue chose the accused’s voice alone; each of the others also selected at least one other voice. This did not suggest to me that the complainants were directed intentionally or unintentionally to the accused’s voice. 
     
      
    170    As with the photographic identification, the video recording in each case provides cause for confidence that the process was undertaken with scrupulous fairness. Specific points were made about the identification by different complainants and it was suggested that, in different cases, the police officer conducting the exercise gave subtle hints which influences the selection. Such is not the impression I received.  
     
      
    171    The challenge to this evidence was made in reliance upon the discretionary provisions of ss 135 and 137. Again, what was challenged was the “probative value” of the evidence. In my opinion the argument proceeded on a misapprehension of the concept of “probative value” as used in those sections. 
     
      
    172    In my opinion those sections were not intended to substitute the opinion of a judge for the evaluation of the jury as to the credibility or the weight of the evidence. Rather, the words “probative value” in those sections is generally, intended to refer to the extent to which the challenged evidence, if accepted as credible, would affect the strength (or otherwise) of the Crown case. In other words, “probative value” in those sections is a reference to the importance of the evidence relative to other pieces of evidence in the Crown case. 
     
      
    173    In my opinion the evidence of the five complainants is of significant probative value (assuming the jury accept it as credible); of course, the probative value is greater according to the degree of certainty expressed by any particular complainant, and greater again where only one voice has been nominated. 
     
      
    174    I ruled that the voice identification evidence would be admitted. 
     
      
       
      5 Object identification 
       
      
    175    This concerns the process undertaken by which each of the complainants was invited to view an array of clothing, and an array of knives and screw drivers, and to nominate any of those items she recognised as having been worn or used by her attacker. It is unnecessary to detail the specific results of this process. It was, like the other investigative procedures, fully recorded on video tape. In some cases complainants, with varying degrees of certainty or hesitation, selected items of clothing as similar to items of clothing worn by their assailants; and in some cases individual complainants selected knives or a screw driver as being similar to those used by their assailants. 
     
      
    176    In relation to the knives on display, and, indeed, the screw drivers, it may be observed that they are patently very ordinary household items, which would be likely to be found in virtually any household in the country. 
     
      
    177    Similarly, the clothing array, though extensive, is relatively unremarkable. It consists of a number of jackets, shirts and T-shirts and pairs of shorts.  
     
      
    178    There is one feature which limits the value of the evidence obtained in this way. All of the clothing was clothing taken from the accused’s home following the execution of the search warrant. All of the knives and screw drivers were taken from the accused’s home at the same time. In other words, whatever items were identified by the complainants, they were items which belonged to the accused. The evidence, therefore, does not have decisive value as fixing the accused with responsibility for any attack, as it would have done, if, for example, amongst an array of clothing and implements taken from a combination of sources other than the accused, a complainant had positively identified his clothing or implements. 
     
      
    179    But, in my opinion, the evidence potentially has some (although limited) probative value. The weight to be assigned to it is, of course, a matter for the jury. 
     
      
    180    I proposed to admit the evidence of object identification.

      REGINA v. WILLIAM ERNEST HALL 
       
      REGINA v. DONNA ANN SMITH 
       
      REGINA v. GEORGE WILLIAM GARDENER 
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: On Monday 17 September 2001, I determined an objection to evidence the Crown proposed to present at a trial listed to proceed that day, ruling that the tender of the evidence should be rejected at that time. I published my reasons ex tempore. The following is the revised expression of those reasons. 
    2   Three accused have been charged with various offences and are before me on an application for directions in respect of the trial, which it was expected, would begin last week. Due to a matter affecting my personal health it has not been possible to proceed as quickly with the matter as might otherwise have been the case. 
    3   During the directions hearings application was made by the three counsel for the accused for me to exclude, on a pre-trial ruling, certain evidence it was intended the Crown would tender against all. That evidence comprised lawfully made recordings of intercepted conversations said to be between the three accused. 
    4   All accused object to the evidence on the basis that the recordings are of insufficient clarity to enable a jury to determine what is being said in sufficient context as to allow the necessary inference to be drawn of the true meaning of what was said or who said it. 
    5   The indictment charges the accused William Ernest Hall with the murder of a security guard at Darling Harbour in the state of New South Wales on 2 November 1992, and robbery in company of certain property by way of cash and revolvers of Armaguard on that occasion and at that place. The co-accused are each charged with one count of accessory after the fact to each of the offences alleged against the accused Hall. 
    6   The Crown had intimated an intent to present a fresh indictment, intending not to proceed with the indictment on which the accused has currently been brought before the court, on the basis that the fresh indictment would be presented. 
    7   However, as the application to exclude the evidence has proceeded, with the Crown's consent, on a preliminary basis, I was informed by the learned Crown Prosecutor that in the event that I were to rule that the evidence he wishes to tender should not be admitted, it would be the Crown's position that it would no bill the matter on the present indictment. That is to say, that he would enter a nolle prosequi on that indictment with no intent to present a fresh indictment on the evidence presently notified. Such a nolle prosequi would be entered in relation to the condition of the evidence for the prosecution as it will stand in the absence of the challenged evidence. 
    8   I am shortly informed that the other evidence would simply be the evidence of various persons who saw the robbery or portions thereof and the evidence of a witness who might be able to explain the family relationships between the three accused and others. It is accepted by the Crown, and indeed it is patent from what I have said, that that evidence would leave the case in a condition such as would not be sufficient to sustain a prosecution of Hall.  
    9   I turn then to the evidence in respect of which the application for exclusion is made. That evidence consists, so I am told, of a number of conversations between various of the accused or all three of them, all lawfully recorded, which conversations are said, in the case of the accused Hall, to amount to implicit admissions of his involvement in some way which cannot, the Crown accepts, be precisely specified, in the robbery and hence the killing; and which, on the part of the co-accused, amount to implicit acts of assistance which comprise some but not all of the acts of assistance on which the Crown relied, but, importantly, which acts are said to disclose the knowledge on their part of the offence committed by the co-accused Hall. It is accepted that in the event that this evidence is excluded there will be insufficient evidence of Hall’s crime or to show a case against him or to disclose knowledge of the offence, so as to make a case against the others, even if there were sufficient evidence to disclose an intent to assist the accused Hall to avoid justice in some unspecified way. In all three cases, the Crown accepts that the challenged material would, at the highest, considered in the context of the other evidence the Crown would tender, afford a basis for inferences of conduct said by the Crown to amount to admissions from which the inferences of guilt in each case could be drawn. 
    10   For the purpose of determining this application the Crown has provided me with a facts sheet setting out the general background. That facts sheet will be marked Exhibit A. In addition I have been provided with a chronology. That chronology will be marked Exhibit B. 
    11   Further, the Crown has provided me with what it has described as a transcript. It is headed, ""tape recorded evidence, evidence of statements of admission, statements of implied admissions, and admissions inferred from conduct"". That document will be marked Exhibit C. It is probably best to be regarded as a factual submission by the Crown. That is to say a submission of what the Crown says should be extracted from what is recorded, and being those facts the Crown says a jury might properly find from listening to the compact disks on which have been recorded the conversations on which the Crown relies. 
    12   There have been a number of such conversations. It is common ground that those conversations were induced by a police investigative technique of releasing information to the press so that press articles, to which I was referred, would be published which would arouse at least the interest, if not the apprehension, of the accused, such as to induce them to speak about the matters now, even though those matters are almost 10 years old, and to speak in such a way such as might produce admissions of the kind I have referred to in circumstances where what was said might lawfully be recorded. 
    13   Further, two persons, Dorothy Clark and Wayne Clark, were taken into police custody. In the case of Wayne Clark, the application has proceeded on the basis he was taken into custody for an involvement in the very murder with which Hall is charged. Dorothy Clark was taken into custody for an involvement in assisting him after the fact. 
    14   Further, of the three accused themselves, Gardener was apparently taken into custody by way of the execution of some warrants for extraneous matters and whilst taken into custody was apparently spoken to by the police concerning Hall's involvement in these events. 
    15   It was expected the accused would learn of those arrests and that conversation and that this would also induce them to speak about the crimes in such a way as to enable lawful recording. 
    16   These matters set the context for what appears, so I am told, in the conversations that were recorded. Tendered to me have been CDs on which are recorded, so I am told, the conversations the content of which it is said is also set out in transcripts which have been provided to me with each CD. Those transcripts are said to contain what can be derived from the sounds on those CDs in respect of master tapes. Of those conversations I am told that two in particular are of critical significance. These are recorded on master tapes 107 and 109 I am told. Each CD will be marked: 107 - Exhibit D; 109 - Exhibit E. The corresponding transcripts will be marked Exhibits F and G respectively. 
    17   As the application has been argued the initial ground taken was that the recording of the crucial portions, at least, of the conversations on which the Crown relied, was of such poor quality that all that could be detected, even if anything understandable could be detected, was, when considered in context, entirely unreliable so as not to afford any sufficient foundation, in the case of Hall, for inferring admissions and in the case of the co-accused for detecting oral acts such as might constitute harbouring or assisting with the requisite state of knowledge. 
    18   In addition, other submissions were made as to various discretionary bases for exclusion. Indeed it was submitted that much or all of the material was irrelevant in the sense of the concept of relevance used in the Evidence Act 1995, s.55. The submission was that the material or the crucial portions of it was either completely incomprehensible or the immediate context was incomprehensible so that the inference of the true meaning of what could be heard could not be reliably drawn. It was submitted that the material could not be categorised as evidence which if accepted could rationally affect, directly or indirectly, on its own or in combination with other evidence, the assessment by the tribunal of fact of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceedings. 
    19   Specific submissions, however, were made as to portions of tape 107. The Crown submits that on a proper listening the following will be heard in an exchange between Gardener and Hall:-  
     
      
       
       ""Gardener: Mate, they want you bad... 
       
      
       
      
       
       Hall: ... Pinch me on... I know they're going to do it eventually ... 
       
      
       
      
       
       Gardener: Your cousin, I'm afraid to say it, must've said something to somebody in the boob, he fuckin' must've cause you do not jump out of the fuckin' woodwork after eight years and go this fuckin' heavy. Your cousin has told someone that he trusts something and there's no exchange from this if you're there, you're in, don't matter whether you fuckin' drove the car or you fuckin' didn't know it was gonna happen. Don't matter. I gotta get you somewhere mate. Fuckin' hell, you certainly can't use your own and you can't use that other one cause you haven't authenticated it yet have you? 
       
      
       
      
       
       Hall: ... (Something indistinct)..."" 
       
      
     20   During argument the question arose of whether Mr. Gardener's bush lawyerish advice should be excluded on the basis that it was prejudicial to Hall, the Crown's contention being that Hall was guilty of the murder, if at all, by reason of the application of the doctrines of murder felony or common purpose. The Crown contended, it being unable to show he was the principal in the first degree to which the Crimes Act 1900, s.18 definition of murder felony might apply, he might nonetheless be an ""accomplice with him"", with the principal or be complicitous in the murder in the manner described by the High Court in Johns v. The Queen (1980) 143 CLR 108. The Crown submitted to me that if Hall was involved in the robbery, and was aware that loaded guns were to be used, that supplied a sufficient basis for his liability for murder. 
    21   It will readily become apparent that the passage of the transcript I have set out describes a wider basis of liability than that for which the Crown contends when Gardener says to Hall, ""If you're there, you're in. Don't matter whether you fucking drove the car or you fucking didn't know it was gonna happen. Don't matter."" On my view of it, the context of that passage is not adopted by Hall. 
    22   There is nothing that would enable that statement of Gardener's to have, in my view, any further significance, except as going to increase Hall's apprehensions, whether or not he had some involvement before the fact, after the fact, or at the fact of the robbery, even if he did not ""know it was gonna happen"", whatever that may mean. In that context the phrase may refer to a robbery, a robbery in company, an armed robbery, or the killing. 
    23   It is of interest that Gardener refers specifically to the driving of the car as one of the possibilities. The evidence with which the Crown has provided me includes a summary account of the eyewitness’s statements, marked Exhibit H. Those statements refer to at least three persons being involved, one being the driver and two being the actual assailants who apparently left the car with revolvers and cold-bloodedly killed the security officer in the process of robbing the van.  
    24   There is, however, contained in the statements reference also to another vehicle, and it is not possible in my view, on what I have seen in the summaries, to establish beyond reasonable doubt that there were only three participants in the robbery. Thus the evidence would seem to leave open others having some involvement or role which would not necessitate such knowledge as would be required for complicity in the common purpose or felony murder and in the latter case, the foundational felony. The alternative counts in the indictment apparently attempt to accommodate this difficulty. But Hall's role, if any, remains, at the least, vague. 
    25   It will be apparent from what I have said that the passage to which I have referred is not a secure foundation for an inference of an admission of guilt. It might be treated as evidence of the provision of erroneous information which might produce an effect which would tend to detract from the reliability of drawing inferences of guilt based on Hall's subsequent conduct. It might make it more difficult to attribute the incriminating significance to such of his utterances or acts as are asserted to evidence a consciousness of guilt of the crime of murder or, indeed, the form of robbery charged. In my view, since the statement is not adopted it does not constitute any admission by Hall, nor in these circumstances can his subsequent conduct amount to implicit admissions by him which should be allowed into evidence against him. It is plainly prejudicial. I therefore reject that portion of the material tendered. 
    26   In passing, and before turning to the more general issue, I note that at the commencement of master tape 107, following the sound of dogs barking, and I think probably following the sound of a cockatoo screeching, or so I am informed the relevant noise is, is the reference to the name of a person. There is some disagreement at the bar table as to what that name was. It is recorded in the transcript as Greg James, my own name. It is common ground that I am not the person referred to. Further, it is common ground that the transcription is, at least, at this point incorrect and that what was recorded was a different name from that which appears in the transcript. The reference could only operate, were the material to be admitted, to confuse and mislead the jury. I reject that portion of the material particularly since in the context it is entirely extraneous to the subject matter of what the Crown seeks to prove in furtherance of its case on the charges. 
    27   I then turn to the general objection. In the case of Hall, there is a specific argument that it is not reasonably open to find that what is said to be said by him amounts to admissions or could be reliably held to be said by him. The argument relied on s.88 of the Evidence Act 1995. That section provides that:- 
     
      
       
       ""For the purpose of determining whether evidence of an admission is admissible, the court is to find that a particular person made the admission if it is reasonably open to find that he or she made the admission."" 
       
      
    28   The nature of the test to determine what it is reasonably open to find has not been authoritatively explained in the case law to this point. In my view, the section deals both with the identify of the person said to be making the admission and whether what is done is an admission. The Crown Prosecutor contends that evidence is admissible as an admission, ie., a previous adverse representation and must be put before a jury in the event that it is an utterance or act such that the jury might attribute it to the accused and might give it content by way of treating it as the foundation for an inference which might advance the prosecution case, ie., rationally affect a matter in issue, even if the trial judge cannot determine that it would have that content or be so attributable. It is submitted that I can only rely on my own natural senses to ascertain what was said and by whom and that the natural senses of 12 jurors may well exceed the capabilities of those of a trial judge so that if they might detect that which I cannot, the evidence should be left to them. 
    29   Were the test not whether ""it is reasonably open"" but whether ""it might be possible"", there would be much to be said for that submission. The section speaks of the court making a finding. That finding could only be made on the basis of what appears to the court to “be reasonably open” rather than some conjecture as to what others might perceive. A trial judge can only determine whether evidence has the capability of rationally affecting a matter in issue by application of his or her own senses.  
    30   I turn to consider the material. There has been played to me in court, Exhibit D – tape 107, one of the relevant CDs which I have listened to with the assistance of headphones specially provided, having been informed that the quality of the recording has been specially enhanced. It was accepted I could regard that tape as fairly reflecting the clarify of all material in the Crown case. By consent, previously I had in chambers listened to the CDs of tapes 107 and 109 with the assistance of the transcript, using a commercial CD player and speaker system. I have attempted, when I did that, to follow the transcript. Today, when listening to tape 107, I have attempted to follow the sound without the assistance of the transcript. In that regard I have questioned the Crown as to what other evidence it might seek to present which might enable the ascertainment of the content of what is contained in the CD recordings to enable one to know what was said and by whom. 
    31   I have been informed that it was intended to call police officers to give evidence identifying who participated in the conversation and how. Further, that those officers would seek to identify, from what is heard on the compact disks, the content of what was said by reference to the transcripts which they had produced after listening to the records of conversations. I asked the Crown whether it was intended to provide that evidence by way of expert testimony. I was told no. I asked whether any hearsay notice had been given. I was told no. I was told that the transcript was only to be used as an aide memoire, not as a statement itself of the content of the conversations. 
    32   I now turn to the question of whether the transcript might be used for the purpose of giving content to what the sounds on the CDs. I invited the Crown on a number of occasions to inform me of what additional evidence the Crown might call to assist on the question of ascertaining what the content might be and as to how the transcript might be used. It comes down, as I understand the Crown's position, to an inability on the Crown's part to provide the transcript as other than an aide memoire. That is, a reminder to the jurors of what they heard for themselves rather than some summary or expert evidence which would assist them to determine the content. The distinction was explained by the High Court in Butera v. DPP (1987) 164 CLR 180, a pre-Evidence Act 1995 decision. 
    33   The Crown did not refer in this regard to s.48(1)(c) of the Evidence Act 1995 and by limiting the potential use of the transcript appears to have disclaimed any reliance on the transcript as an independent source of content. 
    34   Section 48(1)(c) provides as follows:- 
     
      
       
       ""If the document in question is an article or thing by which words are recorded in such a way as to be capable of being reproduced as sound, or in which words are recorded in a code (including shorthand writing) - tendering a document that is or purports to be a transcript of the words."" 
       
      
    35   The better view seems to be that that provision would not in these circumstances assist the Crown to make the transcript admissible for the truth and accuracy of its content or as evidence of what was in fact said without more: Eastman v. The Queen (1997) 158 ALR 107 at 202; Regina v. Cassar & Sleiman (No. 17) [1999] NSWSC 436 at paragraph 7 (Sperling, J.). Any tender of the transcript as an independent unverifiable source of the asserted statements would almost certainly lead to rejection even if s.48(1)(c) contemplated this. It would seem from the inclusion of the section in Chapter 2 of the Act, a part which deals with modes of proof rather than in Chapter 3 which deals with the rules of admissibility of content that the section would not have this effect. I conclude the transcript is not independent of other evidence to be admitted. 
    36   As far as the evidence of the police officers concerning the content of the conversations is concerned, I drew the attention of all parties to the decision of the High Court in Smith v. The Queen [2001] HCA 50 concerning visual identification evidence. The Crown sought to distinguish that decision and the reasoning of the majority, as well as the reasoning of Kirby, J., on the ground that that decision was concerned with photo identification evidence and the testimony of persons who, from photographs and prior acquaintanceship, sought to make an identification of an accused person.  
    37   Here, the Crown conceded that the police officers sought to make the aural identification from listening to the tapes and some prior acquaintanceship, the extent of which was not specified, with the voices of one or more of the accused. 
    38   In that decision the majority held that the of identification evidence was irrelevant and inadmissible for that reason as being an attempt to avoid the restrictions on the giving of expert evidence under the Evidence Act 1995. Kirby, J. was prepared to accept the relevance and admissibility of the evidence but was of the view that such evidence would, except in the most extraordinary circumstances, be rejected in discretion. He pointed out that there is no bright line between fact and expert opinion; one merges with the other by degrees. 
    39   I have a similar problem in the present matter to that with which the High Court dealt. I consider I cannot simply substitute the views of the police officers as expressed in the transcript for my own appreciation of what might have been said or who spoke. Nor can I assume that because the officers assert the transcript reflects what they heard, the transcript should be used to give that content to the sounds. They are not experts nor can I hear nor conclude that a jury could hear on the CDS what is on the transcript. In this case, to use the transcript as an aide while listening would be likely to have the effect of allowing the police officers’ views to so affect what is discerned as to substitute their views of the content for what would be independently appreciated as the content. It may be that the police officers have, after many repetitions, reached the opinion that the content is as set out in the transcript. I simply have no information as to whether a jury might feasibly attempt to test or reproduce what they did to reach that result. I consider the officers’ opinions are inadmissible and I would reject the use of the transcript because of the danger of its accuracy being untestable. 
    40   I proceed on the basis that if I consider there is sufficient clarity in what is recorded that the jury listening to the recordings could hold that the content of what was said and the identity of the author of the statement was generally as attributed in Exhibit C, then the objection should be overruled, but that, unless the jurors were able to detect that without speculation the material should be rejected. 
    41   For my own part when I come to hear the material unaided by the transcript I cannot on many occasions distinguish between the voices that are recorded. Insofar as I can, in the case of Mrs. Smith I am almost entirely unable to make out the content of what she is saying. In the case of Mr. Hall, I am better able to detect the voice but I am almost unable to detect the content of the various passages. I am able to detect the voice and the content in many of the passages in which Mr. Gardener speaks. Mr. Gardener seems to speak considerably more than the others. 
    42   Those matters I am able to detect of what Mr. Gardener says plainly go to Mr. Gardener's concern at Mr. Hall being apprehended for some involvement in the robbery, or at least in a robbery or robberies or some criminality connected with what has been said to have been said to police by Clark when Clark was arrested, or in respect of what he, Gardener, was told by police concerning what is probably the robbery in question when he, Gardener, was apprehended. 
    43   As far as the position of Smith and Gardener are concerned it is at least clear as I have said that Gardener is concerned to protect Hall against apprehension for something involved in connection with what had been said to police and by police probably about the robbery. I am not however satisfied, either when I come to consider what I hear as said by Gardener, or when I come to consider the general context so that I might attempt to derive from what is heard on the tape, content, having added the effect of that context to what little I can hear, that there is material which would enable one to ascertain what role if any in the robbery, or in connection with the robbery, Gardener might think Hall performed. I am utterly unable to apprehend what might have been said by her in the case of Mrs. Smith whether one takes it in the context or not. 
    44   As far as Hall is concerned I am unable to ascertain what adoption there may be of what propositions Gardener may be asserting. Despite the Crown's references to Hall asserting a willingness on his part to do a deal and plead guilty to the robbery, or Hall accepting that he had knowledge from one of the robbers that ""the guns were loaded up"", I simply cannot hear such material as is asserted to support those assertions so as to enable me to determine that he did say what the Crown contends he did. I cannot see that a juror could find those things were said. 
    45   It does seem that at some points that what was going on in these conversations was a discussion concerning what Clark had said and what courses the police officers might take concerning Hall in consequence. Even to say that, though, probably involves me reading from the transcript a deal into what I can hear. 
    46   These observations are made, however, after listening in court, as I have described, to tape 107, Exhibit D, since it was accepted by all parties that the in court enquiry might be limited to listening to tape 107 to see if there could, with sufficient clarity, be detected in what was said some of the matters to which the Crown has referred to me in argument and in the document Exhibit C treating the admissibility of those matters as being crucial for the Crown case. 
    47   Whether the objection should be determined in Hall's case, by reason of the application of s.88 and the concept of relevance referred to in s.55 or whether by reason of the exercise of the discretions provided for by the Evidence Act 1995, eg., under s.135, such that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial or be misleading or confusing; or s.137, if the probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice - probably matters not in this case. I am particularly cognizant of the dangers presented by such poor recordings as interpreted by police officers because of the salutary example referred to in Regina v. Murrell [2001] NSWCCA 179. 
    48   At common law this recorded material, such as I have heard, I am satisfied would not have been admitted by application of the principles in Regina v. Smith (1987) 7 NSWLR 444; Regina v. Brownlowe (1987) 7 NSWLR 461. However, those decisions predate the Evidence Act 1995 and have been the subject of much criticism in other decisions. Notably Bulejcik v. The Queen (1996) 1 CLR 315;  Regina v. Henshaw (1988) VR 362. Regina v. Jones (1989) 41 A. Crim. R. 1, and other decisions referred to in note 604 to the discussion in paragraph 114.10 in Odgers, Uniform Evidence Law (4th ed.) concerning aural identification. 
    49   Notwithstanding what the author refers to as the attitude taken by New South Wales Courts post-Evidence Act 1995 in continuing to follow the common law authorities, I am of the view that where it speaks the Act itself must be applied. I note of course that the Act makes no specific provision for aural identification as opposed to the provision that it makes for visual identification. Nor does it make any particular provision for the admissibility of the content of sounds, although it does, as I have said, provide a mode of proof for that content by s.48(1)(c) 
    50   Putting aside the transcript, I am unable to conclude that jurors utilising these enhanced recordings and utilising these headphones would have capabilities so much in excess of mine that they might reliably hear such things as are set out in the transcript, and putting aside the transcript I do not consider that the jurors would be able to extract from the recordings some such statements as would amount, in Hall's case, to relevant material admissions or a foundation to infer such as might meet the tests provided by s.88 and survive the invocation of the discretionary provisions of the Evidence Act 1995 to exclude such of it as is relevant. 
    51   Similarly, I am of the view that in the case of Mrs Smith and in the case of Mr. Gardener the material would not meet the tests provided by the discretionary provisions so as to avoid exclusion. 
    52   I have phrased what I have said in the way I have since I have not treated the matter as turning on the application of the onus on the Crown. Under the different provisions the onus differs. If one is dealing with the application of s.137 there is a positive onus to refuse to admit the evidence. In applying s.135, the onus is otherwise, but in this case, on these facts, I consider that is of limited moment. 
    53   In my view in this case there would be a danger of unfair prejudice due to the lack of clarity of the various statements relied on in the conversations and their context. The recordings are such that one cannot tell from such of the conversations one can hear whether there is qualification, negation or adoption by some other of the participants particularly as to what might have been said by Mr. Gardener. Unaccompanied by the transcript, one would not know what it make of the material. 
    54   Overall, I conclude that there is an unacceptable risk in admitting this evidence since its probative value can hardly be ascertained (but it does not include explicit inculpatory statements) and there is an overwhelming danger the evidence might be confusing or misleading. The danger of undue prejudice is apparent. It is not a matter of simply leaving this all to the jury with some general instruction that unless they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the case the Crown makes having regard to the whole of the evidence they should acquit. This material would require, were it to be admitted, most specific directions and it does not seem to me that those directions could answer the case and guard against the inevitable prejudice that the jury might speculate to the accused's disadvantage. It follows that even were the material tendered relevant, I would reject it by the application of s.135 or s.137. 
    55   I conclude that it matters not whether I assess that the material as lacking in relevance or probative effect because I cannot work out what most of it is or I consider that such probative effect as there might be is overwhelmed by the prejudicial effect of inducing impermissible speculation there is some sort of involvement of some kind in some criminality. It should be rejected. 
    56   I therefore rule that I am not prepared to admit the material the Crown has tendered. I appreciate the consequences that may have for the Crown case. 
    57   In consequence of the ruling I have made, the Crown Prosecutor will be seeking instructions to abandon the prosecution as it presently stands, accepting that there is no such evidence as would warrant it proceeding. 
    58   Application is however made by each of the accused for the present indictment to be stayed, except in the event that the Crown should enter a nolle prosequi. The Crown cannot resist and does not resist that application. Such a stay may be perpetual, absolute and unconditional. But it is not ""no matter what"".  
    59   In the event, as with a nolle prosequi, the Crown finds other evidence which would sustain the prosecution it will remain open to the Crown to move to set aside the stay and to proceed with a trial. Such an event however would require an application to the court to dissolve the stay. 
    60   In the circumstances the prosecution of each of the three accused for the offences now charged, which I have set out at the commencement of this judgment, is, except for the circumstances I have referred to, permanently stayed.

      70032/01 - REGINA v JEFFREY WILLIAM SPENCER ROSE 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT [No 1] - On application for Permanent Stay of Proceedings 
       
       
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: Mr Jeffrey Rose (“the accused”) is charged with the murder of his wife, Kristine Anne Rose (“the deceased”), on or about 30 April 1982. He is due to stand trial on Tuesday 2 October 2001. 
     
      
    2   By Notice of Motion the accused has sought an order permanently staying the proceedings. 
     
      
       
      Background 
       
      
    3   The accused and the deceased had been married for some time. They had three children. On the Crown case they had a troubled relationship, which included acts of violence by Mr Rose against the deceased. 
     
      
    4   In early 1982 the family moved from Coffs Harbour to Armidale. The deceased then separated from her husband. He was, at that time, unemployed, and in receipt of an invalid pension. The children remained with Mr Rose, although they were later transferred, at least for a time, to a home. 
     
      
    5   The deceased enrolled as a student at the University of New England at Armidale. She began a new life. Her new life included other men with whom she had sexual relationships. 
     
      
    6   In March 1982, the deceased moved into a flat in Claude Street, Armidale. The flat was not far from the campus. Mr Jeffery Rose, shortly after, was provided by the Government with a flat in Markham Street, Armidale. 
     
      
    7   The deceased and the accused continued to see each other. Indeed, they underwent counselling in respect of their marriage. It is the Crown case that Mr Rose found it difficult to accept his wife’s decision to leave him, and to take up with other men. He became jealous. He made threats against his wife, especially when affected by drink. He was skilled in karate. Ms Anne-Marie Reeves has provided a statement which includes the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “My parents used to invite Geoff to our flat to have a drink on occasions. It was mainly on weekends that he would visit. I remember that Geoff would get drunk and start talking about himself and his wife. I remember him saying a number of times,  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘I know how to kill somebody if I wanted to. I know how to do Karate. I know all the pressure points on a body and I could kill somebody just like that.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        As he said this he clicked his fingers. I remember him also saying, ‘I hate Kristine. All I care about is my kids.’” 
        
       
      
    8   Another witness, Michele Tracie Long, attributed to Mr Rose the following words, spoken when he was affected by alcohol approximately three weeks before the deceased disappeared: 
     
      
       
        
        “You know I’m going to kill my wife. I’m a karate expert. The best way would be to come up behind her and disable her with a karate blow. I could then strangle her with my hands. I could do it when she’s ironing because she would have her back to me and would be concentrating on ironing. I could also use the ironing cord and wrap it around her neck.” 
        
       
      
    9   He also said, “You know, you can kill someone with a karate blow”. 
     
      
    10   The University went into recess in May 1982. The deceased was invited by a male friend to go to Brisbane for two weeks. She made arrangements with other students to travel by bus to Brisbane. The bus was to leave Armidale at 11.00 pm on Friday 30 April 1982. The group arranged to meet beforehand at a hotel not far from the bus stop. 
     
      
    11   The deceased drove her car to the flat of the accused in Armidale. She arrived some time in the afternoon of the 30th. She had with her pot plants and a pet bird. She had apparently arranged for the accused to look after these items. She, in return, left him her car. He was, at that time, disqualified from driving. However, he had made arrangements the following Monday to undergo a test to requalify. It was said the deceased planned to shower at the accused’s flat before meeting her friends.  
     
      
    12   When the deceased had not arrived at the hotel by 10.00 pm her friends became concerned. They went to the flat of the accused. They arrived at about 10.40 pm and spoke to the accused. He said that he also was worried. A “young bloke” had called at the flat at about 6.30 pm, asking for Kristine. They had gone off together to the Bowling Club for a drink. When she had not returned by 9.00 pm, the accused said that he went to look for her. He went to the hotel. 
     
      
    13   The accused then went with one of his wife’s friends, Robert Delforce, to the police. The accused reported his wife missing. He was interviewed by the police the next day and repeated the same account. 
     
      
    14   Three weeks later, on 23 May 1982, the deceased’s body was found under a bridge in a remote area. The bridge was at Pipeclay Creek on Weirs Road, approximately seven kilometres from Armidale. She was dressed in jeans, a floral shirt and sneakers. She was wearing underpants. She had neither handbag, nor glasses. 
     
      
       
      Forensic Investigation 
       
      
    15   Determining the cause of death was difficult. The body was in an advanced state of decomposition and infested by maggots. There was a bruise to the neck, consistent with the inhibition of the vagal nerve. 
     
      
    16   Forensic investigation was undertaken in two areas. First, swabs were taken from the vagina. They revealed the presence of semen. Semen was also observed on the outside of the deceased’s underwear, not far from the vagina. The swabs and the underwear were tested by the Analytical Laboratories at Lidcombe. The blood group revealed by each test was that of the deceased. It was not the blood grouping of the accused. These tests, however, did not exclude the accused as the source of the semen. Vaginal secretions, when mixed with semen, will often produce the blood grouping of the woman. 
     
      
    17   Secondly, dust samples were taken from the rims of the deceased’s vehicle. Geologically, the dust was the same as that given off by the dirt road near the bridge where the deceased’s body was found. 
     
      
    18   The Coroner held an Inquest in June 1983. He recommended that the accused be charged with murder. The Attorney General, however, declined to file a bill. The accused, shortly thereafter, left Armidale to live in Victoria, where he has remained. 
     
      
       
      The Revival of the Prosecution 
       
      
    19   Some eighteen years after these events, the police received information which caused them to reopen the investigation. The case for the Crown will include both evidence assembled in 1982 and material uncovered since. In respect of the latter, two matters are important. First, the Crown case, as presented to the Coroner, did not include the two witnesses who claim to have heard the accused make threats against the deceased. One of those witnesses said that she spoke to the officer in charge of the investigation in 1982. She provided the same information which now appears in her statement. There is no record, amongst the papers in respect to the original investigation, of her having done so. The officer in charge of the investigation denies that anything was said to him. 
     
      
    20   Secondly, the Crown arranged for the dust samples, which were examined in 1982, to be further examined. Mr Stroud, geologist, produced a report of his examination. The report, one gathers, goes further than the original investigation by Dr Burns. Mr Stroud examined the geology of the Armidale region with a view to identifying those areas which may have been a possible source of the dust found on the vehicle rims. There are only a few such areas. The only location where there is both the geology revealed by the dust samples, and a dirt road, is Weirs Road leading to the bridge where the deceased’s body was found. More than that, the geology changes markedly at the location of the bridge. The inference is invited that the vehicle went to the bridge, and no further. Weirs Road, according to Mr Stroud, was the last dirt road over which the deceased’s vehicle travelled. Were the deceased murdered at the accused’s flat, transport from the flat to the bridge would involve travel along a bitumen road, and then Weirs Road. It is the Crown case that the accused made that journey, and dumped the body at the bridge. The dirt on the deceased’s clothing is consistent with dirt found on the interior of the vehicle. 
     
      
    21   The Crown case against the accused is, of course, a circumstantial case. It was described by the Crown as “a case of substance”. Essentially, the Crown relies upon the following circumstances: 
     
      
    · First, the troubled nature of the accused’s relationship with the deceased, and his refusal to accept her decision to leave. 
     
      
    · Secondly, the accused’s jealousy at the deceased’s relationship with other men, and his threats against her life. 
     
      
    · Thirdly, the accused’s capacity to carry out his threats, he being an expert in karate, and the opportunity to do so on the afternoon of 30 April 1982. 
     
      
    · Fourthly, the geological evidence suggesting that the accused used the deceased’s vehicle to transport her body to the bridge on Weirs Road. 
     
      
    · Fifthly, the presence of the deceased’s glasses in the accused’s flat, observed the day after she disappeared. On the Crown case the deceased was extremely short sighted. She habitually wore glasses. 
     
      
    · Finally, the account of the “young bloke” calling for the deceased at 6.30 pm is, according to the Crown, implausible. No-one fitting the description he provided was known to anyone who had an association with the deceased. 
     
      
       
      The Basis of the Application 
       
      
    22   It was acknowledged, on behalf of the accused, that an order staying a prosecution will only be made in extreme or exceptional circumstances. Adopting the framework of relevant indicia identified by Deane J in Jago v The District Court of New South Wales & Ors (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 60-61, Counsel for the accused pointed to three matters which, in his submission, made the case exceptional. 
     
      
    23   First, although the accused had no right to a speedy trial, he had “the right to be trial without unreasonable delay” (Jago (supra) at 59). Here the delay was extraordinary, almost 19 years. The accused had not contributed to the delay. 
     
      
    24   Secondly, quite apart from the general prejudice which may be assumed to arise from delay (cf Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79; Crampton v The Queen (2000) 117 A Crim R 222), the delay in this case had occasioned specific prejudice to the accused. The vaginal swabs and the underpants of the deceased had been discarded or lost. It is no longer possible for the accused to have them tested by modern day DNA analysis. Had they been available, and had semen remained, further testing may have demonstrated that the semen was that of another man. The Crown’s task, in that event, in excluding all hypotheses consistent with innocence, would have been significantly more difficult, if not impossible. 
     
      
    25   Thirdly, whilst the public has an interest in the prosecution of serious crime, that interest is diluted in circumstances where the Crown has a “very weak” case. 
     
      
    26   Elaborating upon these matters, it was said that the hypothesis arising from the geological evidence was not as persuasive as it may at first appear. The experts are not able to say when the dust accumulated upon the rims of each wheel. It is therefore possible that it may have been deposited before the vehicle was dropped off by the deceased. The deceased may herself have driven on Weirs Road. Indeed, that section of the road is not far from her home, and is close to New England University, which she attended. 
     
      
    27   The Crown responded by drawing attention to a map attached to the geologist’s report. There was no plausible reason why the deceased would have used that section of Weirs Road which led to the bridge. It was a dirt road, when sealed roads were available providing access to locations she was known to visit. It was significantly longer and less direct as a means to access to such places. I am inclined to accept, prima facie, that it would be highly unusual, on the information provided, for the deceased to have chosen to travel along the dirt road. 
     
      
    28   It is, according to Counsel for the accused, hardly surprising that the dirt upon the deceased’s clothing was consistent with that in her vehicle. It was her vehicle. She travelled in it. You would expect whatever dirt was in the vehicle would transfer to her clothing. 
     
      
    29   So far as the glasses of the deceased are concerned, a number of witnesses at the committal proceedings said that the deceased had two pairs of glasses, which were described. Indeed, some witnesses said that the deceased sometimes chose not to wear glasses. 
     
      
    30   Although there is force in these arguments, I am inclined to accept that the Crown case is “one of substance”. 
     
      
    31   The real complaint by the accused concerns the destruction or loss of evidence. Professor Boettcher was called on behalf of the accused on the application. He provided a report which included the following opinion: 
     
      
       
        
        “However, Goetz attempted grouping tests on ‘the seminal stained items’, presumably both the swabs and the panties. To perform such tests he would have made aqueous extracts of the semen stains. Presumably he would have cut out the stains from the panties. Consequently, in making the aqueous extracts, Goetz would have washed many of the sperm heads from the items. Further, he might well have then discarded both the swabs and the material cut from the panties that had the stains on it. 
        
       
       
        
        Nevertheless, if the swabs of the material cut from the panties were now available, I would expect that there could well be a sufficient number of sperm heads caught in the fabric of the swabs or the material to enable a DNA profile to be determined today. 
        
       
       
        
        I consider that it would be worthwhile trying to re-test the vaginal swabs and the material from the panties.” 
        
       
      
    32   Professor Boettcher said that good forensic practice, even in 1982, required the retention of exhibits. He had accumulated a cupboard of such specimens, many of which dated from the early 1980s. 
     
      
    33   Mr Goetz, the head of the Analytical Laboratories at Lidcombe, was called by the Crown. It was, in fact, Mr Goetz who, in 1982, had undertaken the tests upon the swabs and underwear. As was mentioned by Professor Boettcher, the tests involved a washing process. That process may have removed all traces of sperm. Indeed, Mr Goetz thought it unlikely that, even had the exhibit been retained, they would have been suitable for testing by modern DNA techniques. However, he acknowledged, the possibility that sperm may have remained. 
     
      
    34   To carry out the tests on the underwear, Mr Goetz had cut out four segments of cloth, each the size of a ten cent piece. Each piece was then subjected to a washing process. It was possible, although in Mr Goetz’s opinion unlikely, that sufficient sperm heads would have remained to enable DNA testing. Had the remnants of the underwear (from which the cloth had been cut) been retained, it is possible that fabric with semen would still have been available, in which case it would yield a DNA profile of the source of the semen.  
     
      
    35   The accused submitted that he had lost the opportunity of demonstrating positively that it was not his sperm. That opportunity, in the context of this case, is the more significant, according to the accused, because of the following evidence given by Mr Goetz at the Coroner’s Inquest in June 1983: (T 51/52) 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And you see the item 11, the panties, where did you detect the presence of semen on them? 
         
        A. Semen present on the panties was on the side section, on the outside of the panties. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. On the outside? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Would that be unusual in your view? 
         
        A. Yes, it is. Mainly because if a person is active after having intercourse you would expect drainage from the vaginal area onto the inside of the crutch of the panties, not onto the outside of the panties. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And would that feature be consistent with the deceased remaining prone after intercourse? 
         
        A. It’s very difficult to say, it would depend probably on the position of the panties in relation to the vagina. If the area was turned inside out at that location, it is very difficult to say exactly that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well, if the assumption be put that after intercourse the deceased was fully clothed and walked would you expect semen on the inside of the panties? 
         
        A. Yes, I would.” 
        
       
      
    36   Mr Goetz adhered to that view in cross examination before me. 
     
      
    37   Here, as mentioned, the evidence was that the deceased arrived at the flat mid afternoon. She was active. Had the sperm found in her vagina, and on her underwear, been deposited before her arrival, you would have expected semen on the inside of the underwear. That suggested, according to the accused, that she did not move after intercourse and before she was murdered. For the accused to be guilty, therefore, on this argument, it would have to be his semen. Had he been able to demonstrate conclusively that it was not his semen, and that it was the semen of someone else, the Crown would have failed on its circumstantial case. 
     
      
    38   The Crown responded to these arguments by asserting that it was not an essential circumstance on the Crown case, that the accused had intercourse with the deceased before she was murdered (Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573), although it was possible that he had. 
     
      
    39   However, the semen may be that of another man, and yet other circumstances, proved by the Crown, may exclude any reasonable explanation other than the guilt of the accused. There were a number of possible explanations for the absence of semen on the inside of the underwear. There was evidence that the deceased intended to have a shower at the flat of the accused. It was possible that she may have been murdered whilst undressed, and that she was later dressed by the accused with underwear she had not been wearing, although stained with semen. There were other possibilities besides. 
     
      
    40   Although the matter was not fully argued, I am inclined, at this stage, to agree that it is not an essential circumstance in the Crown case that the accused had intercourse with the deceased, and that the semen, which was present, was his semen. 
     
      
       
      Principles Relating to a Stay 
       
      
    41   The principles in respect of an application for a permanent stay have been authoritatively stated by the High Court (Barton v The Queen (1980) 147 CLR 75; Jago v The District Court of New South Wales (supra)). An order will only be made in extreme or exceptional circumstances. The touchstone is fairness. In judging fairness, the Court must balance the community’s expectation that persons charged with serious crimes will be brought to trial, and the further expectation that such trials, when they occur, will be fair. 
     
      
    42   When is a trial likely to be unfair? Delay, as such, is unquestionably prejudicial (Longman v The Queen (supra); Crampton v The Queen (supra)). It is prejudicial both to the Crown and, relevantly, to the accused. Deane J in Jago (supra) said this: (at 60) 
     
      
       
        
        “The starting point will be consideration of the question whether the delay is so prolonged that it is unreasonable in the context of the particular case.” 
        
       
      
    43   His Honour added: (at 60) 
     
      
       
        
        “It will not, however, of itself and viewed in isolation, suffice to found an order that the proceedings be stayed. In that regard, it is relevant to note that, in the context of an accused being entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt, the vagueness and uncertainty of memory and evidence which is likely to result from delay is more likely to be damaging to the prosecution than to the defence case. An order that proceedings be permanently stayed will only be justified in the exceptional cases which I have indicated, namely, where it appears that the effect of the unreasonable delay is, in all the circumstances, that any subsequent trial will necessarily be an unfair one or that the continuation of the proceedings would be so unfairly oppressive that it would constitute an abuse of process.” 
        
       
      
    44   The issue is whether the defect, said to produce unfairness, is fundamental, such that it goes to the root of the trial, so there is nothing the trial Judge can do to relieve the unfair consequences (Wilson J in Barton v The Queen (supra) at 111 (adopted by Mason CJ in Jago (supra) at 34)). 
     
      
    45   It sometimes happens, especially in the context of delay, that witnesses important to the defence die or are unavailable at the time of the trial, or, as happened in this case, exhibits are lost. Unquestionably that is prejudicial to the accused. That prejudice does not confer an automatic right to a stay, as Gleeson CJ explained in The Queen v McCarthy & Ors (CCA, unreported, 12 August 1994): 
     
      
       
        
        “Time and time again it happens in criminal proceedings that for any one of a variety of reasons witnesses who may be regarded as important by one side or the other die, or become ill, or lose their memory, or lose documents. If the result of that were that nobody could obtain a fair trial, and the proceedings had to be permanently stayed, it would go a long way towards solving the problems of delay in the criminal lists in this State. However, the position is that it is well recognised that an occurrence of that kind does not of itself mean that a person cannot obtain a fair trial or that proceedings need to be stayed. In this connection I refer to what was said in  
        R v Adler 
         (unreported, CCA, 11 June 1992) and  
        R v Goldberg 
         (unreported, CCA, 23 February 1993).” 
        
       
      
    46   In R v Adler (unreported, NSWCCA, 11 June 1992), Gleeson CJ (with whom other members of the Court agreed) said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “The fact that a witness who is potentially able to corroborate an accused is, for one reason or another, such as death, disappearance or disability, unavailable at trial, does not normally produce the result that the accused cannot obtain a fair trial …” 
        
       
      
    47   The onus is upon the person seeking a stay (Barron v AG (1987) 10 NSWLR 215 at 219, 233). It was described by Hodgson J in R v Littler [2001] NSWCCA 173 (at para 6), as “a heavy onus” because of the nature of the order which is sought. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    48   I accept that, by reason of the extraordinary delay, the accused has been prejudiced. I further accept that the loss of exhibits, and especially the underwear, robs the accused of the possibility of proving that the semen was that of another man. However, I do not accept that the loss of that opportunity is fundamental, going to the root of the trial, and that it cannot be alleviated by appropriate direction. I have reached this view for a number of reasons. 
     
      
    49   First, the items which were lost were the subject of analysis in 1982. That analysis, so far as it went, assisted the accused. It was not his blood type. It was the blood type of the deceased. Although that finding is not conclusive, it ameliorates, to some degree, the difficulties which have arisen. 
     
      
    50   Secondly, even had the exhibits been retained, there is no certainty that they would have yielded a sufficient sample of semen to enable DNA analysis. That is a possibility, but no more than a possibility. Had the sample been capable of being tested, it may have assisted the Crown case, rather than that of the accused. 
     
      
    51   Thirdly, it will often happen, in an imperfect world, that issues will be left unresolved which, had they been resolved, may or may not have assisted the accused. In The Queen v King [2000] NSWCCA 507, the accused was charged with robbery and aggravated sexual assault. The victim was heavily pregnant at the time. She was attacked at night and blindfolded. When she ultimately raised the alarm, she complained of the robbery, but not the sexual assault. The assault was a matter of acute embarrassment to her. She eventually revealed the assault to her husband and the police the following day. By that stage, the procedures followed routinely by the police in the case of sexual assault were of no use. The means of identifying the DNA of her assailant was lost. 
     
      
    52   The accused denied that he was this woman’s assailant. There was, nonetheless, a strong circumstantial case against him. He was convicted. He ultimately complained to the Court of Criminal Appeal that a direction should have been given by the trial Judge concerning the disadvantage to him through the victim’s failure to raise the issue of the sexual assault. It deprived him of the ability to demonstrate the presence of another. The appeal (Fitzgerald JA, Whealy and Howie JJ) was dismissed. 
     
      
    53   There could, in that case, be no suggestion that, having been deprived (in that case by the complainant) of the opportunity of demonstrating the presence of another, the accused could not receive a fair trial. The issue on the appeal was whether, to overcome the disadvantage to the accused, through the loss of opportunity to prove the presence of another man, a direction should have been given. 
     
      
    54   There will be cases where that which is lost is so fundamental that it goes to the root of the trial. In R v Reeves (122 ACTR 1), the accused was a partner in an engineering firm. The Crown alleged that he and a consultant, Mr Royale, created false and misleading accounts. Mr Royale committed suicide. The company, in winding up its operations, destroyed a “massive number of records”, including the working papers of Mr Royale, his files and correspondence. An application was made for a stay. Gallop J said this: (at 23) 
     
      
       
        
        “Even if a prima facie inference was available to the Crown in the sense that it could establish an hypothesis consistent with guilt, the destruction of the documents, after the institution of the criminal proceedings against him, has created a situation whereby he is deprived of properly advancing a contesting hypothesis consistent with innocence.” 
        
       
      
    55   His Honour added: (at 23) 
     
      
       
        
        “Having considered all the circumstances, I have concluded that because of the destruction of documents it is not possible for the applicant to receive a fair trial. That destruction creates a fundamental defect which goes to the root of the trial and I do not believe that there is anything that a trial judge could do in the conduct of the trial that could relieve against its unfair consequences:  
        Barton v R 
         (1980) 32 ALR 449; 147 CLR 73 per Wilson J at 111.” 
        
       
      
    56   In contrast, in R v Irena Hatfield [1999] NSWCCA 340, the accused was charged with the murder of her husband in April 1985. In August 1997 the accused sought a stay. A number of exhibits had been lost which she claimed were important in demonstrating her innocence. The following had been lost since the investigation began: (para 5) 
     
      
       
        
        “(i) The Brno brand .22 calibre firearm and silencer. 
         
        (ii) Clothing worn by the accused at the time. 
         
        (iii) The clothing worn by the deceased. 
         
        (iv) A woollen blanket which was partly covering the deceased when he was found. 
         
        (v) A glass from the room in which the deceased was found and on which were some bloodstains.” 
        
       
      
    57   Further, the Crown case substantially depended upon a Mr Busby. Mr Busby had undergone counselling. The counselling notes had been lost, or destroyed, thereby depriving the accused of a potent means of challenge to his evidence. Yet, notwithstanding these matters, Grove J (first instance) and the Court of Criminal Appeal (Sully, Hulme and Hidden JJ) refused a stay.  
     
      
    58   In all the circumstances, I am not satisfied that I should stay the proceedings. I therefore make the following orders. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
       
      1. The Notice of Motion of 5 September 2001 seeking a permanent stay is dismissed. 
       
       
      2. The trial date of 2 October 2001 is confirmed. 
       
       
      3. This judgment should not be published (save as to the orders made) until the conclusion of the trial, or further order.

       REGINA v REINHARD SCHMAKOWSKI 
        
        
       JUDGMENT 
       
     1 HEYDON JA: I ask Wood CJ at CL to give the first judgment. 
     2 WOOD CJ at CL: On 24 March 2000 the applicant was sentenced by his Honour Judge Maguire in the District Court for an offence of importing a trafficable quantity of MDMA or Ecstasy, contrary to s 233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901. The sentence imposed was one of eight years with a non-parole period of four years and nine months. 
     3 The pure quantity of the drugs involved was 410 grams, that is 90 grams less than the commercial quantity applicable for this substance. The wholesale value of the importation was assessed to be in the order of $240,000. The applicant now seeks leave to appeal against the sentence. 
      
       
      Facts 
     4 The applicant was a German citizen, aged forty-three years, with no prior convictions, who was a resident in Indonesia. He was contacted by telephone and offered $5000 Australian to transport drugs to Australia. Upon agreeing to this arrangement an airline ticket was provided for him to fly to Amsterdam. After arriving there he was given a body pack fitted with three compartments, each of which held a plastic clip-sealed bag containing the drugs in tablet form. He left Amsterdam for Sydney on 21 May 1999 and arrived at Sydney Kingsford-Smith Airport the following day. After being selected for a frisk search, the body pack was found by members of the Australian Customs Service. 
     5 During a subsequent interview he disclosed that arrangements had been made for him to book into either the Hilton Hotel or the Nikko Hotel, where he was to await instructions for delivery of the drugs. Enquiry of these hotels found that a reservation had been made for him at the Nikko Hotel. Thereafter, under the supervision of the AFP, arrangements were made for him to assist in a controlled delivery.  
     6 Over the ensuing three days he remained at the hotel and assisted police in answering phone calls made to his room. The operation did not, however, prove fruitful. It appears that he had expected that this would be the case, as he informed the Australian Federal Police agents from the outset that it was too late to effect a controlled delivery. 
     7 When formally interviewed by police on 24 May 1999 he provided detailed admissions concerning the offence. He entered a plea of guilty when taken before the Local Court and was committed for sentence. He adhered to his plea in the District Court and was sentenced upon the basis that he had pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity. 
     8 It was the applicant's account that his involvement in this exercise had commenced with an unexpected telephone call from someone whom he did not know but who, in some unidentified way, had become aware that he travelled frequently to Australia on business. In this regard, it appears that he had a history of working in the banking and financial industries in Germany and Indonesia. His reason for accepting the offer, he said, was connected with the fact that he had suffered some financial reverses in Indonesia and had recently been the victim of a robbery in which he had lost some US$15,000. 
     9 The applicant had, in fact, made some twelve or so earlier flights to and from Australia over the nine months preceding his arrest, each of which had been paid for in cash. He had $13,750 in Australian currency in his possession. He denied ever having carried drugs into this country before. The learned sentencing Judge accepted that there was no evidence to the contrary of that assertion. It was the applicant's case that he was simply a courier who was carrying drugs on instructions and that he should be sentenced as such. 
     10 His Honour made it plain, before proceeding to sentence, that he was unable to accept such a proposition, even though the Crown was, apparently, content to have the applicant sentenced upon that basis. He invited the applicant to adduce any further evidence which he deemed fit to make the proposition good. Neither the applicant nor the Crown took up the opportunity so offered. As a result, his Honour said that he had no confidence in the applicant's version of events, and simply did not accept his account as to how he became involved, or as to the extent of his involvement. The reasons which he gave for that conclusion were spelled out cogently and in detail. I am not persuaded that his assessment was incorrect. 
     11 His Honour noted that, in these circumstances the evidence did not allow him to make an accurate assessment of the precise nature of the applicant's involvement in the importation. Accordingly, his Honour said: 
      
       
       ""I will simply deal with him as a person guilty of importing the subject drugs on the occasion in question. As was stated in  
       Regina v Storey 
        (1998) 1 VR 359 at 369: 
        
         
          
           'A sentencing Judge may not take facts into account in a way that is adverse to the interests of the accused unless the facts have been established beyond reasonable doubt. On the other hand, if there are circumstances which the Judge proposes to take into account in favour of the accused, it is enough if those circumstances are proved on the balance of probabilities.' 
          
         
        
       
       
       No question arises of me making any findings adverse to the interests of the accused."" 
       
     12 No complaint was made and nor could it properly have been made, that his Honour fell into error in dealing with the objective criminality of the applicant as an importer, rather than as a mere courier. In fact, the case was one which fell precisely into the category of case discussed in Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270, where it was recognised that the utility of attempting to categorise the role of the offender was limited by the extent to which the material facts were known.  
     13 Moreover, as this Court has made clear in Pilley (1991) 56 A Crim R 202, it was for his Honour alone to determine the relevant facts in conformity with the essential elements of the crime which the plea established. 
     14 In the course of pronouncing sentence, his Honour observed: 
      
       
       "" ... in view of the fac 
       t 
        that he was caught red-handed with the drugs strapped to his person, his conviction would appear to have been inevitable. His plea of guilty has of course saved the expense of a trial. However, this is not a matter in which a plea of guilty attracts a major discount."" 
       
     15 The observation reflected what had been said in Ferrer-Eisis (1991) 55 A Crim R 231 and Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603. 
     16 Later his Honour recorded, after noting the subjective circumstances mentioned in the reports prepared by Dr Roberts and by the Probation & Parole Officer: 
      
       
       ""He will receive the consideration to which he is entitled by reason of his clear criminal history, his admissions and his prompt plea and the co-operation which he afforded to the police."" 
       
     17 It is in relation to this aspect of the reasons for sentence that the applicant submits there was an error of law. In summary, it is submitted that his Honour failed to reflect in the sentence, the utilitarian value of the plea, the applicant's attempts to assist the authorities, and the contrition which he had demonstrated, with the consequence that the sentence was manifestly excessive. Additionally, it was submitted that the starting point of sixteen years, which his Honour must have adopted, assuming an allowance of approximately one-third for the absence of remissions, and a discount of twenty-five per cent for the subjective circumstances, was too high, when compared with the maximum available sentence of twenty-five years, and when compared with the sentencing statistics. 
     18 The sentence was pronounced before the guideline judgment in Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 the reasoning of which, it has been accepted, is generally applicable to sentencing for Commonwealth offences: Bugeja NSW CCA 11 May 2001. However, so far as that decision is relied upon in support of the existence of an obligation, on the part of sentencing Judges, to quantify expressly the discount given for the plea, and for other matters such as assistance, then that is to introduce into the sentence a wholly inappropriate mathematical approach: Pearce (1998) 104 CLR 610 at 624. 
     19 The relevant portion of the guideline was, in fact, expressed in advisory, rather than mandatory terms, as follows: 
      
       
       ""(ii) sentencing Judges are encouraged to quantify the effect of the plea on the sentence insofar as they believe it appropriate to do so. This effect can encompass any or all of the matters to which the plea may be relevant - contrition, witness vulnerability and utilitarian value - but particular encouragement is given to the quantification of the last-mentioned matter. Where other matters are regarded as appropriate to be quantified in a particular case, for example, assistance to authorities, a single combined quantification will often be appropriate."" 
       
     20 The case is not one where his Honour appears to me to have fallen into the error noted in Carter (2001) NSW CCA 245 of diminishing the utilitarian value of the plea for the reason that the applicant's conviction was inevitable. More relevant in an evaluation of the worth of the plea is the consideration that any trial would have been exceedingly short, given the circumstances of the applicant's arrest and his subsequent admissions. 
     21 Ultimately, the question in an appeal such as the present, is whether the sentencing order as a whole was excessive to the point of disclosing error of law. This requires a consideration of the objective and subjective circumstances of the case, including those relevant to the fact and timing of the plea, and the nature and extent of any assistance offered or given. 
     22 In the present appeal, three cases were identified by the applicant as indicative of a proper range for a case involving a trafficable quantity of MDMA, an early plea and assistance. They were the decisions in Hauser NSW CCA 11 December 1997, Bowers (1997) 97 A Crim R 461 and Bourel NSW CCA 11 December 1998. By reference to these decisions, and assuming a discount in the order of twenty-five per cent, it was submitted that the sentence here imposed should have been in the order of six years with a non-parole period of three and a half years. 
     23 I am not persuaded that the decisions relied upon by the applicant are of much assistance. They represent a small proportion of the many cases which have now been dealt with at first instance, or upon appeal, in relation to the importation of Ecstasy, since the case of Schaal which came before me in 1989 and which seems to have occupied the vanguard so far as this substance is concerned.  
     24 Similarly, I am not persuaded that the sentencing statistics are of much assistance. First, it may be noted that those which have been provided embrace a period which closes in March 2000. Over the last eighteen months there have been many other cases involving this substance. Moreover, as has been pointed out many times in this Court, sentencing statistics provide no more than a general indication against which the subjective and objective circumstances of each case must be weighed. 
     25 Further, while the quantity of the drug involved remains relevant for sentencing purposes, this is but one factor, the significance of the gulf between trafficable and commercial quantities lessening the more a case moves, as does the present case, into the high range for a trafficable quantity: See Spillane (1999) NSW CCA 280 at par 14 per Hidden J and also Doan NSW CCA 27 September 1996 where Hunt CJ at CL rejected the notion that sentencing for offences of this kind were to be approached by reference to some precise mathematical relationship between the sentence and the amount of drugs involved. 
     26 The offence of which the applicant stood convicted, his Honour appropriately noted, was a most serious crime being one which had been committed 'for sheer greed' and being one for which the question of both personal and general deterrence loomed large.  
     27 One paragraph of his Honour's remarks on sentence are pertinent, since it has unqualified support in the very many judgments which this Court regrettably finds it is necessary to deliver in relation to foreign nationals who elect to run drugs into this country, for example Muanchukingkan (1990) 52 A Crim R 354 and Laurentiu and Becheru NSW CCA 1 October 1992. It is the passage in which his Honour said: 
      
       
       ""It must be seen that there is a real price to pay for flaunting the laws prohibiting the importation of drugs. Judicial officers have a responsibility to fix sentences which are designed not only to punish but to serve as an effective deterrent."" 
       
     28 I cannot but concur wholeheartedly with that view. The reward/risk ratio for drug importers is high but those who are caught must expect condign sentences for a form of conduct which is inimical to the interests of this country and which is driven by nothing other than naked self-interest. Offenders such as the present must be taken to have been aware of the risk of being detained in custody in a foreign gaol. The hardships associated with that consequence, although not to be ignored, have limited significance. 
     29 I am not persuaded that the sentence in this case, while heavy, was outside a legitimate exercise of sentencing discretion. In particular I consider that an exercise of the kind undertaken in Bourel in which a sentencing pattern was sought to be derived from a collection of cases, involving a wide range of objective and subjective circumstances, is fraught with the same difficulty as that identified in the use of sentencing statistics. If viewed as providing an indicative range, then some assistance may be provided. However, sentencing remains individual and every case must be considered in the light of the objective seriousness of the offence and the maximum penalty prescribed by the legislature, as well as in the light of the subjective circumstances of the offender. 
     30 I would grant leave to appeal but I would dismiss the appeal. 
     31 HEYDON JA: I agree with Wood CJ at CL. 
     32 CARRUTHERS AJ: I also agree. 
     33 HEYDON JA: The orders of the Court will be as proposed by Wood CJ at CL.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 HEYDON JA: I will ask Wood CJ at CL to deliver the first judgment. 
      
       
     2 WOOD CJ AT CL: This applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Solomon in the District Court, on 1 June 2000, following his plea of guilty to one count of importing into Australia a trafficable quantity of cocaine to which section 233B of the Customs Act 1901 applied. He had offered that plea in the Local Court and adhered to it when appearing for sentence in the District Court.  
      
       
     3 The sentence pronounced was one of six years and six months to commence from the date of his arrest, with a non-parole period of four years and three months.  
      
       
        
       Facts 
       
     4 The Crown case was incontestable since the applicant was arrested at Sydney Airport upon his arrival, having swallowed fifty-two objects containing cocaine. The total net weight of cocaine in the objects, which were later passed by him, was 162.7 grams. As such the case fell into the category of offences characterised in the guideline judgment of Wong & Leung (1999) 48 NSWLR 340 as one involving a courier and a low level trafficable quantity. 
      
       
     5 The offence was committed solely for the purpose of financial gain, in that the anticipated reward to the applicant for the transportation of the cocaine was US$10,000. 
      
       
     6 At the time of his arrest the applicant denied having concealed any drugs internally. He withdrew his consent for an internal examination. When interviewed by police he declined to answer any questions, as was his right.  
      
       
     7 When spoken to by a Probation & Parole Officer he gave a very different version of events to that offered to the Court. In that report it was noted that he appeared to be lacking in remorse.  
      
       
     8 It was submitted by his Counsel that error was evident in the fact that the sentence fell at the top of the range of five to seven years mentioned in the guideline judgment, for a low level trafficable quantity, reflecting a reduction of only six months, which when expressed as a percentage of the 'high point of the range' was equivalent to a reduction of seven per cent. This, it was submitted, was inadequate in a case where contrition was found; where there had been a plea of guilty at a very early stage; where the offender was a twenty-four year old who had no prior criminal record; who would serve the sentence separated from his family in South Africa and who was showing signs of depression.  
      
       
     9 By analogy with the decision in Thomson & Houlten (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 it was submitted that a discount in the order of twenty per cent to twenty-five per cent should have been allowed for the utilitarian value of the plea, apart from any additional discount for remorse or contrition.  
      
       
     10 Some reliance was placed upon the decision of a two-Judge Bench in Lo (2001) NSW CCA 271, where it was held, in a case involving an early plea, for which otherwise a trial lasting two or three days would have been required, that a reduction for the utilitarian value of the plea in the order of fifteen per cent was appropriate. That decision properly recognised that the strength of the Crown case has no relevance to the utilitarian value of the plea, which is concerned only with the time and expense which would be occasioned to the justice system in the event of a trial being necessary. Statements to that effect were made by Howie J in Carter (2001) NSW CCA 245 and by Spigelman CJ in Thomson & Houlten, the latter of which, it may be accepted, has been regarded as applicable to sentencing for Commonwealth offences; Bugeja (2001) NSW CCA 196. 
      
       
     11 Otherwise, the decision cannot be elevated as an authority operating as a supplement to, or qualification of Thomson & Houlten to the effect that a discount of at least fifteen per cent must be given in a comparable case. 12 In that regard I would respectfully adopt the observations made recently by Sully J and Carruthers AJ in R v Hayes [2001] NSW CCA 358 as to the manner in which the decision in Lo should be approached. As Carruthers AJ observed at par 20 of his judgment: 
      
       
        
         
          
         ""In careful submissions on behalf of the Crown, Ms Woodburne has drawn the Court's attention to a number of distinguishing features between  
         Lo's 
          case and this case. It would be sufficient, in my view, however, if I referred to the fact that two-Judge Benches of this Court are constituted to deal with cases where questions of sentencing principle are not really in issue but rather to deal with matters where there are well-established sentencing principles and the question which arises is the application of those principles to the facts of the particular case. Thus, what was said in  
         Lo 
          by her Honour, with due respect, must be considered in the light of that situation."" 
         
        
       
       
     13 Sully J, similarly, made the following observations in relation to Lo at pars 42 to 44 of his judgment: 
      
       
        
         
          
         "" ... it will be necessary for some time to come that two-Judge Benches of this Court distinguish very carefully between the application as a matter of fact of principles established in the guideline judgment; and the glossing of those principles by the too ready enunciation of what are said to be further principles of law derivable from the guideline judgment itself.  
         
        
       
       
        
         
         The situation is completely clear. As matters stand, the law in this State relevant to the question of discounting of sentences for pleas of guilty is authoritatively stated in the guideline judgment itself. The law is not authoritatively stated by single instances of law-making by miscellaneous two-Judge Benches of the Court. 
         
        
        
         
         Unless that principle is adhered to with care, the Court is going to find itself in the situation where in practically every case of a plea of guilty, there will be an argument, not based so much upon the principles established in the guideline judgment itself, but based upon adventitious statements, said to be statements of legal principle, made by two-Judge Benches of the Court"". 
         
        
       
     14 It is important, for the reasons identified in that decision, and for the reasons which I have identified that Lo not be relied upon as authority for any proposition for which it does not properly stand.  
      
       
     15 It has become fashionable, in recent times, to seek to elevate sentencing to a precise mathematical exercise and to look to guideline judgments as a form of judicial straight-jackets. In truth, as has been repeatedly said, they provide useful guidelines, or a sounding board, for the assistance of sentencing Judges to which they should have regard when pronouncing sentence: Karacic (2001) NSW CCA 12 per Spigelman CJ at par 52. 
      
       
     16 Once a matter comes to this Court for leave to appeal, what must be shown, in the absence of patent misapplication of principle, is a sufficient degree of departure from a proper exercise of sentencing discretion as to reveal a latent area of law; such that some other sentence was warranted in law and should have been passed: s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
      
       
     17 The present is not a case where any relevant sentencing principle was ignored. The fact of the plea of guilty was expressly taken into account, as were the applicant's subjective circumstances, including the somewhat favourable finding as to his contrition. The applicant is, accordingly, left with the proposition that latent error is to be assumed from the fact that the sentence fell towards the top of the range for a legitimate exercise of sentencing discretion. 
      
       
     18 In this regard, the remarks of Howie J in Kook (2001) NSW CCA 122 are apposite: 
      
       
        
         
          
         ""Although the guideline involved in  
         R v Wong & Leung 
          encompasses all relevant matters including a plea;  
         R v Thomson & Houlten 
          (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at 491, it does not follow that her Honour erred in choosing a sentence which is at the top of the range specified in the guideline for the quantity of drug involved. It is important to bear in mind that a sentencing guideline is indicative only and it may be departed from in the proper exercise of a sentencing discretion:  
         R v Jurisic 
          (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 220;  
         R v Henry 
          (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at 356, 358. It may well be that a sentence which is outside the guideline may attract the close scrutiny of this Court to determine whether the sentence was justified by the particular facts of the matters. But the fact that the sentence imposed by her Honour is at the top of the range of sentences reflected in the guideline notwithstanding that the applicant pleaded guilty, does not necessarily require a finding that her Honour's sentencing discretion miscarried or that the sentence is manifestly excessive."" 
         
        
       
     19 It was entirely appropriate that any sentence imposed in this case carry with it a strong deterrent element. The culpability of couriers remains significant, particularly in cases where their motive is purelyone of profit, whether that be for personal greed or to meet financial difficulties:  Laurentiu & Becheru NSW CCA 1 October 1992; Botero NSW CCA 24 June 1998 and Virgin (2000) NSW CCA 307. 
      
       
     20 I am not persuaded, after reference to Wong & Leung and earlier decisions such as Doan NSW CCA 27 September 1999 and  Noubuisi NSW CCA 27 March 1992, that the sentence here imposed was excessive to the point of demonstrating error. I also wish to add that the hardship experienced by a foreign national who faces incarceration after coming to this country for the specific purpose of running drugs into it, is of limited value: Ferrer-Eisis (1991) A Crim R 231 at 239 per Hunt CJ at CL and Chu NSW CCA 16 October 1998. Those who decide to chance the odds of successfully breaching the customs barrier, in the expectation of a handsome reward, need to understand that there is a significant price to pay if their luck runs out, which includes an extended dislocation from their family and friends. 
      
       
     21 I would grant leave to appeal but I would dismiss the appeal. 
      
       
     22 HEYDON JA: I agree with Wood CJ at CL. 
      
       
     23 CARRUTHERS AJ: I also agree. 
      
       
     24 HEYDON JA: The orders of the Court are, accordingly, those proposed by Wood CJ at CL.

       REGINA v ADAM CLAUDE SLOANE 
        
       
       
       JUDGMENT 
     1 WOOD CJ AT CL: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions, pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the sentence imposed upon the respondent by his Honour, Judge Goldring in the District Court, on 22 June 2001. 
     2 That sentence was passed following the respondent's conviction, after trial, of an offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm upon an off duty police officer, Senior Constable Clive Swanston. Two offences of assault were committed upon two other men in the course of the same incident in which Senior Constable Swanston received his injuries. They were taken into account on a Form 1.  
     3 The sentence imposed was one of imprisonment for two years and eleven months to be served by way of periodic detention. A non-parole period of two years was set. In imposing this sentence, his Honour took into account a period of broken pre-sentence custody amounting to sixty-five days. It may be observed that since the sentence was passed the respondent has performed the equivalent of nine weeks of periodic detention. 
      
       
      Reasons for Sentence Inadequate 
     4 The remarks on sentence were noticeably sparse in relation to the facts upon the basis of which his Honour passed sentence. In part, this seems to have been due to the suspicions which his Honour expressed more than once, although without stating the reasons for them, that the victim and other police witnesses had embellished their evidence, and that in some way the incident had been provoked by Senior Constable Swanston in circumstances where he had been unduly affected by alcohol. 
     5 In fairness to the relevant witnesses, and for the assistance of any Court required to review the sentence upon appeal, it was incumbent upon his Honour to have articulated, at the time of passing sentence, the reasons for any doubts which he had, and to make clear and explicit his findings on the facts. This he regrettably and noticeably failed to do. The most which can be drawn from the reasons is that his Honour accepted that the minimum had been established consistent with the jury's verdict. 
     6 However, his Honour has since articulated, in a Report to the Court of Criminal Appeal, the reasons for the doubts which he had held in relation to the evidence of the victim and the other police witnesses, and for not imposing ""a more severe sentence"". 
     7 It would appear from this report that he formed a conclusion, in relation to the respondent's objective criminality, solely upon the basis of the evidence of the witnesses other than the victim, his wife, the police and members of their families, whose evidence he reported was ""almost totally lacking in credibility"". 
     8 The observations made in this report, concerning those witnesses, are of an extremely serious kind, so far as they involved conclusions that Senior Constable Swanston had behaved in ways which were ""highly provocative and offensively racist"", and that the ""police evidence gave the impression of having been fabricated in order to prejudice the respondents."" 
     9 The purpose of a Report to the Court of Criminal Appeal is not to justify or to explain why a Judge has dealt with a matter in a particular way. The proper place for the exposure of reasoning of this kind is in the Reasons for Sentence, and nowhere else. The reasons for that are obvious: 
      
      (a) the Reasons for Sentence are the published statement of the Court, addressed to the community at large, as well as to those immediately involved in the case, as to why an offender was dealt with in a particular way; 
       
      (b) the provision of an explanation directed to the Court of Criminal Appeal, after a sentence is handed down and an appeal is lodged, risks conveying an impression that the Judge, whose decision has been appealed, is seeking to justify or to support it. 
       
     10 An important function of a Report under s 11 of the Criminal Appeal Act is to inform the Court of Criminal Appeal of any problems which might have emerged during the trial, which either do not appear on the face of the record, or which are imperfectly or ambiguously recorded. 
     11 Another permissible and relevant function of such a Report is its use, by a trial Judge, to raise any matters of irregularity or otherwise, which may give cause for significant doubt in relation to a guilty verdict, and which again are not apparent upon a bare reading of the record. 
     12 A third permissible reason for such a Report is its provision, in response to a specific request from the Court of Criminal Appeal, in relation to any matter which may be of concern to it. 
     13 Otherwise, in times where there is in existence an adequate system for Court reporting, occasion for the provision of a s 11 Report should only arise in exceptional circumstances. Its use in order to justify, or to explain a decision for which reasons should have been provided, is not such a circumstance. 
     14 In the present case his Honour offered, as a reason for not having expressed the reasons for sentence more fully, his concern that to do so might inflame what appeared to be a situation of serious racial tension in Condobolin. That did not, in my view, constitute a sufficient reason for the course taken, particularly in circumstances where the trial had been heard in Parkes, more than five years after the date of the offence, where the victim had not returned to work as a police officer, and where only one of the four other police witnesses was still stationed at Condobolin. 
     15 Notwithstanding those considerations, and notwithstanding the difficult position in which the Crown and this Court are left, (the former because of the absence of any specific or timely indication of the full nature and extent of his Honour's concerns, to which the Crown Prosecutor might have responded) I consider it proper for this Report, now that it has been provided, to be taken into account. 
     16 That is the case because, without having had the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses, this Court is not in a position to come to any conclusion itself as to the circumstances in which the incident began, or as to whether anything was in fact done by the victim which bore on the assessment of the respondent's criminality. 
     17 I do, however, observe that some of the matters which were of apparent concern to his Honour arose out of the evidence concerning the behaviour of the respondent once he was taken into custody and not out of that related to the actual assault. I am, in these circumstances, left with a distinct and uncomfortable impression that an unfairness may have been occasioned to the police witnesses that cannot now be addressed. 
      
       
      Facts 
     18 However, all that we can do, I believe, is to approach the sentence upon the same basis as his Honour, namely by reference to the existence of those bare elements of the offence which were necessary for the jury verdict. That involves the existence of an assault committed in the following circumstances, namely that: 
      
      (a) at about 2am on 25 May 1996 Senior Constable Swanston remonstrated with a group of persons, including the respondent, who had gathered outside the Condobolin Hotel, where he had been drinking, and asked them to move on; 
       
      (b) when he was challenged as to what authority he had to make this request, he showed them his police badge; 
       
      (c) a confrontation developed between Senior Constable Swanston and the group, in the course of which there was some pushing and shoving and words were spoken; 
       
      (d) Senior Constable Swanston's wife, who had also come out of the hotel, became involved in an altercation with some of the women in the group, which left her with a serious injury; 
       
      (e) Senior Constable Swanston went over towards her, leading to the respondent and him “facing up”. At some stage he slipped to the ground whereupon the respondent and another man, Turner, repeatedly kicked him while he was lying defenceless on the ground, leaving him unconscious; 
       
      (f) when admitted to hospital Senior Constable Swanston was seen to have blood all over his face and considerable swelling and bruising. He was admitted to surgery under the care of a maxillo-facial surgeon who found that he had two black eyes and multiple fractures of his mid-face, including a broken nose, broken cheekbones and a displaced broken jaw. As a result of these injuries he has been rendered unfit to return to work as a police officer. 
       
     19 It was the respondent's case at trial, variously, that he had acted in self-defence in kicking Senior Constable Swanston once, that he had been mistakenly identified by those witnesses who said that he had been responsible for the other kicks, and that Senior Constable Swanston had behaved aggressively and in a manner not befitting an off duty police officer so far as he had taunted persons in the group or punched them. There was evidence called by the defence in support of these allegations, as well as evidence called by the prosecution refuting any such misconduct on the victim's part. 
     20 Despite the reservations which his Honour had about the manner in which the incident began and then evolved, he nevertheless classified the offence, of which the respondent was convicted, as ""a vicious crime which went beyond anything reasonably necessary for his own self-defence"", and as ""a vicious and extremely serious offence"". 
     21 In arriving at an appropriate sentence, his Honour paid express regard to that imposed by her Honour, Payne DCJ, upon the co-accused Turner. That was one of imprisonment for two years and eleven months to be served by way of periodic detention, with a non-parole period of seventeen months, taking into account a period of one month's pre-sentence custody. An offence of assault of one other man, arising out of the same incident, was taken into account on a Form 1. 
     22 By the time he appeared for sentence the respondent was aged twenty-nine years and had a number of convictions for the theft of motor vehicles, receiving, imposition, and offensive behaviour, as well as for assaults, one being an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He had served one term of imprisonment for the offence of imposition. 
     23 The Pre-sentence Report showed that he had been the victim of a neglected background, having received minimal care from his parents and having been fostered out at the age of six years. He had entered into several relationships as an adult which had been characterised by illicit substance abuse and by domestic violence.  
     24 In his twenties he had suffered adverse psychological reactions to his substance abuse, for which he was treated. After this, it was reported, he had refrained from drug use and had moderated his consumption of alcohol. He was planning to marry at the time of being sentenced, had worked as a builders' labourer and had experience as a trainee nurse. In that regard he had commenced but had not completed studies in Aboriginal Health Science. 
     25 The Pre-sentence Report suggested that he was a man who was able to control his aggressive nature when not experiencing frustrations. Conflict, however, triggered violent responses. The overall assessment was that he was not lacking a future and that with proper support and assistance there was reason to assume that he could control his behaviour. He expressed contrition in the sentencing proceedings so far as he apologised to the victim. 
      
       
      Submissions 
     26 The Crown submits that the sentence was manifestly lenient for an offence that had been categorised by his Honour as ""vicious and extremely serious"", such as to give rise to an error in law in that: 
      
      (a) the sentence imposed was not one that was commensurate with the objective gravity of the crime; 
       
      (b) insufficient weight had been given to the element of general deterrence, which was important in a case involving an assault of a victim who was known by the offender to be a police officer, albeit off duty, while he was attempting to enforce public order; 
       
      (c) the sentence did not adequately reflect the total criminality involved in the offence charged and the matters on the Form 1; and that 
       
      (d) an order for the sentence to be served by way of periodic detention involved an undue degree of leniency. 
       
     27 It is submitted on behalf of the respondent, by way of a reverse parity argument, that to now increase the sentence for the respondent would be to leave him with a sense of injustice, since: 
      
      (a) the culpability of each of the respondent and Turner was comparable; 
       
      (b) the difference in their subjective circumstances was adequately reflected by the lesser non-parole period given to Turner; and that 
       
      (c) the respondent had progressed well in terms of rehabilitation by the time at which he appeared for sentence. 
       
     28 It was further submitted that the objective seriousness of the offence was mitigated by the circumstances found by his Honour concerning the bearing which the victim's own conduct had in relation to the incident, that being a matter in respect of which the evidence before him was somewhat different from that before her Honour, Payne DCJ.  
     29 Finally, it was submitted that, since amendment of the legislation relating to periodic detention, which requires attention to be given to that option once a term of imprisonment has been selected, (R v Wegener (1999) NSWCCA 405); and the consequences which apply in the event of a failure to comply with such an order, the approach previously taken in relation to this form of sentencing option requires some qualification. 
      
       
      Conclusions 
     30 In my view insufficient weight was given to the gravity of the offence charged in the indictment. In R v Camilleri NSW CCA, 8 February 1990, Allen J (Gleeson CJ and Finlay J concurring) said: 
      
       
       ""In seeking to determine in any case the sentence appropriate to a particular crime, it is always of importance to have regard to the gravity of the offence viewed objectively. Unless that is done, the other factors requiring consideration in order to arrive at the proper sentence cannot be given their rightful place. A sentence imposed must be commensurate with the seriousness of the crime in the sense that it should, having regard to all the proved circumstances accord with the general moral sense of the community. It should also serve as a sufficient deterrent both to the offender and to others. The purpose of that deterrence is to prevent the commission of such offences and, whilst justice and humanity require that the previous character and conduct and the probable future life and conduct of the individual offender should be given the most careful consideration, those are factors which are necessarily subsidiary to the main consideration which determines the appropriate amount of punishment that is the protection of the public. The fundamental purpose of punishment is the protection of society.""

      R v Rushby 
       (1977) 1 NSWLR 594, and  
      R v Dodd 
       (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354 where similar observations were made by this Court. 
       
     31 It is important that sentencing judges maintain a reasonable proportionality between the need to impose sentences which serve to deter others from similar crimes and the need to temper the effect of such sentences with humanity. It is the former to which the latter is usually subsidiary, and persuasive subjective features must not be allowed to blind justice to the objective circumstances of the case. See R v Martin NSW CCA 19 March 1992. 
     32 It is this principle, which it appears to me that his Honour has overlooked, in insufficiently weighing the seriousness of an assault which he had otherwise characterised as “vicious”, and which involved a man being repeatedly kicked to the head while lying defenceless on the ground. Any concerns which his Honour held, in relation to the post-event remarks attributed by the police witnesses to the respondent, were of no relevance whatsoever, in that regard. 
     33 There are three other aspects which his Honour appears to have overlooked.  
     34 First, the courts have consistently stressed that there is a need to impose deterrent sentences upon those who assault police officers whilst discharging the duties of their office: See R v Myers NSW CCA 13 February 1990; R v Cheng, NSW CCA 30 September 1994; and R v Stone (1995) 84 A Crim R 218 at 225. There is no reason to distinguish between police who have been formally rostered on duty and those who, although off duty, seek to exercise their policing powers in order to arrest an offender or to maintain public order. His Honour at best paid lip service to this principle. 
     35 Secondly, in cases where an offender has committed more than one offence, the ultimate sentence imposed must reflect the totality of the criminality involved both in relation to the offence charged, as well as any matters included in a Form 1. While the other offences in this case arose out of the same incident, they were not trivial in that the respondent struck one of the other victims in the face and kicked the other man several times in the chest. The fact that such offences have been ""taken into account"" does not mean that only very little by way of additional penalty should be imposed in relation to the total sentence: See R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 at 372.36 Thirdly, periodic detention has been recognised as having a strong element of built in leniency. It is less severe in its denunciation of crime than a sentence involving full time custody: See R v Hallocoglu (1992) 63 A Crim R 287 at 292-294, particularly having regard to the way in which it has been administered. Such a sentence conveys little by way of deterrence and insufficient by way of punishment for an assault that left the victim with very serious injuries having lasting and serious consequences. This was not, in my view, an appropriate case for the option of periodic detention having regard to the objective seriousness of the offence of which the respondent was convicted. 
     37 Yet another further error in his Honour's approach to sentencing is apparent on the face of the reasons in that a finding of special circumstances was made without any reasons given for that finding, and without any basis for it being apparent on the face of the record. 
     38 So far as the question of parity is concerned, it is the fact that the co-offender Turner was considerably younger and had only one prior entry for a relatively minor matter which had been dealt with by way of a recognisance. He had never previously served any sentence of imprisonment and he had found the short period of pre-sentence custody to be a salutary experience. Moreover, he had pleaded guilty upon arraignment whereupon the respondent had elected to go to trial. Those matters would have justified the respondent being dealt with on a significantly different basis to Turner. 
      
       
      Discretion 
     39 Since I am satisfied that the Crown has established material errors of law in the several respects identified, it is next necessary to determine whether the Court should or should not should intervene. 
     40 The proper approach, that is to be taken in relation to a Crown appeal, is settled. First, a Court of Criminal Appeal which is dealing with an appeal against sentence does not simply embark upon a process of sentencing afresh, substituting its own opinion for that of the sentencing Judge, and increasing the sentence if it considers it to have been inadequate.  
     41 Secondly, this Court exercises a restraint in relation to Crown appeals, not only by reason of the discretion which has long been recognised, but also by reason of the principle of double jeopardy. That principle has particular importance when an offender has already been released from custody and has resumed his place in the community and is on the way to rehabilitation. It is also relevant where the sentencing order is one which does not involve full time custody, since to send an offender subject to periodic or home detention to prison on a full time basis can involve considerable hardship, and can interfere with rehabilitation. 
     42 Having regard to the view which I believe the Court should take in relation to this appeal, I consider it appropriate to have regard to the additional material provided to us this morning. Apart from a series of testimonials concerning the respondent, his own affidavit does throw some light on the question of discretion and double jeopardy. 
     43 Inter alia it indicates that he does have a supporting family in the community, that he has been undertaking some form of work, although the extent to which he has been able to do so has been affected by the fact that he has been held in limbo pending the hearing of this appeal. It appears that he does have a continuing relationship with his family and he has stayed out of trouble over the period since he was sentenced. 
     44 During that period, as I have observed he has commenced to perform the periodic detention, and if this Court declines to interfere, then he will be expected to continue to serve the balance of that sentence and to face the consequences should he fail to perform his obligations. 
     45 A further matter of relevance is that this is a matter which is affected by delay. As I observed the offence occurred as far back as 1996. It is true that a significant aspect of that delay is to be sheeted home to the respondent since he failed to appear for trial before her Honour, Payne DCJ, when he was due to appear in the District Court. However, it seems that he has been brought before the Court on a number of subsequent occasions to be dealt with for other offences. Why it is that a warrant was not issued or executed so as to bring him to trial in a timely way has not been explained.  
     46 It is always difficult for this Court to deal with a matter which has a delay of a kind which is here present, particularly where, as I observed, rehabilitation has commenced. 
     47 Having regard to these very special circumstances, while I am well satisfied that his Honour failed to carry out his duty in this case, it is my view that this Court should exercise its discretion and decline to interfere. 
     48 For those reasons I would that propose that the appeal be dismissed. 
     49 STUDDERT J: I agree. 
     50 BELL J: I also agree. 
     51 WOOD CJ AT CL: The order of the Court will be as I have proposed.

       REGINA V MIKHAIL EDIGAROV 
        
        
       Judgment 
        
       
     1 WOOD CJ at CL: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act (NSW) 1912, in respect of sentences imposed by Mahoney DCJ in the Sydney District Court on 19 April 2001. On that occasion his Honour had two separate series of offences to deal with, each arising out of violence directed by the respondent towards his wife.  
      
       
      OFFENCES OF 3 AUGUST 1999  
     2 On this day the respondent assaulted his wife in the presence of their three year old daughter, by pushing her against a refrigerator, and by pursuing her into the bedroom, where he seized her by the head and pushed her to the floor. After throwing and kicking articles around the bedroom he left the premises. His wife and young daughter went to a friend's unit for safety. He arrived there an hour or so later and forced his way into the bedroom where she was hiding. He demanded that she return home and threatened to kill her. After a struggle he was ejected from the unit. However, he remained outside yelling for his wife to come out and banging on the door.  
     3 Police were called to deal with the situation. When he attempted to push past them, to get to his wife, attempts were made to arrest him. In the course of doing so, one of the officers involved, Constable Ian Ward, who was trying to handcuff him and place him into the back of a police wagon, was pushed. He lost his footing and fell to the ground. As a result of this fall he suffered serious fractures to his lower leg and ankle. Three other police were also assaulted by the respondent before they were able to effect his arrest.  
     4 Arising out of these incidents, the respondent was charged with the following offences: 
      
       (a) Common assault of his wife (s 61 of the Crimes Act 1900 for which a maximum penalty of imprisonment for two years is prescribed).  
       
       (b) Assault police officer in the execution of his duty, thereby occasioning him actual bodily harm (S 60(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 for which a maximum penalty of imprisonment for seven years is prescribed).  
       
     5 To these offences he pleaded guilty upon the date fixed for his trial, namely 5 March 2001. Four other offences involving the assault of police officers in the execution of their duty, with intent to resist arrest (s 58 of the Crimes Act (NSW) 1900 for which a maximum penalty of five years is prescribed) were taken into account on a form 1.  
     6 Unfortunately, neither the record, or the reasons for sentence, indicate in respect of which of those two counts the form 1 matters were taken into account. In some ways the observations made by his Honour tend to suggest that he regarded it is as appropriate to take them into them account in relation to both counts. If so that would have been impermissible. Whatever happened there does appear to have been procedural error in relation to this aspect of the case. 
     7 Following upon these events, and pending the sentence, the respondent was released to bail and became the subject of an apprehended domestic violence order, which was obtained in the Local Court, upon his wife's application, on 5 July 2000.  
      
       
      OFFENCE OF 7 OCTOBER 2000  
     8 Upon this day the respondent kidnapped his wife while she was walking along the street with her daughter. This he achieved by forcing her into the boot of his motor vehicle, which he closed, despite the discomfort and humiliation of being treated in this way, and despite the fact that the day was very hot, with the temperature being in the thirties. The child was placed in the passenger space of the vehicle. 
     9 While in the boot she endeavoured to use her mobile phone to obtain help. The respondent threatened to kill her if she continued to use the phone. When she began to call out for help he turned up the volume of the car radio so as to drown out her cries. At some stage she managed to contact a friend whom she asked to contact the police. In fact they had been alerted earlier by a bystander who had observed the kidnapping and taken down the registration number of the respondent's vehicle.  
     10 Upon arriving at the home of his parents the respondent repeatedly punched and kicked his wife and pushed her head against a wall. She suffered cuts and abrasions to her feet and left knee; bruising to her left knee and right shoulder; grazes to her right elbow, neck, back and shoulder, and an injury to at least one finger on her right hand and possibly to two fingers. 
     11 She eventually managed to escape to a neighbouring unit where she contacted police. By the time the police and an ambulance arrived the respondent had left the scene. However, later that day he surrendered himself. When interviewed he made admissions as to the commission of the offence, although asserting that the degree of violence involved was not as great as that alleged by the victim, and also suggesting that his intention had only been to take her to his parent’s place so that he could talk to her about their relationship.  
     12 He was then taken into custody where he remained bail refused until he was sentenced on 19 April 2001 (by which time a period of six months and 12 days had passed).  
     13 He pleaded guilty to the offence of kidnapping, for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 20 years, in the Local Court. He adhered to that plea in the District Court. 
      
       
      THE SENTENCES  
     14 The sentences imposed by his Honour were as follows:  
      
       (a) common assault of his wife - Six months imprisonment from 7 October 2000 to 6 April 2001; 
       
      (b) assault police officer occasioning actual bodily harm - Imprisonment for 18 months to commence on 7 October 2000 and to expire on 6 April 2002, suspended upon the condition that he enter into a good behaviour bond for the term of the sentence; 
       
      (c) kidnapping - Imprisonment for two years to commence from 7 October 2000 and to expire on 6 October 2002, with a non parole period of six months and 12 days, also commencing from 7 October 2000, and expiring on the day on which sentence was pronounced, namely 19 April 2001.  
       
     15 In imposing the sentence for kidnapping his Honour found that there were special circumstances in that all of the offences of the respondent were ""by-products of (his) anger and frustration and disappointment at the failure of (his) marriage and at the imposition of the apprehended violence order against (him)"".  
     16 The net result was that, for this series of offences, the respondent was required to serve a custodial term of six months and 12 days and to be to be subject to supervision, upon parole, for the balance of the sentence for the kidnap offence. (ie in round terms, a further period of 18 months); and, to be subject to the possibility of being called up in relation to the suspended sentence, (for a period in round terms of 12 months from the date of his release to parole for the kidnap offence).  
      
       
      THE APPEAL  
     17 The Director of Public Prosecutions signed a notice of appeal on 30 May 2001, which was served upon the respondent on 1 June 2001. He has in the meantime continued to live in the community without re-offending.  
     18 It is the Crown submission, in summary, that there were five identifiable errors in the sentencing exercise undertaken by his Honour, leaving aside any procedural error related to the form 1 matters, namely that:  
      
       (a) The suspended sentence was imposed in breach of s 12(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, since the order for suspension was made in circumstances where the respondent was subject to another sentence of imprisonment which had not itself been suspended.  
       
      (b) His Honour failed to give sufficient weight to the objective seriousness of the combination of offences involved;  
       
      (c) His Honour failed, in relation to the kidnap offence, to give sufficient weight to the aggravating circumstances that it was committed while the respondent was upon bail and also while he was subject to an apprehended violence order which had been granted for the protection of the victim;  
       
       (d) The overall sentencing order displayed such a degree of leniency as to demonstrate error of law; and 
       
      (e) The factors identified as special circumstances justifying a departure from the ratio between the non parole period and the head sentence specified by s 44(2) of the Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 did not qualify as such. 
       
     19 The respondent submitted, in reply to these submissions, that the sentences imposed were not, in the circumstances of the case, manifestly lenient, and alternatively, that if error of law was displayed, either in relation to the suspended sentence or otherwise, this Court should not, in the exercise of its discretion, or by reference to the principles of double jeopardy, intervene so as to return the respondent into custody. 20 In particular it was submitted:  
      
      (a) It was not clear that the order to suspend the sentence for the assault of the police officer was in breach of s 12(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999;  
       
      (b) the objective seriousness of the offence for which the suspended sentence was imposed was reduced by the circumstance that the police officer's injury arose as the result of an accident rather than as the result of deliberate intention on the respondent's part to occasion him harm;  
       
       c) the assault of the respondent's wife and the kidnap needed to be assessed in the context of the respondent's adverse psychological reaction to their marital problems and, in particular, his resentment at having been rejected after working extremely hard to bring her parents to Australia. It has been further submitted, in that regard, that he was over-tired, confused or otherwise mentally less responsible for his acts than otherwise might have been the case;  
       
      (d) the various offences involved in the assault of the police officers were properly to be considered as part of a single episode of criminality;  
       
      (e) for the kidnap offence the respondent was entitled to the benefit of the utilitarian value of the plea, in respect of which the strength of the Crown case had no relevance; 
       
      (f) the experience of having served six months in custody during which time the respondent had undergone an anger management course, was sufficient by way of punishment and personal deterrence for him, particularly as he had never previously served a custodial sentence; and 
       
      (g) to return him to custody would be counter-productive to the interests of securing the respondent's rehabilitation and reconciliation to his current situation.  
       
     21 The subjective circumstances, as found by his Honour, are relevant for the determination of this appeal. In summary they reveal that the respondent was aged 30 years when he appeared for sentence. He had been born in Djagistan and came to Australia in 1992 at the age of 22 years. His wife joined him here shortly before their marriage in 1995. They had one child in 1996 and separated in August 1999 following a period of marital disharmony.  
     22 In his home country he had been trained as a food technician and had seen military service. In Australia he had been employed as a process worker and part time taxi driver and he had been working long hours to earn sufficient money in order to support his wife and to bring her parents to Australia.  
     23 A report supplied by a clinical psychologist, Warwick John Taylor, for sentencing purposes, suggested that he had some passive-aggressive characteristics in his personality adjustment, was lacking in significant insight, and had a reasonably low predisposition to re-offending, but needed psychotherapy and supervision in order to gain a greater degree of understanding of himself and to assist in developing more adequate emotional and behavioural controls. He was not found to be suffering from any significant emotional disturbance or personality disorder.  
     24 He had no prior criminal record of any relevance save for one earlier conviction for the contravention of an apprehended violence order. In his favour was the fact that he surrendered himself to police after the October 2000 offence, and the fact he had undergone an anger management course while waiting for sentence.  
     25 Notwithstanding the very careful and comprehensive submissions of Mr Craigie SC, for the respondent, I am of the view the Crown appeal has been made good.  
      
      (a) Suspension of the sentence for the assault occasioning actual bodily harm.  
       
     26 By s 12(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 it is provided that an order suspending a sentence: 
      
       
        
        ""may not be made in relation to a sentencing of imprisonment if the offender is subject to some other sentence of imprisonment that is not the subject of such an order.""  
        
       
     27 As has already been noted, the suspended sentence was here imposed so as to take effect, in the first place, concurrently with the period during which the respondent was to be taken as having been in custody serving the sentences for the assault of his wife, and for the kidnapping of her, and also as to take effect, in the second place, concurrently with the period during which he was directed to be released upon parole for the kidnapping offence.  
     28 The submission advanced by Mr Craigie SC was to the effect that the section should be given a beneficial interpretation, at least in relation to the second of these periods, on the basis that the prohibition was intended to take effect only in relation to any part of another sentence which required the offender to serve time in prison. If that was so then, it was submitted, the prohibition would not apply to the period when the offender was subject to release on parole in respect of another sentence.  
     29 In my view this argument faces two difficulties. The first arises by reason of s 132 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 which provides that: ""An offender who, while serving a sentence, is released on parole in accordance with the terms of a parole order is taken to continue to serve the sentence during the period:  
      
      (a) that begins when the offender is released, and  
       
      (b) that ends when the sentence expires or (if the parole order is sooner, revoked) when the parole order is revoked."" 
       
        
     30 While it was submitted that this provision is merely a deeming provision for a particular purpose related to the administration of sentences, and should not be given any wider effect, that submission cannot, in my view, be made good. The Act within which it is contained must be regarded as cognate legislation for the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In accordance with well established principles of statutory interpretation it is permissible to refer to cognate legislation as far as that may throw light on any ambiguity.  
     31 Secondly, the interpretation suggested would require the prohibition to operate in escrow to be reactivated if, and when, the parole for the other sentence was revoked thereby returning the offender to custody. I do not consider that the legislation contemplated or intended such an ambulatory operation of s 12(2).  
     32 Rather, it appears to me, it was intended to preclude suspension of a sentence during such time as any other sentence was in force which was expressed to be one of imprisonment, both during its parole and non parole phases. 
     33 Reference to other portions of legislation does not really assist in the resolution of this question. As far as the researches of counsel have shown the only provision in the Act which provides a definition, of a “sentence of imprisonment” is s 55(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which in the following terms:  
      
       
       ""In this section, a reference to a sentence of imprisonment is taken to be a reference to:  
        
       a) the non parole period of the sentence, in the case of a sentence for which a non parole period has been set, or  
        
       (b) the term of the sentence, in the case of a sentence for which a non parole period has not been set."" 
       
     34 It appears to me, however, that this provision is intended to take effect for the limited purpose of that section. Indeed, the fact that the legislature saw it appropriate to give a special meaning to the expression in this context tends to support the contrary interpretation which I favour.  
     35 That interpretation I observe also has the support of dicta in the case of R v Gangee [2001] NSWCCA 251 in the judgment of Sully J. His Honour was in the minority in that case but the proposition with which he dealt was not the subject of consideration by the other members of the Court. In his judgment, at paragraph 9, his Honour indicated that “the term of the sentence properly related to the overall sentence of imprisonment (that is what used to be called the head sentence)”.  
     36 That view of his Honour's accords with the interpretation which I favour.  
     37 In any event, even if there were merit in the submission, it does not meet the difficulty that the suspended sentence was directed to commence at a time when the respondent was, by virtue of the backdating, to be taken as a matter of law, to be serving two other sentences of custodial detention for the assault and kidnapping respectively, of his wife.  
     38 Error of law has accordingly been shown in relation to this aspect of the sentence.  
     39 Independently and additionally I am persuaded that the sentence imposed failed to give sufficient weight to the objective seriousness of the offences, and that too much significance was attached to the emotional reaction of the respondent to being thwarted in the marriage, a circumstance that provided no excuse whatsoever for his behaviour.  
      
       
      ASSAULT OF RESPONDENT'S WIFE 
     40 The initial assault on his wife involved the respondent terrorising her by the sustained use of physical violence, in the presence of an equally terrified small child. It could not be characterised as a momentary or uncharacteristic loss of self-control, as his aggression continued until later in the evening and was accompanied by threats by him to kill his wife.  
     41 As this Court has confirmed in Glen NSWCCA 19 December 1994, Ross NSWCCA 20 November 1996, Rowe (1996) 89 A Crim R 467, Fahda (1999) NSWCCA 267 and Powell (2000) NSWCCA 108, violent attacks in domestic settings must be treated with real seriousness. Regrettably, that form of conduct involves aggression by men who are physically stronger than their victims and who are often in a position economically, or otherwise, to enforce their silence and their acceptance of such conduct. In truth such conduct is brutal, cowardly and inexcusable, and the Courts have a duty to ensure that it is adequately punished, and that sentences are handed out which have a strong element of personal and general deterrence.  
      
       
      ASSAULT OF CONSTABLE WARD  
     42 Next, in relation to the 1999 matters, it has also been made abundantly clear by this Court that offences involving the assault of police officers, in the execution of their duty, are to be regarded as serious offences requiring a significant element of deterrence (see R v Stone (1996) 84 A Crim R 218; Myers NSWCCA 13 February 1990, and Nasif NSWCCA 10 March 1995.)  
     43 While it may be accepted that the actual injury sustained by Constable Ward was unintended, and somewhat freakish, there is always a risk of an officer being injured if he or she is subjected to actual physical force in an attempt to resist arrest. That the precise consequences were unexpected does not operate as an excuse, or as an answer, for such conduct. It may mean that the offender's objective criminality is somewhat less than it would otherwise have been, but nevertheless any such offence remains objectively serious. 
     44 The criminality involved in this assault was, in my view, such, notwithstanding the respondent's emotional state and his plea of guilty, that it was one that was inappropriately dealt with by way of a suspended sentence.  
     45 In that regard it also appears to me that it would have been appropriate for his Honour to have taken into account, in dealing with any offence, the matters included in the form 1. If that were the case then it was important that his Honour not overlook the principles enunciated by this Court when Hunt CJ at CL, in R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368, stated that the fact that offences are taken into account does not mean that only very little by way of additional penalty should be imposed in respect of those matters, (providing, of course, that the penalty does not exceed the maximum penalty that could have been imposed had the offences not been taken into account).  
     46 The view which I have reached as to leniency of this sentence, is formed irrespective of whether or not it was the offence in respect of which the form 1 matters were included. 
      
       
      KIDNAPPING  
     47 Turning to the kidnapping, it is important to note that the available maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years, indicates the seriousness with which the legislature views this offence.  
     48 The kidnapping here involved sustained violence by the respondent who caused substantial injury to his wife and again threatened to kill her. Yet again this offence was carried out in the presence of their young daughter and in circumstances of great indignity, so far as the victim was bundled into the boot of a motor vehicle and driven off without any consideration of her safety, for the selfish purposes of the respondent. On any view it must have been a terrifying situation for her.  
     49 I observe there was some issue before his Honour at trial as to whether or not the respondent either had in his possession, or used a weapon in connection with this offence. The matter was left equivocal by his Honour when sentencing the respondent and the material before us does not allow us to reach a view one way or the other about it. The appropriate course, I believe, is to place that factor aside.  
     50 In the case of this offence, however, there were three significant aggravating factors which should have been reflected in the sentence:  
      
      (a) This was not an isolated act of violence since the respondent was already awaiting trial for an earlier assault upon the same victim, that being an offence to which he ultimately pleaded guilty;  
       
      (b) it was committed while he was on bail for that offence; a matter said in  
      R v Readman  
      (1990) 47 A Crim R 181, and repeated more than once by this Court –see eg  
      R v Lardner  
      NSWCCA 10 September 1998 to be a matter of aggravation; and  
       
      (c) it was committed while he was subject to an apprehended violence order in relation to the same victim.  
       
     51 These circumstances, and the objective seriousness of the offence, in my view, inevitably required the imposition of a sentence which was accumulative upon the sentences for the earlier episode of criminality. Absent an accumulation the overall sentence failed, in my view, to reflect the elements of punishment and deterrence which were called for.  
      
       
      SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES 
     52 The finding of special circumstances was related to the fact the offence of kidnapping was seen to be a “by-product of the respondent's anger, frustration and disappointment in relation to the breakdown of the marriage and the imposition of an apprehended violence order”. That finding was, in my view, unjustified in law. The special circumstances, of which the section speaks, are those which are related to the need to reduce the proportion between the head sentence and the non parole period, in most cases being referable to the need for an extended period of post release supervision, or for access to some form of treatment which is not readily available within the prison system. The purpose in each case is to foster rehabilitation and a lawful return of the offender to the community. (See Moffitt (1990) 20 NSWLR 114 and Silver (1999) NSWCCA 108. 
     53 It is not appropriate to give a double discount, by treating as special circumstances, those objective or subjective considerations which otherwise justify leniency in relation to the head sentence. See Kama (2000) 110 A Crim R 47, and Lett NSWCCA 27 February 1995, where Hunt CJ at CL said:  
      
       
       ""What constitutes special circumstances is 
         
       something more than those matters which may be taken into account by way of mitigation of the total sentence. If it were otherwise, there would be no need for the adjective 'special' and no need for s 5(2) at all. Sometimes, the combination of those circumstances may be sufficient:  
       R v GDR  
       (1994) 35 NSWLR 376; 75 A Crim R 319 at 3-4. But what must be shown are circumstances which demonstrate the need or the desirability for the offender to be subjected to an extended period of conditional release subject to supervision on parole.""  
       
     54 The result of these various matters was to produce an effective sentencing order which, in my view, did not reflect the objective seriousness of the total criminality involved, and in which the respondent's subjective circumstances were allowed inappropriately to outweigh the objective criminality of the case, contrary to the principles in R v Rushby (1977) 1 NSWLR 594 and R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 
      
       
      DOUBLE JEOPARDY AND DISCRETION 
     55 Notwithstanding the discretion which is properly reserved to sentencing judges, concerning the way in which they are entitled to treat the facts and circumstances of a particular case, (see R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 511) and that which is reserved to Courts of Criminal Appeal in relation to Crown appeals, the degree of discrepancy between the sentences which were imposed, and those which should have been imposed, in this case were, in my view, such that this Court should intervene (see Moffitt (1990) 20 NSWLR 114 at 129.)  
     56 It is, however, necessary to give proper weight to the principle of double jeopardy and to substitute, for those sentences which are set aside, sentences towards the lower range of those properly available (See Griffiths v The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 293, R v Warfield NSWCCA 24 June 1994, and Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 115 A Crim R 558.) That has particular relevance in a case where the Court's intervention would have the result of returning an offender to custody, with the possible adverse effects that may have upon his or her rehabilitation.  
     57 It is also necessary to have regard to the additional material which was provided by the respondent in the form of two affidavits from his parents; in the form of reports from Dr Carne, from the Probation and Parole Service, as well as a document which takes the form of a victim impact statement, although it possibly goes beyond the usual reach of such a document.  
     58 It is necessary to do so because the Court must re-sentence in the light of the respondent's current circumstances (see Allpass).  
     59 The material from his parents tends to suggest the respondent has become more accepting of the need to avoid contact with his wife and child and that he has become somewhat more settled since being sentenced. The remainder of the material, however, places a substantial or qualification upon that view.  
     60 Dr Carne, in his report noted the respondent's reluctance and irritation at being required to revisit the matter. He expressed the opinion that his behaviour was consistent with that of a rejected stalker and, in particular, with that of a male with narcissistic personality traits, which he considered him to display. While Dr Carne did not consider him to be suffering from any form of mental illness, his personality he thought was such that he was still finding it difficult to come to terms with the loss of his relationship. As such he thought he would benefit from returning to work and undertaking suitably focused counselling. A further period in custody, he thought, may cause him to dwell on the breakdown of the relationship and to hinder access to appropriate counselling.  
     61 The Probation and Parole report evidences concern as to the extent to which the respondent has come to accept the situation or to gain any real insight into that offence. In particular it notes that he has rejected any approach that he be referred to specialist counselling. It also notes that he has asserted that he would never stop looking for his wife and he believes that someone must pay for what has happened to his life. The author of the report concluded that the respondent presented as a disturbed and angry man, who used threatening and violent language and whose expressions of revenge evoked concerns for his former wife.  
     62 These matters, I stress, do not justify preventive detention but they are relevant for an assessment of the progress which the respondent has, or has not, made towards rehabilitation, and also as to whether he has developed any real insight into his problems.  
     63 I find on the material available that his insight is limited and that his progress towards rehabilitation is limited. I come to this conclusion taking into account, in fairness to the respondent, on the other side of the coin, the fact that since his release on 20 April 2001 he has been subject to the restraints of a bond and parole order and has not re-offended in relation to his ex-wife. That circumstance does need to be understood in the context of the arrangements which have been made for her protection in consequence of which he does not know where she is living. 
     64 It is always difficult and potentially harsh, and this Court derives no satisfaction from the need to return offenders to prison, when Crown appeals against sentence are brought, for the reasons expressed in R v Tindle NSWCCA 8 October 1998 and R v Chad NSWCCA 13 May 1997. It is for this reason that the Court has cautioned, more than once in recent times, that sentencing judges who extend appellable leniency to an offender do not do them any favour: In that regard see the observations of Mason P in R v Horne (1999) NSWCCA 391 and of Grove J in R v Webster (1999) NSWCCA 313. 
     65 However, taking all those matters into account I do consider it necessary to allow the appeal and to re-sentence the respondent in relation to the offences of assault of the police officer occasioning actual bodily harm, and in relation to the offence of kidnap.66 STUDDERT J: I agree. 
     67 BELL J: I agree.  
      
       
       (Mr Craigie addressed the Court on re-sentencing and discussion as to a fresh form 1 being signed.) (The Court adjourned briefly to enable Mr Craigie to discuss the above matters with the respondent.) 
        
       (On resumption Mr Craigie stated he had given advice. However, the respondent did not feel able to accept the advice and would not execute the form 1. In response to the Court Mr Craigie advised he had informed the respondent of the consequences of not signing the form 1. 
       
       
       Respondent to be dealt with on the basis of sentencing for the two assaults without the form 1 taken into account.) 
       
     68 WOOD CJ at CL: Following advice given the respondent has declined to sign the form 1, with the consequence that he is not entitled to have the four offences of assault police taken into account when being sentenced.  
     69 For the reasons I have already given, and taking into account the matter just mentioned, I would propose that the Crown appeal be dismissed, so far as it relates to the sentence for the assault of the respondent's wife, that is the sentence of the six months imprisonment from 7 October 2000 to 6 April 2001, being a sentence already served.  
     70 I propose that the appeal be allowed in relation to the sentence for the assault of Constable Ward and that there be substituted therefor a fixed term of imprisonment for six months to commence from today. That sentence I would fix by way of an effective accumulation of six months upon the sentence for the offence of the assault committed against the respondent's wife. I would decline to set any non parole period for it by reference to the sentence I next propose.  
     71 I propose that the appeal be allowed in relation to the sentence for the kidnap of his wife and I would substitute therefor a sentence of imprisonment for two years and six months to date from today and to expire on 4 April 2004, such sentence to be served partly concurrently and partly cumulatively upon the last mentioned sentence. I would specify a non parole period of 18 months, similarly to commence today and to expire on 4 April 2003. I would direct the respondent's release, at the end of that period, on parole subject to supervision by the Probation and Parole Service and also subject to standard conditions prescribed by the regulations under the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 as well as subject to a condition that he undertake counselling in relation to his problems of anger management and in relation to such other problems, as might still be present, as directed by the Probation and Parole Service.  
     72 I specify that, in imposing these sentences, I have taken into account the pleas of guilty for their utilitarian value for which I conclude that he was entitled to a discount in the order of 15 per cent.  
     73 I find special circumstances exist, not for the reason found by Judge Mahoney, but having regard to the fact that now the respondent is to be taken back into custody, pursuant to the orders which I propose, he would need a longer period than that allowed by the statutory proportion for supervision, so as to ease his return back into the community.  
     74 I observe that the sentences which I have proposed are substantially less than those which I consider should have been imposed at first instance. This is a consequence of the principle of double jeopardy.  
     75 STUDDERT J: I agree with the Chief Judge at Common Law.  
     76 BELL J: I also agree.  
     77 WOOD CJ at CL: The orders of the Court will, therefore, be as I have proposed.

       R v. Lube BUJAROSKI 
        
        
       Judgment 
       
     1 HODGSON JA: On 7th December 2000, after a joint trial before Twigg DCJ and a jury lasting nine days, Marilyn Scheidel was found guilty of fraudulently misappropriating the sum of $65,000.00 in violation of the terms on which it was received by her; and the appellant was found guilty of aiding, abetting, counselling and procuring this felony.  
     2 On 21st January 2001, the trial judge sentenced Ms. Scheidel to imprisonment for two years, with eighteen months non-parole period, and the appellant to three years’ imprisonment with two years three months non-parole period, both to be served by way of periodic detention. 
     3 We are dealing with an appeal by the appellant against his conviction, and an application by him for leave to appeal against the sentence.  
     4 Before considering the grounds of appeal and submissions, it is convenient to outline certain undisputed facts relevant to the questions that we have to decide. 
     5 Prior to 31st May 1996, the appellant had negotiated with one Paul Aslemoski for a loan of $65,000.00. The appellant’s co-accused Ms. Scheidel was a solicitor who participated in the transaction on behalf of the appellant. Another solicitor Malcolm Hansen acted on behalf of Mr. Aslemoski. 
     6 At about 11am on 31st May 1996, the appellant saw Ms. Scheidel at her office in relation to the transaction, and subsequently on the same day, Ms. Scheidel drew a document for the purposes of satisfying the requirements of the lender in relation to the transaction. This document was in the following terms: 
      
       
        
        DEED OF GUARANTEE 
         
        This deed of guarantee is made on the 31 day of May 1996 
         
        BETWEEN LUBE BUJAROSKI AND PAUL ASLEMOSKI. 
         
        Lube Bujaroski hereby agrees to guarantee to pay Paul Aslemoski that the sum of $65,000.00 being funds provided by Paul Aslemoski to Lube Bujaroski for the purposes of investment. Such funds will remain in Lube Bujaroskis Solicitors Trust Account. Lube Bujaroski also agrees to pay Paul Aslemoski the sum of $10,000.00 as payment to Paul Aslemoski for providing the funds to Lube Bujaroski. It is further agreed that the $10,000.00 will also be placed in the Solicitors Trust Account. The above funds being $75,000.00 will not be released from the Trust Account unless Lube Bujaroski has an acceptable Bank Letter of Credit. The total funds will be released to Paul Aslemoski at the end of the four (4) week period.  
         
         
        It is further agreed that this agreement is limited to the sum of $75,000.00 and is for a period of four (4) weeks from the date of this Agreement. 
         
         
        Signed by Lube Bujaroski:  
         
        Witness: 
        
       
     7 A copy of this document was faxed to Mr. Hansen at 3.02pm on that day, under the cover of a letter from Ms. Scheidel in the following terms: 
      
       
        
        AGREEMENT BETWEEN PAUL ASLEMOSKI AND LUBE BUJAROSKI 
         
        Please find attached a deed of agreement between my client Lube Bujaroski and your client Paul Aslemoski for the loan and investment of $65,000.00. As can be seen from the agreement, your client will receive the fee of $10,000.00 for the loan of the above funds. 
         
         
        The funds (being both $65,000.00 and $10,000.00) will be lodged in our Solicitor’s Trust Account at the ANZ Bank. We hereby guarantee that as per the agreement, the funds will not be released until my client has an acceptable Bank Letter of Credit or until after the period of four weeks from the date of the Agreement. 
        
       
     8 Meanwhile, it seems that the appellant had received by facsimile from Thailand a document apparently on the letterhead of an entity described as The Commercial Trading Bank of Dubai Limited, purporting to be a “Stand-by Letter of Credit” in favour of a company associated with the appellant, in the sum of $US500,000.00 with a “maturity date” of 21st June 1996. 
     9 Shortly before 3.30pm on 31st May 1996, the appellant returned to Ms. Scheidel’s office with this document, and spoke to Ms. Scheidel. At about 3.30pm, Ms. Scheidel began a long consultation with another client on a family law matter, which continued until about 5.30pm.  
     10 At 3.41pm, a letter was sent by facsimile from Mr. Hansen to Ms. Scheidel in the following terms: 
      
       
        
        RE: ASLEMOSKI AND LUBE BUJAROSKI 
         
        We thank you for your letter of 31 May 1996, directed to our client. Regarding the Deed of Guarantee we insist however that the moneys paid by our client is to be placed in your trust account not Lube Bujaroskis Solicitors Trust Account. Therefore we will require a receipt from Marilyn J. Scheidel & Associates Solicitors Trust Account for the sum of $65,000.00. That moneys will ofcourse(sic) remain in your trust account until that sum together with the sum of $10,000.00 is paid to our client. 
         
         
        In addition when our client receives your trust account receipt we will also require from your firm a written undertaking from your firm that the sum of $65,000.00 will remain in your trust account not to be released to anyone except to our client. 
         
         
        We await your client’s instructions in that regard. 
        
       
     11 It seems clear that Ms. Scheidel interrupted her consultation with the other client to make alterations to the original draft, following the receipt of that fax. The only alteration made at that stage was to substitute for the words “Lube Bujarovski’s Solicitors Trust Account” the words “Marilyn J. Scheidel & Associates (Solicitors) Trust Account held at the ANZ Bank in Canberra”. The document was thus altered was then signed by the appellant and witnessed by Ms. Scheidel, and a copy was faxed to Mr. Hansen at 3.50pm. 
     12 At about 4.15pm, Mr. Hansen faxed a further letter to Ms. Scheidel, in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
        RE ASLEMOSKI AND LUBE BUJAROSKI 
         
        We thank you for the amended deed of guarantee however for the sake of completeness we would be pleased if it could read after “the above funds being $75,000.00 …” or part thereof will not be released from the trust account in any event and shall be released to Paul Aslemoski and no other person at the end of the four (4) week period.  
         
         
        Upon the deed of guarantee showing that amendment we will contact our client with a view to possibly releasing the funds required by your client.  
         
         
        In addition ofcourse (sic) we will require the signed undertaking by your firm as alluded to in our previous letter of today’s date. 
        
       
     13 It seems clear that Ms. Scheidel again interrupted her conference, and again altered the deed of guarantee on her computer, by substituting the following sentence for the last sentence in the first substantive paragraph of the document:  
      
       
        
        The above funds being $75,000.00 or part thereof will not be released from the Trust Account in any event and shall be released to Paul Aslemoski and to no other person at the end of the four (4) week period. 
        
       
     14 This altered document was signed by the appellant and witnessed, not by Ms. Scheidel, but by Mr. Wilson, a solicitor employed in Ms. Scheidel’s office; and a copy of the signed document was faxed to Mr. Hansen at 4.23pm. 
     15 Thereafter the appellant and Mr. Wilson went to Mr. Hansen’s office and collected a cheque for $65,000.00, and they then went to the bank and deposited this money in Marilyn Scheidel & Associates Trust Account. Thereafter, $62,720.92 was withdrawn from that trust account by Ms. Scheidel, and on 3rd June 1996 this amount was sent by telegraphic transfer in the amount of $US50,000.00 to overseas solicitors by the appellant. 
     16 Two lots of $10,000.00 were paid to Mr. Aslemoski, but no part of the principal was repaid and no part was ever returned to the trust account of Ms. Scheidel. It appears that the Commercial Trading Bank of Dubai Limited does not exist, or at least does not exist as a genuine bank. 
     17 The appellant gave evidence to the effect that the loan was negotiated on the basis that it could be invested overseas, and that he understood the money could be removed from Ms. Scheidel’s trust account for that purpose once he had an “acceptable Bank Letter of Credit”; and that he understood that this meant acceptable to Ms. Scheidel, and that the document sent by facsimile from Thailand satisfied this condition, so that the money was available to be taken from Ms. Scheidel’s trust account. The appellant also gave evidence that he understood the first version of the document which he signed, and that he signed the second version without reading it, that it was never explained to him, and that he did not know of the requirement that the money remain in the trust account.  
     18 The jury’s findings involved their being satisfied that Ms. Scheidel acted fraudulently in removing the money from the trust account, and that the appellant knew of this. It is common ground that this in turn required a finding that the appellant knew and understood the requirement added by the last amendment of the document. The essential issue in the conviction appeal is whether such a finding involved appealable error.  
     19 The first ground of appeal was that the verdict of guilty was unreasonable and could not be supported having regard to all the evidence. 
     20 Mr. Brady for the appellant submitted that the issue on the appeal concerned whether it was open to the jury to find beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant read and understood the document signed by him between about 4.15pm and 4.23pm on 31st May, or otherwise became aware of its effect. He submitted that such a finding was based entirely on circumstantial evidence, and had to be inferred from the mere fact of signing. He submitted that the jury’s finding was unreasonable in that it could not be supported by the evidence, and he referred to M v. The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487, Jones v. The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439, and R. v. Giam (NSWCCA 10/3/99). 
     21 He submitted that the evidence was that, until 4.15pm on 31st May, discussions concerning the loan were on the basis that it was for investment overseas. The first time that the requirement that the money stay in the trust account could have been conveyed to the appellant was through and subsequent to the facsimile of 4.15pm; and the amended deed was signed by the appellant and returned by facsimile by 4.23pm. There was no evidence that he was advised as to its effect; and since the document was witnessed by Mr. Wilson, and since Ms. Scheidel was involved with another client, there is a strong inference that he was not advised. A jury acting reasonably could not have rejected as a reasonable possibility that the appellant did not read or did not understand the document, and accordingly he should not have been convicted. Actual knowledge of elements of the principal offence was necessary. Mere recklessness was insufficient: Bruce v. Williams (1989) 46 A Crim R 122.  
     22 Mr. Brady submitted that this was a case of a similar character to Knight v. The Queen (1992) 175 CLR 495, in which the High Court held that the circumstances were such that an intent to kill could not be inferred beyond reasonable doubt. 
     23 Grounds 2 and 3 of the Amended Notice of Appeal were not pressed, but leave was sought to rely on a different ground, namely that the trial judge failed to give the jury any or any adequate direction in relation to the circumstantial nature of the Crown case against the appellant. 
     24 Mr. Brady submitted that, although the trial judge had said at the outset of his directions that the jury should not draw any inference unless it was the only rational inference in the circumstances, he should have given the usual circumstantial evidence direction at the time when he was explaining the Crown case to the jury, at least saying that any conclusion or inference from basic facts as to any essential element of the charge must be the only rational inference that could be drawn. 
     25 The final ground of appeal against conviction is ground 4 in the Amended Notice of Appeal, namely that the trial judge erred in that he failed to adequately direct the jury to consider corroborative evidence, and in particular the lies of the co-accused, separately in the case of each of the accused.  
     26 Mr. Brady submitted that in a joint trial a trial judge must separately direct the jury as to which evidence can be used as against which accused, and of the circumstances and the purposes for which it can be used: R v. Hauser (1982) 6 A Crim R 68 at 71. In this case, the trial judge referred to the ability of the jury, should they find that Ms. Scheidel told lies, to find those lies as “actually constituting some evidence in this case and in particular corroborating or rendering more credible the other evidence that is brought forth from documents and otherwise to suggest the dishonest intent”. Mr. Brady submitted that the trial judge failed to give a clear direction that, if the jury came to the conclusion that Ms. Scheidel had lied, that fact could not be used to corroborate the case against the appellant. Mr. Brady accepted that the trial judge had indicated, in general terms, that the jury must look at the evidence against each accused; although he pointed out that the judge did say that, if they convicted Ms. Scheidel on the evidence in relation to her case, they should look at the whole of the evidence as against the appellant. In those circumstances, there was a particular need for a clear direction that any lies told by Ms. Scheidel could not be used as supporting a finding of guilt against the appellant. 
     27 I will deal in turn with the three grounds of appeal relied on. 
     28 As regards the first ground, I do not accept a submission made by Mr. Cogswell SC for the Crown that the appellant’s signing of the changed form of agreement was direct evidence that he knew and understood its contents. In my opinion, it is rather evidence from which an inference of knowledge and understanding may be drawn. The strength of such an inference must depend upon the circumstances. The circumstances of the signing of a document may be such that the inference of knowledge and understanding of its contents can readily be drawn beyond reasonable doubt; or they may be such that such an inference could at best be drawn on the balance of probabilities, or perhaps not at all. In most cases, there would be at least a theoretical possibility that a person signing a document did not read it or did not understand it, but it must depend upon the circumstances whether this is a reasonable possibility such as would prevent knowledge and understanding being inferred beyond reasonable doubt.  
     29 The circumstances affecting the strength of the inference would include such things as the character and intelligence of the person signing it, the importance of the document to that person, the opportunity to read and digest it, the length of the document, the salience in the document of the relevant material, the clarity of the language in which it is expressed, and whether or not it is something which would be readily assimilated by reason of its being normal or expected or otherwise unsurprising. Normally, the assessment of these circumstances and thus the strength of the inference would be a matter for the jury; and very often, if no explanation is advanced by the accused which the jury considers reasonably possible, the inference of knowledge and understanding can be drawn beyond reasonable doubt.  
     30 The question seems to me to have some similarity to the position in relation to possession of recently-stolen property. Theoretically it is always possible that an accused could have come by recently-stolen property completely honestly, or at worst with no more than a suspicion that the property was stolen; and the strength of an inference that an accused knew that the property was stolen depends upon all the circumstances, these being matters which the jury can assess. Even though there may be circumstances in which possession of recently-stolen property, even if entirely unexplained, would not give rise to an inference beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew that the property was stolen, the assessment of the circumstances and the strength of the inference is generally left to the jury.  
     31 In the present case, this was a significant document, it was short, and the relevant material was not inconspicuous and was expressed reasonably clearly. It could be suggested that the relevant material would not have been readily assimilated, because of confusion from a possible internal conflict in the document (between the reference to the purpose of the loan as “investment”, and the requirement that the money stay in the solicitor’s trust account for the duration of the loan), although it should be noted that Mr. Hansen gave evidence that his understanding was that what was required was that the money be shown to be “in an account in Australia and that would assist Mr. Bujaroski, I think, with obtaining some form of credit overseas”. There was also evidence to the effect that this requirement was new and unexpected, evidence as to the hurried circumstances in which the document was signed, evidence that it was not explained to the appellant by Ms. Scheidel or Mr. Wilson, and evidence to the effect that the appellant would have expected an explanation if the alteration to the document was significant. There was no evidence positively to suggest the contrary of any of these propositions, and the suggestion that the document was signed in hurried circumstances is supported by objective evidence; but on the other hand, the jury may not have believed the appellant’s evidence as to the other matters which I have mentioned.  
     32 The question of the character and intelligence of the appellant was very much one for the jury, as was the degree of importance which the document had for the appellant and his incentive to read and understand it. Similarly, the assessment of the explanation offered by the appellant was a matter for the jury. The appellant claimed that the $65,000.00 was required for, and used in, an overseas investment in which he genuinely expected to receive $US500,000.00 within one month in return for $US50,000.00; and in my opinion it was open to the jury to disbelieve this claim and the appellant’s other explanations, to give no weight whatsoever to any of the appellant’s evidence, and to take into account their assessment of the appellant and their disbelief of his proffered explanations in deciding whether they could infer beyond reasonable doubt, from his signing of the document in the circumstances, that he knew and understood that it required that the money remain in Ms. Scheidel’s trust account. I am not satisfied that such an inference would be an unreasonable one.  
     33 For those reasons, I am not satisfied that this ground of appeal is made out.  
     34 Turning to the second ground of appeal, the one introduced by amendment, this was not in my opinion a case requiring a specific direction as to circumstantial evidence. Although I have expressed the view that the signing of the document is not direct evidence of knowledge and understanding, it would not necessarily be described as circumstantial evidence. There is authority that a circumstantial evidence direction may not need to be given where the inference to be drawn is as to the accused’s state of mind: Rogerson (1992) 65 A Crim R 530 at 545. In my opinion, the direction given about inference was sufficient in the circumstances of this case.  
     35 This point was not taken at the trial, and accordingly leave would be required if it is to be relied on on appeal. Even if I were of the view that it would have been desirable to give a circumstantial evidence direction, I do not consider that any injustice has been caused by the failure to give such a direction. 
     36 Turning to the third ground relied on in the appeal against conviction, in my opinion lies told by Ms. Scheidel were admissible against the appellant to prove that element of the charge against the appellant constituted by Ms. Scheidel’s guilt of the principal offence. It is not hearsay evidence as against the appellant: in terms of s.59 of the Evidence Act, it is not evidence of a “fact that the person intended to assert by that representation”. Accordingly, the lies, assuming the jury found them, were admissible against Ms. Scheidel not as admissions, but rather to show a mental state which itself had some relevance to the probability of her guilt. Her guilt was part of what had to be proved in the case against the appellant.  
     37 On the other hand, there was no suggestion in the summing up that Ms. Scheidel’s lack of credibility or consciousness of guilt affected the appellant’s credibility or was otherwise relevant to the appellant’s knowledge and understanding of the contents of the document. There is nothing in the directions given by the trial judge concerning lies by Ms. Scheidel which could reasonably be taken as suggesting that such lies could be used in this way against the appellant.  
     38 At the very most, it could be said that there was an omission to do something that might have been done out of an abundance of caution. In my opinion, such omission would not amount to an error. Furthermore, the point was not taken at the trial, and in my opinion, no miscarriage of justice has been caused.  
     39 Turning to the application for leave to appeal against sentence, the ground in the Amended Notice of Appeal was that the sentence was excessive and gave rise to a justifiable sense of grievance when compared to the sentence of the co-accused.  
     40 Mr. Brady in his submissions focussed particularly on the question of parity, referring to Postiglione v. The Queen (1996-7) 189 CLR 295 at 301. Mr. Brady submitted that it was inappropriate that the principal offender should receive a penalty less than the person aiding and abetting: there were no factors adverted to by the trial judge to justify the greater sentence being imposed on the appellant. 
     41 Mr. Cogswell conceded that in his submissions before the trial judge the Crown had treated Ms. Scheidel’s offence as more serious; although he submitted that there were subjective circumstances applying to her which were an important factor and must have been taken into account. He also pointed to the benefit apparently obtained by the appellant through the application of money to his purposes.  
     42 The judge may have acted on the basis that in substance the appellant was the person who instigated the offences and received the benefit of them; but that was not a matter established by the jury’s verdict or a matter which could be inferred beyond reasonable doubt by the judge. Furthermore, to act on that basis would in my opinion have been contrary to the principle in R v. De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383. 
     43 In my opinion, despite the subjective factors relevant to Ms. Scheidel, this is not a case where a greater penalty for the secondary offender than that imposed on the primary offender can be justified. The penalty imposed on the appellant should be reduced so as to be the same as that imposed on Ms. Scheidel. 
     44 I propose the following orders: 
      
      1. Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
       
      2. Leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
       
      3. Appeal against sentence allowed, sentence quashed, and in lieu thereof appellant sentenced to imprisonment for two years commencing on 3rd February 2001 and expiring on 2nd February 2003, with a non-parole period of eighteen months commencing on 3rd February 2001 and expiring on 2nd August 2002, such sentence to be served by way of periodic detention. 
       
     45 DOWD J: I have read the judgment in draft form of Hodgson JA. I agree with the proposed orders and with His Honour’s reasons. 
     46 SMART AJ: I agree with the reasons for judgment of Hodgson JA. 
     47 It was pointed out by Dawson J in Shepherd v The Queen (1989-1990) 170 CLR 573 at 578 that a circumstantial evidence direction should only be given where it is helpful and that in a case where the circumstantial evidence involved is slight such a direction may be confusing rather than helpful. Dawson J stated, ""… there is no invariable rule of practice, let alone a rule of law, that the direction should be given in every case involving circumstantial evidence"". In the present case a circumstantial evidence direction would not have been helpful. As Hodgson JA points out the critical issue at the trial was clear and simple. 
     48 I agree with Hodgson JA that the circumstances in which a document is signed are of critical importance and that the matters to which he has referred should be considered. That list is not exhaustive. Generally the signing of a document provides cogent evidence from which to infer that the signatory was aware of the effect of the document. That is so in the present case. The document was less than one page in length and reasonably clear. The applicant was well educated and experienced. It is inconceivable that he was not aware of the effect of the amendment to the earlier document, what the lender required and why he had to sign the later document. 
     49 As to sentence, this was not a case in which the criminality of the accessory was greater than that of the principal, nor one in which the subjective features of the principal offender should have led to a lesser sentence being imposed upon her than the applicant. As a solicitor, the principal offender should have been acutely conscious of the criminal course upon which she embarked.

      R v Phuong Canh NGO 
       
       
      Judgment 
       
      (On application for adjournment) 
      
    1 His Honour: On Friday 29 June last the jury found the prisoner, Phuong Canh Ngo, guilty of the murder of the late John Newman MP. Two other co-accused were found not guilty. 
    2 Following the discharge of the jury, after discussions with counsel, next Friday 12 October 2001 was fixed for hearing of submissions on sentence. Mr Nicholson SC, who appeared for Mr Ngo throughout the trial, indicated that he was retiring from his position as Senior Public Defender and would not be available. Subsequent events have shown why that was so. I proceeded on leave that day and only returned to Chambers on Monday last, the eighth instant, and my leave was the reason for the long adjournment of the sentencing proceedings. 
    3 Application has now been made to adjourn the sentencing proceedings because it appears that Mr Hoenig, who appeared as counsel for one of the accused who was acquitted, has now been briefed to appear on behalf of the prisoner, Ngo, in the sentencing proceedings, but he is not available this Friday as he had prebooked a holiday, apparently prior to accepting the brief. I am informed that some six weeks ago he approached the Senior Crown Prosecutor and told him of his predicament. The Senior Crown Prosecutor told him he would not object to an adjournment but thought the matter should be dealt with fairly soon, and that remains his attitude. 
    4 Mr Pearsall, who appeared as junior to Mr Nicholson throughout the trial, has appeared this morning to seek the adjournment. He submits that the adjournment should be granted because he anticipates that the Crown will be submitting that this is a case for the imposition of the maximum penalty of imprisonment for life; and that therefore all arguments and submissions which can be made should be made on behalf of the prisoner, and that Mr Hoenig is an experienced advocate who, because of his appearance in the trial, has a detailed knowledge of the facts. In fact he described him as ""the most experienced advocate who has knowledge of the facts"". 
    5 I accept that the Crown may be making such a submission, that it is a most serious matter, that the prisoner's position is most serious and that he should have available to him the best available counsel. The fact of the matter is that Mr Hoenig is not available. It is not as though the refusal of the adjournment will result in the prisoner being without adequate or sufficient representation. Mr Pearsall was in the trial from its beginning as junior to Mr Nicholson. He showed, by submissions he made on interlocutory matters and by his leading and cross-examination of some witnesses, that he is an extremely competent counsel, experienced in the criminal field, and I know from the Law Almanac that he has been in practice for a significant number of years and I also know that he enjoys a high reputation in the field of criminal law. It follows that Mr Ngo will have adequate, competent representation if the adjournment is refused. 
    6 I am appalled that Mr Hoenig should accept a brief for a matter which had been specially fixed when he knew at the time that he would not be available. The court lists are jammed and counsel do not have the right to juggle them or attempt to juggle them to suit their own convenience. If I considered there was a risk of injustice to the prisoner by refusing the adjournment I would grant it, but I can see no such risk. 
    7 The application for adjournment is refused. The submissions on sentence will proceed on Friday.

      REGINA v JON CHARLES HAYES 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
     1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentence imposed by Job DCJ in the Gosford District Court.2 The applicant was born in 1942 and is therefore fifty nine years of age. The offences occurred in a range of time between 1984 and 1985. He was sentenced in respect of eleven counts of a variety of sexual offences against two victims. The precise details of the offences are set out in Job DCJ’s remarks on sentence and there is no need for repetition.3 The applicant has in response to the Registrar’s direction provided some submissions in writing in relation to this appeal to which I will in due course turn. Upon receipt of written submissions on behalf of the Crown he has supplemented what he had earlier written with some further material.4 I should observe that the effect of the various sentences imposed in respect of the eleven counts is a total of a six year term with a minimum term of four years.5 The other matter which should be the subject of initial observation is that although the offences occurred many years before the applicant was dealt with, he was at the time, in respect of a large number of them, either on bail or subject to a recognizance granted to him by the late O’Brien J in respect of a separate offence of a sexual nature.6 Again, it is not necessary to detail that matter but they are aggravating circumstances, that the applicant was either on bail or upon conditional liberty when the offences were committed. 7 I turn to the matter set out in the applicant’s written submissions.8 I should say at the outset that the submissions display a lack of appreciation of the nature of the jurisdiction of this Court. The applicant has in moving terms sought that the Court be merciful. This Court is not vested with jurisdiction to impose original sentence. This is what is described as a court of error and not a court of review. It is necessary for there to be demonstrated error in the proceedings at first instance before the jurisdiction of this Court is enlivened. In short, it is not available to judges of this Court, in the event that they differed from the view expressed in a court below, simply to impose whatever sentence attracted them.9 I turn to some of the specific matters, however, which the applicant has raised. He indicated that he pleaded guilty and in so doing avoided the complainants having to undergo the trauma of giving evidence. That is undoubtedly so and in his remarks on sentence Job DCJ twice referred to that matter.10 He also referred to the circumstance that there was utilitarian value in the applicant’s plea of guilty. His Honour did not specifically quantify the amount of discount which he gave but he clearly did take it into account and although encouraged by recent authority to specify the amount of any such discount it does not manifest error to omit to do so.11 The applicant also refers to his physical condition and certain illnesses which he suffers. These again were the subject of specific acknowledgment in the Court below.12 The applicant in the supplementary material has joined issue with the Crown submission that the offences were violent in their nature. The Crown made that submission obviously in response to the applicant’s assertion that he was not or had never been a violent or physically abusive person. The applicant’s, it appears to me, understanding of the word violent is only in the sense of thuggery. The violation of young children in a sexual manner is violence indeed and there is no real cause to limit the meaning of the word in the fashion which the applicant apparently does.13 Can I turn finally to a matter which the applicant raised in these terms: 
      
       
        
        “That the sentence is within the range but on the high side of the range.” 
        
       
     14 The reason I specifically advert to that matter is that there is a misconception that the upper limit of the range of sentence is that of the statistical publications of sentence information by the Judicial Commission. Such statistics were apparently available to the applicant and indeed have been attached to Crown submissions.15 The upper limit of sentence is in fact the maximum set by parliament. If the upper limit of the statistical range is treated as reserved for the worst case or the worst offenders then persistent selection of sentences for others within that range will inevitably reduce the upper figure. This is not a matter of jurisprudence but a matter of arithmetic. I don’t regard it as appropriate to elaborate when this Court is constituted by only two judges, but the misconception is so frequently bruited about that I do not refrain from comment and I mention it in response to the express submission which the applicant has made.16 None of his submissions can be sustained and in those circumstances I would propose that the application for leave to appeal be granted but the appeal dismissed.17 HOWIE J: I agree with the reasons of the presiding judge and particularly support his comments in relation to the use of judicial statistics.18 GROVE J: The orders of the Court therefore will be as I have proposed.

       REGINA v. DAVID UAINE TAUFUA 
        
       JUDGMENT 
       
     1 GREG JAMES, J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed by the Chief Judge of the District Court in respect of offences charged in two indictments. 
     2 On the first indictment, the applicant was charged with three offences of armed robbery and one of assault with intent to rob, the maximum penalty for which offences is 20 years imprisonment. 
     3 On the second indictment the applicant was charged with three offences of shoot with intent to prevent apprehension, crimes punishable by 25 years imprisonment maximum. There was also an offence of firing a firearm in a manner likely to injure persons or property, a crime punishable by a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. There were a further two charges of offences of using an offensive weapon with intent to prevent lawful apprehension, and a charge of the offence of detaining a person for advantage (generally referred to as kidnapping), punishable, in the circumstance that injury is not caused to the victim, by a maximum of 14 years imprisonment. 
     4 In addition, his Honour was asked to take into account on a Form 1, offences of larceny, possess firearm, and take and drive conveyance without consent. 
     5 In each case the applicant pleaded guilty to the crimes charged and his Honour had regard to those pleas, as he was required to do, for the purposes of sentencing. His Honour took the offences on the Form 1 into account. 
     6 His Honour passed sentences for the offences comprised in the four counts in the first indictment of a fixed term of imprisonment for five years to commence on 7 January 2000 and to expire on 6 January 2005. On those in the second indictment comprised in counts one to three, and on the Form 1 offences, his Honour passed sentences of imprisonment for 10 years to commence on 6 January 2005 and to expire on 5 January 2015. His Honour imposed a non-parole period of five years to expire on 5 January 2010. For the offences comprised in the remaining counts on the second indictment his Honour passed sentences of imprisonment of five years fixed terms to commence on 6 January 2005 and to expire on 5 January 2010. 
     7 It becomes apparent, on an analysis of those sentences, the concurrency of the sentences, and the cumulative effect of certain of the sentences, that an overall sentence was passed commencing on 7 January 2000 of 10 years actually to be served ie., a non-parole period of that 10 years and a parole period of five years. 
     8 The application for leave to appeal against sentence asserted two grounds. They are, firstly, that his Honour erred in the way in which he cumulated sentences and, in so far as the culpability of the individual robbery offences might have been said to interact with the culpability of the other robbery offences, by dealing with the one incident as comprising several offences, passed sentences which, considered overall, exceeded that which was required, and so that any cumulation upon those sentences of the sentences passed on the second indictment produced a total sentence which exceeded that which was appropriate. 
     9 In addition, the more general ground that the sentences were manifestly excessive in totality was also taken. 
     10 The short facts of the events which gave rise to the charges and the convictions were set out by the learned Chief Judge in his remarks on sentence. Dealing with the offences of robbery, shortly, the applicant on 30 December 1999 entered the Greater Building Society in Beresfield and in one sequence of events, as the trial judge found it to be, menaced four victims seeking to obtain property from each of the four employees of the Building Society. 
     11 At about 9.30 am on that day, wearing a cap, sunglasses, a black nylon jacket, black jeans and black lace-up boots, and carrying a pistol, he entered the offices of the Building Society. There were a number of customers, including the children. He approached Ms. O'Dowd, one of the tellers, and told her to ""empty the drawer"" and she then handed him money. He then turned the pistol on Mr. Schauffler and demanded money. That teller, however, could not open the drawer. He also obtained at gunpoint money from two other tellers, Ms. Jones and Ms. Black. 
     12 The learned trial judge said in relation to that combination of offences:- 
      
       
        
        ""As I have said, it was effectively, the one transaction and I believe in so far as sentencing is concerned it is appropriate to impose one sentence which deals with all of those offences. Each sentence therefore will be concurrent and will of course take into account the general surrounding circumstances, including the fact that there were four people who were menaced by the gun."" 
        
       
     13 I do not understand that by those remarks his Honour was considering the transaction to be other than one series of events in which robbery was perpetrated but which had four victims. I do not see that the culpability of what occurred has in any way been artificially inflated by the offences having been charged in the way in which they were as separate robberies. Nor do I see that there was any double jeopardy, legal impediment or abuse involved in such charging. 
     14 The true issue on an application of this kind is as to whether the sentence, having regard to the circumstances, was excessive. 
     15 The second group of offences involved facts more complicated. On 7 January at about 12.55 p.m. a police officer spoke to the applicant. At that point he seemed to be in possession of a pistol. The trial judge found that he pointed that pistol at the constable's head at about one metre away from the constable. She crouched covering her head. Another officer called on the applicant to drop his gun. At that stage his Honour said:- 
      
       
        
        ""Neither of them had their firearms drawn."" 
        
       
     16 I take that to be a reference to the two police officers. His Honour refers to a further Constable being present at that time. His Honour found that the applicant moved the aim of his pistol in the direction of these two latter constables and then back to the first constable. That menacing with the pistol was the subject matter of certain of the charges. 
     17 The applicant walked away still holding his pistol, followed by the police officers. He went into the Stardust Hotel. Other police were called. Later he left the hotel and walked to an alleyway. Another police officer entered the alleyway from the direction in which the applicant was walking. He saw the applicant walking towards him still with the pistol. The constable had his gun drawn and asked the applicant to stop, but the applicant aimed his gun at the constable from about fifteen metres, causing the constable to take cover. The applicant then went to the side entrance of a nearby building where he approached a civilian victim, putting the pistol to that man's head. He forced the man to get into a truck, placing the pistol against the man's head whilst he held the man in a headlock. He pushed the victim into the driver's seat and climbed over to the passenger's seat. Holding the gun on the victim he told him to drive the truck away.  
     18 The truck was followed by numerous police vehicles. During the journey the applicant leant out of the passenger's side window pointing the pistol directly at two police officers that were in a pursuing police vehicle and pulled the slide mechanism of the pistol to the rear and released it, thereby enabling it to be fired. 
     19 When the truck was stopped in traffic he leant out of the vehicle and discharged one round in the direction of those police vehicles but that round did not strike anybody. 
     20 The truck then crossed to the incorrect side of the road, moved around traffic and was driven past the Cabramatta Police Station. At a point in St. Johns Road the applicant pointed the pistol out of the truck and fired another round into an adjacent block of flats. This was in an area where there were a number of pedestrians on the footpath, but no one was injured by the discharge of the gun. 
     21 The journey continued until a point at the intersection of the Cumberland Highway with John Street. The applicant sat on a window ledge of the truck and fired two or three shots towards Constables Rudd and Murphy who were still following behind. None of these shots found their mark and eventually the truck stopped in Old Cabramatta Road East. The applicant got out of the truck with the civilian victim. 
     22 The police vehicle stopped a short distance away but the pistol held by the applicant was pointed at them. Constable Murphy fired one shot at the applicant, which struck the passenger door of the truck. The officer's pistol then jammed. By the time he had cleared the jam the applicant had removed the victim from the truck and was holding him as a hostage in a hostile position with the pistol pointed at his neck. 
     23 The applicant then walked across the road and entered a nearby pharmacy. Staff and customers of the pharmacy fled. A siege situation developed in the pharmacy. About five minutes after entering the shop the applicant discharged a further shot from the pistol which struck a brick wall on the other side of the road from the pharmacy, near to where police were positioned. The siege continued for two and a half to three hours during which time the applicant held the pistol to the head of the victim and told the victim to search for syringes. During the course of the siege, some money was removed and a syringe was found and the applicant got the victim to help him remove a white substance from his wallet and assist him in mixing the substance which the applicant then put in the syringe and injected himself. 
     24 Subsequently the victim was released in return for cigarettes. 
     25 Police hostage negotiators reminded the applicant he was a father and had responsibilities. He then left the chemist shop and lay on the ground where he was arrested and his pistol, a nine millimetre self-loading pistol, was recovered. There was one round in the magazine and one round in the chamber. 
     26 In addition to these matters which were found by the learned Chief Judge, there was evidence that during this time the applicant was withdrawing from a heroin addiction and was suicidal.  
     27 His Honour found the offences involved in these events to be extremely serious. He referred to the applicant's prior subjective circumstances. At the time of sentence the applicant was 27 years of age, having been born in 1973. He had come to Australian when he was six from New Zealand and has a criminal history which began when he was only 15 years old. 
     28 His Honour referred to the circumstances of that criminal history, and the offences which resulted in the applicant having spent a significant time in institutions as a young person. He had been in gaol as an adult, indeed for a substantial period of time in consequence of his having been charged and convicted of a robbery offence, which conviction was overturned causing a new trial. A second conviction was also overturned on appeal. A third trial occurred where the jury disagreed. He was eventually no-billed. He was in due course able to receive bail and was on bail at the time at which these offences were committed. He had been released from custody only two weeks prior to the Beresfield robberies.  
     29 Since he had not been in custody on a continuous basis, and since, to diminish these sentences for the time the applicant was in custody referrable to that earlier charge would not have been in accord with authority, the learned trial judge did allow a reduction for the period of some 27 months the applicant had spent in gaol. He, however, referred to that matter in circumstances which make it clear that he had regard to the fact the applicant had been in custody for that period when fixing the sentences overall. He also had regard to the reports dealing with the applicant's life and background, including a report from a psychologist, a report from Dr Olav Neilssen, psychiatrist, and a report from the Community Welfare worker, the Pacific Island Welfare Project. There was also tendered to the court a letter from his sister referring to the family difficulties, which were set out in some detail in the histories, those reports to which I have referred. 
     30 His Honour referred particularly to the fact that the violence associated with these offences meant that the applicant would be detained in significant segregation within the prison system, which segregation his Honour found was, and I have no doubt still is, having a profound effect upon him. His Honour concluded that the applicant also showed signs of institutionalisation which process would advance with the years the applicant would have to spend in gaol. His Honour referred to the applicant's intellectual function being at a low level; that he was going to have extremely difficulty readapting to the community. His Honour accepted at the conclusion of the sentence he would be institutionalised and would not have any of the strengths to deal with that and overcome it. 
     31 His Honour specifically found matters going to mitigate the sentence as were relevant to the submissions that were made by counsel on his behalf to us concerning the limited requirements for general deterrence arising from the applicant's heroin addiction and withdrawal, and his mental problems. I see no error in that. I note that his Honour specifically found matters which go to the circumstances of the applicant's upbringing in conditions of disadvantage, including poverty, and his Honour took them into account. It was submitted that his family background and circumstances go to support the application of those principles referred to in the decision in R v. Fernando (1992) 76 A. Crim. R. 58 and that his Honour erred in not applying those principles. However, in my view, his Honour did properly have regard to the factual conditions in this case as he would have had he expressly applied Fernando (supra). 
     32 His Honour further found that the applicant, when committing, particularly, the offences charged in the second indictment, appeared to have been, according to the evidence, calm and deliberate in his actions. His Honour held that it was an appalling criminal episode which had to be understood in the light of all the underlying circumstances. In that regard, his Honour referred to the prior history, the psychiatric problems, and the heroin addiction. 
     33 It was with these matters in mind that his Honour structured the sentences in the way in which he did, ie., to look globally at the first episode and impose a sentence which is concurrent on each of the offences charged in the first indictment. 
     34 I do not consider his Honour was in error in any way in taking that course. Indeed, when one looks at the totality of the sentence on the first indictment, it may be that such an approach was lenient. His Honour concluded that the second episode, which was much more serious, could be approached in the same way, i.e. to impose a sentence concurrent for the first charge in the second indictment which globally reflected the criminality involved. Again, I find no error in that approach. His Honour concluded in discretion that that sentence would be cumulative upon the sentence first imposed. I see no error in that approach. 
     35 It is submitted that each of the sentences exceed that which was appropriate for the series of crimes encompassed by each group of sentences. I do not agree. Indeed, when one comes to examine the very serious criminality involved in the second series of offences, those embraced by the second indictment, his Honour's sentence could again be considered as lenient. I see no error in the cumulation of the two groups of sentences. 
     36 His Honour concluded there was an appropriate basis for disturbing the statutory ratio for a non-parole period. In particular, his Honour had regard to the fact that the sentence would inevitably produce a significant destruction of the applicant as a human being because of the long period in gaol. I can only share with his Honour the compassion his Honour evinced for the individual that he was so sentencing and his recognition of that fact. But his Honour was bound to sentence according to law. 
     37 This is a court of error. This court may only interfere if his Honour has fallen into legal error. Accepting that what his Honour was dealing with here was an exercise of gross criminality as a result of the effects, appalling effects, on this applicant of drugs, nonetheless I am unable to detect legal error in what his Honour did such as to warrant this court intervening. 
     38 I share his Honour's view that it is to be hoped that within the custodial situation the applicant should be treated in a way which will assist in his eventual rehabilitation, and hope that the family life and care which his Honour referred to will remain to assist him to achieve that. But I cannot conclude that his Honour has fallen into error in imposing the sentence that he did. 
     39 In the extensive written submissions that were provided that question of an inflation of culpability leading to a higher sentence to which I have referred was raised. I reiterate that I reject that submission. 
     40 In addition, there was raised the question of cumulation. I reiterate that I would reject that submission. 
     41 There was also raised by comparison with various cases, of differing circumstances, some of which were in differing jurisdictions, and by reference to the sentencing statistics prepared by the Judicial Commission, provided to us in submissions this morning, the submission that the overall sentence and the component sentences were manifestly excessive having regard to the criminality involved. None of these cases are other than specific illustrations on other occasions of other facts with other results. I am unable to accept that as showing any foundation for the general proposition that this sentence or its components is so far in excess of that which should have been passed as to show error in the exercise of discretion. 
     42 I have therefore come to the conclusion that the application for leave should be granted - as the matter has been the subject of extensive written submissions and to a lesser extent the submissions of counsel, who kindly offered to assist on a pro bono basis the court and the applicant but the appeal should be dismissed. 
     43 STEIN, JA: I agree with the reasons and proposed orders of Greg James, J. and will merely add some short remarks of my own. 
     44 First, I want to record that the applicant has appeared for himself with the aid of detailed written submissions that were prepared on his behalf, both in chief and in reply to the Crown's submissions. However, this morning Mr. Hamill of counsel, in the best spirit of the bar, volunteered to be an amicus for the court and to assist the applicant, which he did with his consent. That resulted in Mr. Hamill proffering some advice to the applicant and making some submissions in relation to the application before the court. This was supplemented by some further oral submissions made by the applicant himself. 
     45 Bearing in mind the factual circumstances of the offences, as related by Greg James, J., and to be found in the judgment of the Chief Judge of the District Court, the conclusion must be that they were extraordinarily serious in their nature, especially in relation to the second indictment. It is plain that it cannot be concluded that the sentences imposed by his Honour are excessive in their totality, let alone manifestly excessive. Nor am I able to conclude that the accumulation of the sentences by his Honour involved any error. Indeed, in one way his Honour's sentences may be seen as being on the lenient side. There is no circumstance that I can see that can constitute double jeopardy or an abuse of process.  
     46 Greg James, J. has referred to the tragedy of the situation of the applicant because of his severe drug addiction, and I would agree with his Honour's remarks. The only word that I would add is that it was very fortunate the tragedy was not worse than it was and that none of the bullets found their mark. 
     47 I agree with Greg James, J. that the application for leave appeal to appeal should be granted but the appeal dismissed. 
     48 STUDDERT, J: I agree with the orders proposed by Greg James, J. I also agree with all that has been said by the other members of the court. I would only wish to express my own appreciation for the assistance offered by Mr. Hamill of counsel to the applicant, and indeed to this court, assistance offered in the best spirit of the bar. 
     49 STEIN, JA: The orders of the court are accordingly that the application for leave to appeal against sentence is granted and the appeal is dismissed.

       Regina v Graham Francis FISHER 
        
       
       
      The appellant was convicted of assault with intent to rob. The main question in the case was one of identification. Witnesses claimed they saw the same person who had committed the crime with a woman later that day. An identification parade was held three days after the incident, and two witnesses of the crime identified the appellant. The appellant objected to the admission of this evidence at trial on the ground that its probative value was outweighed by the prejudice to the defendant (s137  
      Evidence Act 
       1995). The basis of the objection was that the appellant was the only person in the line-up of six persons to match the description given by witnesses of a man of aboriginal appearance with shoulder length hair. The trial Judge admitted the evidence, and the appellant challenged this decision. An additional challenge was made on the basis that the trial Judge did not direct the jury to consider the identification evidence separately from evidence connecting the appellant with the woman. 
       
       
      Held: 
       (per Sheller JA, Sully J and Hulme J agreeing): 
       
      1. The jury was entitled to take account of the evidence of the appellant’s association with the woman together with the identification evidence, if this was otherwise admissible. 
       
      2. None of the men in the line-up parade had an appearance similar to the appellant. Namely, none of them were of aboriginal appearance with shoulder length hair. 
       
      3. The inherent tendency of a witness at the identification parade to select the appellant as the only person answering this description had the effect of lessening the probative value of this evidence and of increasing the danger of unfair prejudice. This evidence should have been excluded pursuant to s137. 
       
      4. The admission of the identification evidence resulted in a substantial miscarriage of justice.

       Regina v Graham Francis FISHER 
        
        
       Judgment 
       
     1 Sheller JA:  
      
       
      Introduction 
       
      The appellant was arraigned on an indictment containing one count of assault with intent to rob and an alternative count of attempt to steal from the person. The offence was alleged to have been committed on 21 March 1999 at Orange. The alleged victim was Fiona Wymer (Mrs Wymer). The appellant pleaded not guilty and was tried before his Honour Judge Nield and a jury of twelve. The trial began on 23 January 2001 but was aborted on 25 January. The trial began again on 29 January. On 30 January the jury returned with a verdict of guilty on the count of assault with intent to rob. On 9 February 2001 the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for two years with a non-parole period of nine months, the non-parole period to be served by way of periodic detention.  
       
     2 On this appeal there was no issue that on 21 March 1999 at 2.15 pm, shortly after Mrs Wymer had withdrawn $220 from a National Australia Bank automatic teller machine, a man grabbed her arm from behind in an attempt to take the money. The assailant was unsuccessful and ran off down the street. Mrs Wymer’s daughter, Jeanne (the victim’s daughter), was with her at the time. She said that she saw the offender’s face for a few seconds. The appellant participated in an identification parade and was identified by the victim’s daughter. Mrs Wymer was unable to make any identification. The incident was also witnessed by four men in a car. One of them, Darren Pritchard, picked the appellant out in the identification parade. Three of the four men, Darren Pritchard, Bradley Murray and Clinton Pritchard, said they had seen the offender walking with a woman not far from where the offence took place a short time before the offence. 
     3 Darren and Clinton Pritchard recognised the woman as Ricky Frail, having been to school with her. Both these witnesses were aware that Ricky Frail had a sister, Jamilla. Both said they were sure they saw Ricky and not Jamilla. Both said they could tell the sisters apart on the basis of one being a bigger build than the other. Darren Pritchard said that Jamilla was a smaller build than Ricky. Clinton Pritchard said that Jamilla was thicker set. 
      
       
      Record of Interview 
       
     4 Senior Constable Darcy gave evidence that he had conducted a record of interview with the appellant on 21 March 1999. The record of interview was admitted into evidence. In it the appellant stated that he was, and had, for a number of months been in a relationship with Ricky Frail. He said he had gone down town with her that day, but that he had lost her and she went with her sister. He said he was wearing a blue shirt and blue jeans. He had changed these after getting home, about half an hour before the police came. He denied any knowledge of the offence and agreed to participate in the identification parade.  
      
       
      Identification Parade 
       
     5 The identification parade took place on 24 March 1999, three days after the offence. In addition to the appellant, there were five other persons. These were the same five persons for each witness who took part. The identification of the appellant by the victim’s daughter and Darren Pritchard was admitted over objection and after evidence had been taken during the aborted trial on the voir dire. The objection was taken in reliance upon s137 of the Evidence Act 1995 which provides: 
      
       
       “In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.” 
       
       
      The prejudice to which this section refers is not that the evidence merely tends to establish the Crown case; it means prejudice which is unfair because there is a real risk that the evidence will be misused by the jury in some unfair way; see  
      R v BD 
       (1997) 94 A CrimR 131 at 139 quoted with approval by McHugh J in  
      Papakosmas v The Queen 
       (1999) 196 CLR 297 para 91. 
       
     6 The basis of the objection was that the appellant was the only person in the line-up of six persons who matched the description of the offender as of aboriginal appearance with shoulder length hair.  
     7 When she was at the police station on 21 March 1999 the victim’s daughter did not give police a description of the assailant. On 9 April 1999 the victim’s daughter attended at the Orange Police Station and gave a statement in which, according to Judge Nield in his reasons for judgment on the admissibility of the identification evidence, she described Mrs Wymer’s assailant as: 
      
       
       “1. Adult; because she used the word man and not juvenile, 
        
       2. Male; because she used the word man, 
        
       3. Of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Island descent, 
        
       4. With dark skin (see Exhibit F).” 
       
      The victim’s daughter did not refer to the assailant’s hair.  
       
     8 On the voir dire she was called first. She acknowledged the truth and correctness of a statement she had made on 9 April 1999. Asked about the identification parade, she answered as follows: 
      
       
       “A. What was there about the man that you picked that told you that it was the man who had assaulted your mother? A. Well his face was familiar but he also had long hair but I don’t want to make a judgment just on the fact he had long hair alone so I asked the other men in the witness – in the parade whether or not they’d had a haircut and one said he had on Friday but that was before the assault, so I decided it was 7 then. 
        
       Q. So you relied upon his face being familiar and his hair being long? A. Yes and familiar to the …(not transcribable).. 
        
       Q. You said in your statement that he was of aboriginal and Torres Strait Island descent? A. Yes. 
        
       Q. And all the men, the 6 of them, were dark skinned? A. I think so, I can’t remember that far but I think they were. 
        
       Q. Did you rely upon his skin colouring? A. Well if they were all Torres Strait Islander descent then the skin colouring wouldn’t have mattered that much but it was part of his face, so.” 
       
     9 The victim’s daughter agreed that when she was at the police station on the afternoon of the robbery she was shown a video and a book of photographs. She said that neither she nor her mother could indicate from the video or the photographs in the book the person whom she saw committing the robbery.  
     10 The victim’s daughter gave the following evidence in cross-examination: 
      
       
       “ 
       Q. So the long hair – when you were in the line up situation, the long hair that was something that was uppermost in your mind because your recollection of the person who committed this alleged offence on the Sunday afternoon outside the ATM was a person with long hair, is that right? A. Yes. 
        
       Q. So when you went in to the identification parade you were looking for someone with long hair, is that right? A. I was looking for the person I saw – like his face as well as the hair, it wasn’t just the hair. 
        
       Q. But I take it that the long hair was an important consideration in your mind, is that right? A. Yes. 
        
       Q. You told the police in your statement that you made on 9 April 1999 that the person was a man of aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent with dark skin, is that right? A. Yes. 
        
       Q. Of all the people who were lined up the person you chose, the number 7, his skin was the lightest wasn’t it? A. Still darker than mine. 
        
       Q. Darker than yours? A. Yep, that’s darker to me. 
        
       Q. But he wasn’t of dark skin was he, the person you chose? A.  
       Compared to the others he wasn’t as dark. 
        
       Q. But he had long hair? A. Yeah but – his face as well as the hair. 
        
       Q. On the day of the robbery, that was 21 March 1999, did you observe this person who allegedly committed the robbery, did commit the robbery, did you observe that person for long. How long would you have been able to observe that person? A. One, two seconds when he looked at me. 
        
       Q. About two seconds when he looked at you? A. Yes. 
        
       Q. Were you standing next to your mother at that time? A. Yes, I might have been a bit in front of her. 
        
       Q. You were walking were you? A. Yes. 
        
       Q. Up towards Anson Street, is that right? A. Away from Anson Street. 
        
       Q. Away from Anson Street, sorry, away from Anson Street. Did you say you were ahead of your mother or behind your mother a little bit? A. Ahead. 
        
       Q. So when you mother was attacked you didn’t see the actual attack? A. No but I saw her yelling out. 
        
       Q. That attracted your attention? A. Yes, and I looked around and there was a man – my mum – had grabbed her from behind with his arms around her and she’d doubled over so – like ‘Oh my God what’s this’ and then like – I said like ‘hey’ or ‘oye’ or called out or something and started moving towards them to try and help and he looked at me and then he ran away. 
        
       Q. When you turned around – when your mother yelled out you turned around? A. Yes. 
        
       Q. Was the man’s back facing you or his side or his front? A. He was probably facing me but he had his head down. 
        
       Q. So you couldn’t see his face at that stage? A. No, not at that instant no. 
        
       Q. At some stage you saw his face for about two seconds? A. Yes he looked at me. 
        
       Q. He looked at you? A. Yes.” 
       
     11 Darren Pritchard was the next witness on the voir dire. He acknowledged as truthful two statements made, one on 22 March 1999 and the other on 7 April 1999. He gave the following evidence: 
      
       
       “Q. On 24 March 1999 when you were taken into a room and shown an array of persons, in your mind – you had given – stated to the police where you’d stated that the person you had saw was of aboriginal appearance. In your opinion were all people in that parade of aboriginal appearance? A. No there was a couple who were of like Fijian appearance. 
        
       HIS HONOUR: Q. Of? A. Fijian. 
        
       CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. Because of that they were excluded from your mind for consideration? A. Yep, yes. 
        
       Q. Were there people of varying height, do you recall that? A. Yes there was a few short ones and then they varied in height. 
        
       Q. Did you notice anything about the length of their hair? A, Well there were only a couple with long, like shoulder length hair which one of them was Fijian and the other was the one which I picked. 
        
       Q. So other than the one you picked there was one who looked Fijian with longer hair? A. Yes. 
        
       Q. In relation to the number 7 that you chose, what was passing through your mind in terms of selection that person? A. Well he just stood out and like his shoulder length hair was – it matched and just his face. 
        
       HIS HONOUR: Q. So his face matched and his shoulder length hair matched? A. Yes. 
        
       Q. Anything else match? A. Well I don’t-- 
        
       Q. Well height or body shape or skin colour or clothing -- A. Skin colour as well. 
        
       Q. What about his age? A. Well he looked to be about the same age as what I thought he was when I saw him the first time. 
        
       CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. I want to ask you about the way that people were standing in the line up, whether they were leaning over or anything, was there anything about the way that anyone was standing? A. He was standing like different from the rest, the others were just like straight up like nothing was wrong or anything and he was sort of slouched a bit.” 
       
     12 He could not be positive if the police had shown him a book of photographs or not but he did not think he had seen a video showing faces of men. He was then questioned as follows: 
      
       
       “Q. You say that when you went in there you selected the person because of his shoulder length hair, is that right? A. Yep. 
        
       Q. And his face matched, is that right? A. Mm’mm. 
        
       HIS HONOUR. Q. And his age and his stance? A. Yes. 
        
       WALSH: Q. You say that his stance was different from the other people, is that right? A. Yep. 
        
       Q. But they were kind of in a relaxed sort of stance? A. Yep. 
        
       Q. And he wasn’t, this number 7 wasn’t, is that right? A. Mm’mm. 
        
       Q. So he stood out to you? A. Yep. 
        
       ….. 
        
       Q. No doubt in the line up, the fact he had the long hair was one of the features that attracted you to looking at number 7, is that right? A. Mm’mm. 
        
       Q. That correct? A. Yep. 
        
       Q. Do you recall if the others had long hair? A. There was probably just – there was the one other who was of Fijian appearance. 
        
       Q. So you scouted him, put him out of your mind? A. Mm’mm. 
        
       Q. And you were attracted to the other person with the long hair, is that right? (no verbal reply) 
        
       Q. So is the situation that when you participated in this line up, given the appearance of the people before you, the 6 people before you and bearing in mind the description you’d given to the police, that really there was only one person who stood out and answered that description, that right? A. Yep, yes. 
        
       Q. And that was number 7 that you picked? A. Yes. 
        
       Q. Because the other didn’t fit the description given to the police? A. No.” 
       
     13 In his reasons for judgment, Judge Nield said: 
      
       
       ”On 22 March 1999 Mrs Wymer, Mr Pritchard and Mr Murray attended at Orange Police Station, and each, independently of the other, made a statement to police. Mrs Wymer described her assailant as: 
       
       
       1. Adult, 
        
       2. Male, 
        
       3. Of Aboriginal Appearance, 
        
       4. Of solid build, 
        
       5. With dark skin, 
        
       6. With black shoulder length hair, 
        
       7. About 5’10” tall, 
        
       8. Wearing a red terry towelling hat, light coloured tee-shirt worn outside his trousers, and lose fitting long trousers (see Exhibit M1). 
       
       
       Mr Darren Pritchard described the man involved in the incident with Mrs Wymer as the man who he had seen earlier with Ricky Frail as: 
       
       
       1. Adult, about 30 years old, 
        
       2. Male, 
        
       3. Of Aboriginal appearance, 
        
       4. With dark coloured shoulder length hair, 
        
       5. With facial hair as though he had not shaved for a few days, 
        
       6. Wearing a red coloured baseball cap, light coloured T-shirt and dark coloured long pants (See Exhibit G1). 
       
       
       Mr Bradley Murray, who had been with Mr Pritchard, described the man who ‘nudged’, and that is the word he used in his statement, Mrs Wymer as the man who he had seen earlier with an indigenous woman as: 
       
       
       1. Adult in his 30’s, 
        
       2. Male, 
        
       3. Black, that is of Aboriginal descent, 
        
       4. Of big build, 
        
       5. Unshaven, 
        
       6. Wearing a red hat and long sleeved white shirt (see Exhibit L).” 
       
     14 A little further on, his Honour noted from the video recording of the identification parade that as at 24 March 1999 the accused was: 
      
       
       “1. An adult; I know from the transcript of the interview Exhibit K that his date of birth is 31 December 1967, so that he was aged 31 years, 2 months and some days. 
        
       2. Male, 
        
       3. Of Aboriginal descent, 
        
       4. With dark skin, although not as dark as some of the other five males in the identification parade, 
        
       5. Of solid build, 
        
       6. With dark shoulder length hair, 
        
       7. With facial hair as though he had not shaved for a few days. 
        
       8. I know from Exhibit K that he is the de facto husband of Ricky Frail.” 
       
     15 After referring to counsel’s submission based on s137 of the Evidence Act, Judge Nield said: 
      
       
       “Secondly, as to the question raised by the submission that the accused was the only person in the identification parade with shoulder length hair, the requirement of s137 of the Evidence Act is clear. If the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused, then I must refuse to admit the evidence. Thus I do not have any discretion. I must weigh the value of the evidence against the danger of unfair prejudice. I see the evidence of the identification parade as highly probative. Neither witness relied solely upon the length of the accused’s hair, and both witnesses identified the accused who was, in fact, the de facto husband of Ricky Frail. I do not see the method of obtaining the evidence as being unfairly prejudicial to the accused, 
         
       although I acknowledge that the selection of the accused in a parade of men all having shoulder length hair would have been better. I reject the accused’s counsel’s submission that the identification parade was in effect a parade of one man. That this was not the case is confirmed by the fact that Mrs Wymer did not identify the accused as her assailant. 
       
       
       The identification parade and the selection of the accused as the complainant’s assailant are but pieces of a large amount of identification evidence. I do not see them as being unfairly prejudicial to the accused. I decline to prohibit the Crown Prosecutor from adducing the evidence of 
         
       identification parade, and the identification of the accused by two of the witnesses as the complainant’s assailant.” 
       
       
      Appeal 
       
     16 The appellant relied on four grounds of appeal: 
      
       
       1. The learned trial Judge erred in admitting into evidence the identification evidence of the victim’s daughter. 
       
       
       2. The learned trial Judge erred in admitting into evidence the identification evidence of Darren Pritchard. 
       
       
       3. The learned trial Judge’s directions in relation to identification were inadequate. 
       
       
       4. The learned trial Judge erred in failing to warn the jury that the evidence of the identification of the appellant as the offender must be considered separately from the evidence that the offender had been earlier seen with a person named Ricky Frail. 
       
       
      Grounds 1 and 2 
       
     17 An identification parade, if properly carried out, provides the most reliable method of identification; see Alexander v The Queen (1981) 145 CLR 395 at 400. However, that reliability depends, in part, on ensuring that as far as possible those who parade are of the same age, height and general appearance as the suspect; compare Code D issued pursuant to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (UK), Archbold Pleading Evidence and Practice 2001 particularly at 1335 para 14/51. 
     18 This Court viewed the video of the identification parade. The appellant was a man of aboriginal appearance with long hair. The only other person with long hair had it tied in a pony tail behind his head. The other four participants had short hair. They like the appellant, and the other man with the pony tail, were dark skinned. None of them had an appearance similar to the appellant.  
     19 The learned trial Judge referred to the attendance of Darren Pritchard at the Orange Police Station on 22 March 2000. Darren Pritchard described the man in the incident, inter alia, as being of aboriginal appearance with dark coloured shoulder length hair. When giving evidence on the voir dire he put aside the other person with long hair because he “looked Fijian” and agreed that in the line up the fact that the appellant had the long hair “was one of the features that attracted” him to look at him.  
     20 In short, so far as this witness was concerned, there was no one else in the line up who answered the two significant parts of his identification, namely aboriginal appearance and shoulder length dark hair. 
     21 Probative value is defined in Pt 1 of the Dictionary to the Evidence Act as the extent to which the evidence could rationally effect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue. In my opinion, the probative value of Darren Pritchard’s identification of the appellant during the identification parade was low and outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant. Both sides of the scale were infected by the inherent tendency at the identification parade for Darren Pritchard to select the only person who answered two important elements in the description he had given. In my opinion, pursuant to s137 this evidence should not have been admitted. 
     22 The evidence of identification at the identification parade given by the victim’s daughter differed in that as the trial Judge observed she had not given the police a description of the assailant when she was at the police station on 21 March 1999. However, in giving evidence on the voir dire when asked what there was about the man she had picked that told her that it was the man who had assaulted her mother she answered:  
      
       
        “Well his face was familiar but he also had long hair but I don’t want to make a judgment just on the fact he had long hair alone so I asked the other men in the witness – in the parade whether or not they’d had a hair cut and one said he had on Friday. But that was before the assault, so I decided it was 7 then.” 
       
     23 Undoubtedly a feature of the identification was the assailant’s long hair. She had also said he was of aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent. She agreed that in the line up situation the long hair was something that was uppermost in her mind because he recollection of the person who committed the offence was a person with long hair. It was not just the hair but the long hair that was an important consideration in her mind. 
     24 Again, for reasons that I have given concerning the evidence of Darren Pritchard, I think the evidence of identification at the identification parade by the victim’s daughter was of low probative value outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant. In my opinion, pursuant to s137 this evidence should have been rejected. 
      
       
      Ground 3 
       
     25 During the course of summing up on the identification evidence the learned trial Judge said: 
      
       
       “So, members of the jury, it may well be when you consider the evidentiary material that the identification parade is of little value to you. However, bear in mind that the people who identified the accused in the identification parade, Miss Wymer and Mr Darren Pritchard, said that it was not only the length of the hair which was the feature relied upon in the identification. Members of the jury, the fact is that both of them chose a person in the identification parade who had an association with Miss Ricky Frail and that is one of the criteria relied upon by the Crown as identifying the accused as the man who was involved in the incident with Mrs Wymer.” 
       
     26 This passage is significant in that it acknowledges that it was open to the jury to conclude that the identification parade evidence was of little value. However, contrary to the submissions made on behalf of the appellant, I do not think that separately it had the effect of undermining appropriate warnings earlier given by the trial Judge in relation to the identification. Nor do I think it involved any circularity in using the evidence that the offender was with Ricky Frail to bolster the identification. Had the identification parade been admissible it seems to me entirely appropriate that the trial Judge summed up in a way which brought to the jury’s attention various matters which the jury might have thought identified the appellant as the assailant. The point was not taken as a basis for further direction. No complaint was made about this part of the summing up. In my opinion, leave to argue it should be refused under Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules.  
      
       
      Ground 4 
       
     27 It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that not only should the direction criticised in ground 3 not have been given but that a contrary direction should have been given. The trial Judge erred in not directing the jury that the identification evidence had to be considered separately from the evidence connecting the offender with Ricky Frail. This was said to be so because the two strands did not rise independently. As I understand it the suggestion was that the appellant was only in the identification parade because of his association with Ricky Frail. For reasons already given I do not think this ground has any substance at all. The jury was perfectly entitled to take account of the identification evidence, if otherwise admissible, together with the appellant’s association with Ricky Frail in determining whether or not the appellant was the assailant. Again no re-direction of the sort suggested was asked for at the trial. Leave should be refused under Rule 4. 
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
     28 In my opinion, the admission of the identification evidence of the victim’s daughter and Darren Pritchard resulted in a substantial miscarriage of justice. Accordingly, I propose the following orders: 
      
       
       1. Appeal allowed; 
        
       2. Quash the conviction; 
        
       3. Order a new trial 
       . 
       
     29 SULLY J: I agree with Sheller JA. 
     30 HULME J: I agree with the orders proposed by Sheller JA and with his Honour’s reasons.

     REGINA v Stephen Edward SAARI 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1    HIS HONOUR: On 10 April 2001 Stephen Edward Saari pleaded guilty to the murder of one Daniel Ryan on 6 June 2000 at Rathmines in the State of New South Wales. 
    2    The facts are uncomplicated and largely uncontroversial. The offender, who is now forty-two years of age, commenced a relationship with one Ms Loretta Conlon during the winter of 1998. After some months, the offender moved into Ms Conlon’s home where also lived her son, James. The offender had come to know, through a family connection, a Mr Gregory Hudson, whose house was close to that of Ms Conlon. Mr Hudson’s premises included a self-contained shed in the back yard where it was usual for him to meet with his friends on social occasions. One of those friends was the deceased, Daniel Ryan, whom the offender got to know. Some time before June 2000 a handbag and some jewellery was stolen from Ms Conlon’s house. For reasons which are not altogether clear but at all events which seem entirely inadequate, the offender told a number of people that he believed that it was Daniel Ryan who had taken this property. Indeed, on several occasions the offender confronted Mr Ryan about the theft and Mr Ryan denied that he was responsible.  
    3    On the evening of 3 June 2000 the offender and Mr Ryan, together with a number of others, were socialising in Mr Hudson’s shed. The offender was well affected by alcohol and confronted Mr Ryan about the theft once again. Again, the accusation was denied. Later that evening, the offender and Mr Ryan went to Ms Conlon’s house. A short time later what sounded like a gunshot was heard to come from the direction of the house by people in the shed. A few minutes later Mr Ryan returned to the shed and said that the offender had pointed a shotgun at him and then fired it into a brick wall inside the garage. Police subsequently found a mattress, obviously damaged by a shotgun blast, which had passed through it and into the garage wall at Ms Conlon’s premises. On the following day, there was again a gathering of people at Mr Hudson’s shed. That gathering included the offender and Mr Ryan. The offender was again affected by alcohol. Later that night the offender, in a drunken rage, assaulted Ms Conlon’s son, James, and had an argument with Ms Conlon. The police were called but the offender left the house before the police arrived and spent the night in Mr Hudson’s shed. On the following day, 5 June 2000, the offender spent the day at the shed drinking alcohol, leaving on one occasion to seek reconciliation with Ms Conlon. However, Ms Conlon told him that their relationship was over and he had to leave her house. He made arrangements to secure some of his possessions, including a 357-magnum calibre Smith & Wesson six shot revolver, which he had given to James Conlon sometime earlier and who had secreted it away from the house.  
    4    On 6 June 2000, on the evening of which the murder was committed, the offender was in the shed. He was drinking alcohol but the extent to which he was affected is unclear. In the early afternoon, he returned to Ms Conlan’s house to pick up his possessions, which included the revolver, which had been returned to the house. When the offender arrived back at the shed he was carrying two bags, which contained, amongst other things, the revolver and ammunition. These bags were put onto a bed at the rear of the shed area. The offender continued to drink. During the evening of that day a number of people arrived at the shed. A makeshift wood-burning heater was in use and some sausages were cooked. Six males were present including the deceased and the offender. As the evening progressed, the offender’s behaviour was observed to change. His manner became short with people for no apparent reason although no particular point was made of this, since he commonly became surly when affected by alcohol. The offender wandered around inside the shed and sat on the bed, placing his head in his hands. Sometime after 9 o’clock, the offender got up from the bed and approached the others, saying to no-one in particular, “I suppose youse are going to turn on me, are you?” Mr Hudson replied, “I don’t know what you’re talking about”. The offender walked back to the bed area and sat down. Shortly after, he got up off the bed and walked back towards the group. He was holding a revolver in his right hand, down by his side. He walked up to Mr Ryan, pointed the gun directly at his head and said, “I’m going to shoot this fucking cunt”. Mr Ryan turned in the swivel chair to face the offender. What happened next is not clear, but it appeared to one of the witnesses that, without giving Mr Ryan a chance to answer, the offender lowered the gun somewhat, and, after a little hesitation, discharged it. It appears that Mr Ryan was turning away from him. The bullet entered his side at the bottom of the rib cage. The offender then raised the revolver towards Mr Ryan’s head. Mr Ryan got up, pushed the revolver way and ran from the shed, clutching his stomach. The offender then aimed the gun at the others present and asked, “Do you want to die?” He then walked out of the shed and returned a moment later and, holding the butt of the revolver in front of him, handed it to Mr Hudson saying, “Here, do something with this”. The offender then walked to a nearby house and told the occupant that there had been a “serious accident” and asked him to ring the police. He waited at the front of the house for police to arrive. Although an ambulance had been called, Mr Ryan was taken by some of those at the scene at a private hospital at Toronto, then to the Toronto Polyclinic and finally to the local ambulance station where he received assistance before being transported to John Hunter Hospital. He died en route to the hospital. While waiting for the police to arrive, the offender said to Mr Lambton, “I’ve just shot someone. I couldn’t cope any longer. I came to your house because I hoped you would be caring enough to help me. He later said, “I couldn’t cope any longer. He’s been causing so much trouble in the area. I had to do something”. There is no evidence that Mr Ryan had in fact been causing any trouble in the area at all and the offender’s remark may have been a reference to his belief that Mr Ryan had committed the theft to which I have referred and as to which, I reiterate there was not one skerrick of evidence at all.  
    5    The offender was arrested. As I read the evidence, he appeared to be only mildly affected by alcohol. The offender was taken to Toronto police station where a recorded interview was conducted at 2.16am on 7 June 2000. Police located the weapon, which contained five live rounds and one used cartridge case.  
    6    I comment in passing that if ever there was a case which showed that strict gun control is essential for the public safety, this is one.  
    7    The offender admitted to police that he had shot Mr Ryan, although he said that he did not mean to kill him, but was unable to give any explanation as to why he did so. What he said is perhaps best summarised by the following passage - 
     
      
       
       “I lost the plot at my girlfriend’s house and she got all the police and I don’t know, I just wound up down the back at a friend’s house goin’ through my thoughts. I dunno. I just had a gun and I used it. I knew I did the wrong thing as soon as I, I don’t know, I didn’t mean to kill him”.  
       
      
      
     This was repeated a number of times in different ways, but I do not think it necessary to set all this out for present purposes. 
      
    8    The offender was interviewed by a number of consultants for the purpose of these proceedings. He gave to Dr Lucas, a psychiatrist, and Ms Robilliard, a psychologist, essentially the same account. He told them, in essence, that he had been offended by Mr Ryan’s behaviour, including, he thought, the theft to which I have referred in respect of which Mr Ryan’s denials had angered him. The following account is taken from Ms Robilliard’s report - 
     
      
       
       “When Ryan joined the gathering in the shed on the evening of June 6 Stephen said he ‘thought it was a good time to scare him, everyone was sitting around’. He described getting the gun from his bag on the bed and walking towards Ryan with the gun beside his leg. Ryan was sitting on a swivel chair and as Stephen approached he remembered saying in a loud voice ‘I’m going to shoot this cunt’. In fact he said he had no intention of shooting him, that he simply wanted to scare him. He thought Ryan would get up and run when he saw the gun instead of which he states Ryan ‘had a smug look on his face, there was no hint of movement. He seemed very calm’. Stephen said he pointed the gun at Ryan’s head in an attempt to frighten him, and still he did not look frightened or attempt to move. Stephen said he lowered the gun knowing what he was doing was dangerous. He remembers feeling ‘he’s got me again, he’s robbed my house and made a stinking idiot of me’. 
       
      
      
       
       Stephen said he had no intention of killing Ryan and although the gun was not cocked he did squeeze the trigger and it discharged. He stated ‘I meant to wing him in the love handles’ however Stephen maintains Ryan was sitting in a swivel chair and he believes he moved.” 
       
      
    9    The offender explained to Dr Lucas and Ms Robilliard that he loaded the gun because, if it had been empty, Mr Ryan would have known that his threat was not serious and “would have laughed at me”.  
    10    I am inclined to accept that the offender did not intend to kill Mr Ryan, merely to wound him. His plea of guilty, in all the circumstances, must be taken as an admission that he intended to inflict very serious physical injury to Mr Ryan and I do not think it useful to ask whether or not this is consistent with an intention to shoot him in what the offender described as “the love handles”.  
    11    There is no doubt that causing death by inflicting an injury intending to cause grievous bodily harm is a very grave crime. In some circumstances, there may be no difference in culpability between committing a murder with that intention on the one hand, and with the intention of causing death on the other. However, in the circumstances of this case, I consider that the absence of an intention to kill does reduce the seriousness of the offence somewhat and that this should be reflected in the sentence that I impose.  
    12    It appears from the personal histories given to Dr Lucas and Ms Robilliard that the offender has abused alcohol since his pre-teen years, no doubt influenced by the example, it regrettably appears, of both his parents. The offender’s father had alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver and died in hepatic coma although his mother, also an alcoholic, gave up drinking some years ago. The offender told Ms Robilliard that, after his father died (the offender then being about ten years old) he and his brother regularly committed minor crimes involving breaking into the local school and surrounding shops, vandalism and theft. He attended school irregularly although he finished his school certificate with what he claimed to be sound passes in a number of subjects. The offender has six convictions for alcohol-related motor vehicle offences. He has also abused drugs and has been convicted of a number of drug offences. It appears that he has used amphetamine, heroin, and cocaine, amongst other drugs, over the years though, he says, not for some years now. The offender had participated in an alcohol rehabilitation programme for a short time about four months before the offence and it appears that he had remained abstinent until about a month before the offence when he started to drink once more. The subsequent break down of his relationship with Ms Conlon exacerbated his emotional state although, of course, this provides neither explanation nor excuse for Mr Ryan’s murder.  
    13    It appears that the offender has had a number of severe depressive episodes over his adult life, for which it seems he obtained some treatment, although its extent is not clear. He told Professor Starmer that, at the time of the offence he was self-medicating with an anti-depressant marketed as Zoloft, which he stopped taking a few days before the offence. Dr Starmer raised the question in his report whether an abrupt withdrawal from the use of this drug could have had a role in provoking the events that occurred but considered that, although this was a reasonable possibility, there was no evidence which permitted any reliable conclusion to be drawn. Accordingly, I do not think that this is a matter which I should take into account.  
    14    Over the years the offender has been working steadily in a number of occupations, though for the past twelve years or so as a bricklayer and boilermaker. From time to time, the offender had tried rehabilitation by undertaking detoxification programmes with varying but, it seems, short-lived success. 
    15    Overall, I am prepared to accept that the offender’s disposition to violence, especially when he has been drinking, has resulted to a significant degree from his disturbed childhood and adolescent years, exacerbated by a long history of drug and alcohol abuse. It appears that some aspects of his intellectual functioning suggest acquired brain impairment from several causes including alcohol and drug abuse. Dr Lucas considered that the offender’s history justified a diagnosis of anti-social personality disorder although he has usually worked and being employed is important to him. Dr Lucas observed that this disorder tends to improve in the fourth and fifth decades of life. Regrettably, there appears to be no sign yet of this occurring in the offender’s case but, as Dr Lucas said, alcohol abuse may be clouding the picture. Overall, clinical tests administered by Dr W G J Reid, a clinical neuro-psychologist, revealed the offender is of average intellectual ability with some deficits in intellectual functioning although he is still within the average range. 
    16    I have only touched briefly on the offender’s personal history and have not referred to a number of matters set out in the reports which, although they contribute to a picture of his personality, are not necessary to set out in this judgment. I accept that he was born into and raised in a severely dysfunctional family and had few personal resources with which to deal effectively with the challenges of growing up. However, at forty-two years of age, he is a mature man and none of his background mitigates the seriousness of his offence. It is material, however, on the question of his rehabilitation and I accept that, if he is able to deal with his alcohol and drug dependence problems, commission of a serious criminal offence after his release is unlikely. In this regard, his work record shows that he is capable of responsible and mature behaviour. These will be matters which the Parole Board will be in a better position than I am to assess when it comes to consider whether he should be released at the expiration of the non-parole period I intend to impose.  
     
      
    17    The circumstances of the offence as I have set them out, are certainly strange and reflect a degree of disordered thinking, although it is clear that the offender knew what he was doing. His committing this offence in the presence of witnesses is, perhaps, the most obvious indication that he was not thinking clearly. The gravity of the offender’s crime is less, of course, than that of a pre-meditated cold-blooded murder but, that having been said, his offence remains a very grave one indeed. It was an unprovoked, cowardly, brutal act of self-indulgent but extreme violence, in circumstances which excite no sympathy except for his unfortunate victim.  
    18    Several testimonials have been tendered on his behalf. One by a long time friend who had employed him over many years and who, amongst other things, remarks on the difference in the offender’s behaviour when he was affected by alcohol and others by the offender’s mother and Ms Conlon. These confirm a number of matters in his personal history to which I have referred. Also tendered in the proceedings are Victim Impact Statements made by Ben Ryan, the victim’s older brother and Mr and Mrs Ryan. It is clear that they have suffered enormously as a result of Daniel’s death and they will continue to suffer for many years to come. Daniel’s death has, as might be expected, had a devastating effect on them. 
    19    It is important, I think, to point out that, by permitting Victim Impact Statements to be received in a hearing such as this, the law does not thereby place them to be weighed in the scales of justice. I respectfully agree with and adopt the careful reasoning of the Chief Judge at Common Law in R v Previtera (1997) A Crim R 76 at 85 ff as to why this must be so.  
    20    The loss of a life is the gravest injury known to the criminal law. Accordingly, it is not made any more serious because the victim's death is the cause of pain or grief to others, however intensely felt. It would significantly undermine the moral standards essential to the rule of law if the life of one person were to be regarded as more or less valuable than the life of another or the killing of one person as more grievous than the killing of another, because of their personal or social circumstances. All right-thinking people would accept that it would be completely wrong to take one day from an otherwise appropriate sentence for an offence which resulted in death because the deceased was selfish and obnoxious, and without friends or family to grieve for him or her. By exact parity of reasoning, it cannot be right to add a day to an otherwise appropriate sentence because the deceased was generous and kind, loved and surrounded by friends and family who suffered greatly from his or her death. If this were not so, counsel for an offender whose actions caused the death might rationally submit that, as the deceased was of the former character, the crime was less grave and the sentence should be more lenient and the Crown prosecutor, by referring to a grieving family, submit the contrary. The virtues or vices of the deceased, the extent of his or her social connections and whether the death caused grief or passed unnoticed by the indifference of the uninvolved, would then become the subject of evidence and argument. The law will neither value a life nor punish a death by such a demeaning process.  
    21    In Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465, Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ said (at 476) - 
     
      
       
       ""...sentencing is not a purely logical exercise and the troublesome nature of the sentencing discretion arises in large measure from unavoidable difficulty in giving weight to each of the purposes of punishment. The purposes of criminal punishment are various: protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform. The purposes overlap and none of them can be considered in isolation from the others when determining what is an appropriate sentence in a particular case. They are guideposts to the appropriate sentence but sometimes they point in different directions..."" 
       
      
    22    In dealing with offenders, the Court must remain objective and dispassionate. All the relevant facts must be carefully weighed. The circumstances of the crime include not only the result but also the events which gave rise to it, the intentions of the perpetrators, their personal characteristics and attributes and the various explanations for their criminal behaviour.  
    23    The considerations which moderate the measure of punishment, whilst keeping at the forefront the policy objectives of sentencing, do not arise primarily because of what is due to the offender but what is due to ourselves as a civilized and humane community. They reflect not so much respect for the criminal but the self-respect of the community. The principles of reason and humanity which ascribe unqualified value to the life that has been lost require the law also to value the life of the person who comes to be sentenced.  
    24    The offender has tendered a letter, to which no objection was raised by the Crown prosecutor, in which he expresses his heartfelt remorse for what he has done. I accept that he is, indeed, remorseful. He has admitted his responsibility for the crime from the outset. I consider that I should accept that his plea of guilty is also evidence of contrition, even though (as is obvious) his guilt was a foregone conclusion. These are matters that the law requires to be taken into account on sentence. I am also bound to ensure that the sentence is discounted to reflect the utility of the plea of guilty to the administration of justice. This has been said by the Court of Criminal Appeal (and, if I may say so, rightly) to be desirable in the public interest. Having regard to the applicable scale indicated, though not, of course, prescribed, by the Court of Criminal Appeal, I consider that, in the circumstances of this case, an allowance of 25% is appropriate. 
    25    I am obliged also to take into account the fact that the offender has been in custody since the date of the offence and has spent that period on remand, a regime of imprisonment more harsh in a number of respects than that applying to sentenced prisoners. I do not consider that there are any special circumstances that justify a departure from the statutory relationship between sentence and non-parole period. 
    26    Stephen Edward Saari, you are sentenced to a term of sixteen years imprisonment, commencing 6 April 2000. The earliest date upon which you will be eligible for parole is 5 April 2012.

      REGINA v ROBERT MURRAY ANDREWS 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
     1 GROVE J: The applicant appeared before his Honour Judge Coolahan in the Newcastle District Court. He had on the second day of the trial, but before the complainant had given evidence, pleaded guilty to a count of threatening actual bodily harm with an offensive weapon and thereafter having sexual intercourse without consent. His Honour also dealt with a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm to which the applicant had previously pleaded guilty. That offence had involved the same victim and had in fact occurred shortly after the offence which I have first mentioned. His Honour also took into account three counts of deemed supply of prohibited drug. There were three different drugs involved, cannabis, cocaine and amphetamine. These were taken into account on a Form 1. The overall sentence imposed by his Honour was an enveloping term on the first count of six years imprisonment with a non-parole period of four and a half years. The non-parole period was ordered to commence on 22 August 1999, and therefore the applicant would be eligible for parole from 21 February 2004. 
      
       
     2 The applicant is aged now 30 years. He is not without prior record. The more serious offences on his record involve activity with drugs, in 1995 he had been sentenced to two years imprisonment on charges of supplying a prohibited drug. He had been dealt with on two previous occasions for various offences by being released upon recognizances to be of good behaviour. He was not on parole nor the subject of a recognizance at the time of the current offences. 
      
       
     3 It is appropriate to relate some of the facts regarding what I have described as the principal offence. I extract these from the remarks on sentence of Coolahan DCJ. The applicant and the victim had been in a defacto relationship on and off for a number of years. On the date in question they had an argument. It is said, so his Honour observed, to have centred around the victim’s reluctance to drive the applicant about the Singleton area to retrieve money from alleged drug sales made by him. The victim agreed to drive him only after he had threatened to kill her if she did not. They returned to the premises in which they lived, which was at a mine site, at about midnight. The applicant was angry and told the victim that she could not go to bed. He then punched her in the face about four or five times. He then pulled down his jeans and underpants and said to her, “Suck this like the slut you are”. The victim said, “No”. The applicant said, “Do it or I will slit your throat”. At the time the offender indicated to the victim a Samurai-style sword which was next to him on the floor. The victim feared for her life and complied by performing fellatio upon the offender until he allowed her to go to bed. 
      
       
     4 The applicant’s counsel argued three grounds in relation to the appeal. Specifically the first ground asserted that his Honour erred in failing to give sufficient weight to the plea of guilty. It is noted that the sentence was imposed before the publication of judgment by this court in the case of Regina v Thomson 2000 49 NSWLR 383. It is true that his Honour did not attempt to quantify the discount in any published way. It is contended that the sentence of six years in the circumstances where the plea of guilty, although late, warranted a reasonable discount, must have meant that his Honour started at a period of seven or eight years and that that was too high a starting point for the criminality involved. The short recitation of the facts shows that the criminality involved was high indeed.  
      
       
     5 I am unpersuaded that his Honour erred in the assessment which he made. It should be noted that his Honour observed in his remarks on sentence that he was taking into account not only the plea of guilty but the fact that in the circumstances the plea, late though it was, had relieved the victim from the ordeal of giving evidence about what had occurred.  
      
       
     6 The second ground was advanced in terms that the sentence was manifestly excessive. It is noted that what is described as a sexual assault involved fellatio and there was no penile penetration. As the facts which I have recited show, it does not appear that the sexual assault had as its inspiration some need for sexual gratification on the part of the applicant, rather it was part of his activity in asserting his domination over the victim. Reference has been made to a passing observation made by Hunt CJ at CL in Regina v O’Donnell, CCA unreported 1 July 1994, where his Honour said, “Fellatio in my opinion is normally less criminal than say anal or vaginal penetration”. His Honour clearly did not intend that statement to reveal some matter of law, indeed in its terms was expressed only as an opinion and he did not suggest that it was axiomatic. With great respect to his Honour, in my view the penetration of a victim by a sexual organ derives its seriousness from a consideration of the particular circumstances of the case rather than from the nature of the sexual act itself. In this particular case, as I have observed, the act was intended manifestly to humiliate and dominate the victim. In those circumstances I would regard what was done as of a very high order of criminality. On any assessment I would not hold that the sentence was manifestly excessive. 
      
       
     7 The third ground asserted that his Honour erred in particular in the approach that he took to special circumstances and his refusal to find them. Reference was made to part of his remarks on sentence where his Honour observed that the applicant had failed to express remorse and had, arising out of his previous criminal history, not benefited from recognizances or periods on parole in the past. Those were matters which his Honour was entitled to deliberate upon in order to make his finding as to whether or not special circumstances existed such as justified a reduction of the non-parole period. 
      
       
     8 This matter has been the subject of submission in an earlier appeal today and I would respectfully endorse and quote the remarks of Howie J in the case of Regina v Keong 2001 NSWCCA 416 where his Honour said in relation to that case:  
      
       
        
         
         “His Honour’s determination that there were no special circumstances was a finding of fact. However, this is a matter that seems to be treated as a question of law by appellate lawyers. In many cases, as in the present, counsel for the applicant puts before the Court other cases, often judgments of this Court comprising two persons, where findings of special circumstances have been made sometimes in factual situations similar to that before the Court. The fact that another court has found special circumstances in a somewhat similar situation is no more persuasive that there has been an error by the sentencing judge, than is the fact that another court has imposed a different sentence on another offender for a similar offence. They are simply different results arising from different discretionary judgments. This Court is no more entitled to interfere in a finding that there are no special circumstances than in any other finding of fact made by the sentencing judge. If it was open for the judge to come to that finding on the material before the court, it is a fruitless exercise to try to persuade this Court simply to reach a different finding.” 
         
        
       
     9 I am unpersuaded that it was not open to his Honour to come to the finding which he did. Indeed I would observe that were I placed in his Honour’s position I would myself have come to the same conclusion. The court is aware that there have been observations made about the matter of special circumstances, some asserted differences in approach being referred to a bench to be constituted by five judges.  
      
       
     10 Be that as it may, it does not, in my view, affect the outcome of the current proceedings. As I have said, no error is demonstrated in his Honour’s approach and it was open for him to come to the finding which he did. In those circumstances I would propose that the application for leave to appeal be granted but the appeal dismissed. 
      
       
     11 HOWIE J: I agree. 
      
       
     12 GROVE J: The orders of the court will therefore be as I have proposed.

      JUDGMENT 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: 
       
       
      Parties and background 
      
    1    These proceedings concern the management rights to what is now known as the Colonial Stadium, one of Melbourne’s major sporting and entertainment venues which opened in March 2000. At all times material to the events the subject of the proceedings, the first defendant, Baulderstone Hornibrook Pty Limited (“Baulderstone”) was a wholly owned subsidiary of A.W. Baulderstone Holdings Pty Limited, as was the third defendant, Baulderstone Hornibrook International Pty Limited (“International”). The second defendant, Docklands Stadium Consortium Pty Limited (“DSC”) was, in turn, a wholly owned subsidiary of International. Another company relevant but not party to the proceedings, Stadium Operations Limited (“SOL”), was a wholly owned subsidiary of Baulderstone. Baulderstone is a construction company. A.W. Baulderstone Holdings Pty Limited is wholly owned by a German company and is the ultimate holding company of the Baulderstone Group in Australia. 
     
      
    2    It is appropriate, at the outset, to trace the broad chronology of events out of which the present disputes have arisen. 
     
      
    3    During the first half of 1997, Baulderstone was engaged in attempts to form a consortium to bid for the contract to construct and operate the stadium. In the course of doing so and in order to enhance the management (or operation) aspects of its proposed bid, Baulderstone had discussions with the second plaintiff, LMI/HHI Ltd (“LMI”), a Texas limited partnership with which Mr Mike McGee was associated. LMI had established particular expertise in stadium management in the pre-bid, construction and post-opening stages in the United States. LMI had been introduced to Baulderstone by Mr Graeme Watson, the principal of International Sports Facilities Management Pty Limited (“ISFM”), a Sydney based company. 
     
      
    4    In June 1997, the first plaintiff, LMI Australasia Pty Limited (“LMIA”) was identified by Baulderstone as the potential manager of the stadium should a Baulderstone bid be successful. LMIA was a joint venture company owned 50/50 by LMI and ISFM. It was formed for the purposes of the project. At the same time, DSC (also a specially formed company) was introduced by Baulderstone as the vehicle through which the proposed bid for the stadium construction and management contract would be progressed. 
     
      
    5    On or about 27 June 1997, written heads of agreement were entered into between DSC and LMIA. Without wishing, at this stage, to express any conclusions as to the legal status and effect of that document, I shall merely describe it as defining the basis on which LMIA (referred to in the document itself as “LMI”) would take on the task of managing the stadium if DSC’s bid was successful. There are substantial disputes between the parties in relation to the heads of agreement. Of central importance is clause 2.1: 
     
      
       
        
        “If any of the bids are successful, the Developer agrees that it shall appoint LMI as Manager of the Facility.” 
        
       
       
      Clause 2.2 fixed the start of the appointment as the date 24 months before the scheduled “Operations Start Date”. Its initial term was to expire on the twentieth anniversary of the “Operations Start Date”. 
       
      
    6    On 30 June 1997, DSC submitted two bids to the Docklands Authority (“the Authority”), a Victorian statutory body charged with responsibility for bringing the stadium project to fruition as part of a more broadly based redevelopment of the Melbourne docklands. One was a conforming bid and the other a non-conforming (or “preferred”) bid. DSC submitted the bids on behalf of a consortium consisting of itself, KPMG Corporate Finance (Vic) Pty Ltd, ISFM (Mr Watson’s company and a 50% shareholder in LMIA) and Clifton Project Management & Associates Pty Limited. In each bid (that is, the conforming bid and the preferred bid), DSC included a section headed “Consortium Structure”. This outlined in brief terms the contractual arrangements in place among the named consortium members. It contained the following paragraph: 
     
      
       
        
        “In addition, the bid company has entered into a Heads of Agreement with LMI Australasia Pty Ltd regarding its role as operator of the stadium. This agreement and a draft of the Facility Management Agreement for the stadium are contained in Part E of the bid document.” 
        
       
      
    7    On 8 July 1997, DSC made a presentation to the Authority. Mr Simmons of LMI came from the United States for this. Over the following two weeks or so, dialogue continued between the Authority and DSC which, for the purpose, was represented mainly by Baulderstone personnel - principally Mr Steven Wise. No one from LMI or LMIA had direct contact with the Authority after the meeting of 8 July 1997. In the course of that period of two weeks or so, the Authority made it clear that it had reservations about DSC’s bid, mainly because of an inadequate equity content which would leave the Victorian government exposed to financial risk. That concern prompted an approach to Seven Network Limited (“Channel 7”) which agreed to support the DSC consortium by way of a substantial equity contribution to the project, at the same time negotiating a position for itself in relation to television coverage of events at the stadium. 
     
      
    8    On 27 July 1997, DSC lodged with the Authority a bid addendum for both its conforming and preferred bids, together with a covering letter which read in part as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “At our presentation in early July you challenged our Consortium to remove the risk to the Government. We have risen to that challenge. We have delivered a bid that is significantly enhanced which now offers a premium to secure the project.” 
        
       
      
    9    By letter dated 4 August 1997, the Authority informed DSC that the DSC consortium was one of two short listed bidders, the other being the Melbourne Sports Stadium Consortium led by Transfield and Grocon. Also dated 4 August 1997 was a document from the Authority headed “Unsatisfactory Parts of Your Bid as at 4 August 1997”. One of the items in that document was the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “Your management team of LMI/ISFM has no direct Australian Stadium management experience.” 
        
       
      
    10    On or about 5 August 1997, representatives of DSC informed the plaintiffs, through Mr Watson, of the concern raised by the Authority as to the lack of direct Australian stadium management experience. The following day, 6 August 1997, Mr Watson faxed to Mr Wise of Baulderstone a letter which read in part as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “In order to satisfy the Dockland Authority’s concern regarding the operations of LMI/ISFM (no present operation within Australia) we will enter into discussions with Spotless immediately to consider their potential amalgamation in the overall operation of the facility.” 
        
       
      
    11    Spotless, it should be noted, was and is an established company the activities of which include the provision of catering and related facilities at various locations, including sporting and entertainment venues. Spotless was soon afterwards approached by Mr Watson with a view to gauging its interest in playing an appropriate role in support of the DSC bid. Spotless was, at that stage, unable to commit itself because of a pre-existing involvement in the Transfield/Grocon bid. Spotless nevertheless made it clear that it would be interested in playing a role in relation to the DSC bid should it become free from its commitments to Transfield/Grocon. Mr Watson informed Mr Wise of the Spotless position. 
     
      
    12    As a separate measure, steps were taken to bolster the local experience base of LMIA by recruiting Mr Spangler who was at the time the chief executive of the organisation which operated the Melbourne Tennis Centre, site of the Australian Open, one of the Grand Slam tennis tournaments. 
     
      
    13    On or soon after 22 August 1997, DSC received from the Authority, in preparation for a meeting scheduled for 25 August 1997, a document headed “Outstanding Key Stadium Issues as at 22 August 1997”. One item on the list was “Superior management proposal” against which, in an “Action” column, appeared “DSC”. 
     
      
    14    On 1 September 1997, the Authority announced that DSC was the successful bidder. Four days previously, on 28 August 1997, SOL was formed. It was, as I have said, a wholly owned subsidiary of Baulderstone. On 3 September 1997, an agreement entitled Stadium Development Agreement was executed, the parties to it being the Authority, a company in the A.W. Baulderstone Group called Stadium Management Limited, National Mutual Trustees Limited and SOL. The second and third were respectively the manager and the trustee of a unit trust established for the purposes of the transaction. They, together with SOL, were designated “Developer”. Clause 1.11 provides that the obligations and duties of the Developer may be performed or discharged “by any one or more of the entities comprising the Developer”. Clause 15 of the agreement is headed “Project Co-ordination and Stadium Management”. Included in that clause is the following clause 15.6: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Developer must execute a Stadium Management Agreement with the appointed Stadium Manager by no later than 30 days before the date for Practical Completion and must perform and observe all obligations imposed upon it by the Stadium Management Agreement. 
        
       
       
        
        Before appointing a Stadium Manager and executing a Stadium Management Agreement, the Developer will consult in good faith with the Authority and, so far as the Authority reasonably requires, the AFL, with a view to ensuring that the management arrangements to be contained in the Stadium Management Agreement reflect commercial arm’s length arrangements equivalent to the arrangements that it would be reasonable to expect the Developer could have negotiated were the appointment of the Stadium Manager to have been conducted by way of a competitive tender open to Australian and international operators and managers of stadia equivalent to the Stadium.” 
        
       
      
    15    “AFL” is a reference to the Australian Football League. The term “Stadium Manager” is not defined, but the definition of “Stadium Management Agreement” is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Stadium Management Agreement means an agreement generally in the form contained in Schedule 12.” 
        
       
       
      Schedule 12 contains a form of agreement between SOL and LMIA. More will be said in due course about that form of agreement and the genesis of clause 15.6. 
       
      
    16    On 10 August 1998, the agreement contemplated by clause 15.6 of the Stadium Development Agreement was made. But the appointed manager was not LMIA. It was Nationwide Venue Management Pty Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Spotless. LMI Melbourne Pty Limited (a wholly owned subsidiary of LMIA) was appointed a consultant to Nationwide Venue Management and agreed to provide defined services in support of that company’s activities as manager of the stadium. When LMI Melbourne accepted this appointment, LMIA expressly reserved its rights under the heads of agreement. The appointment was, in June 2000, terminated in accordance with the agreement when Nationwide Venue Management ceased to be manager of the stadium.  
     
      
       
      The plaintiffs’ claims 
       
      
    17    Arising out of these circumstances, LMI and LMIA have made several claims against the defendants. The first is a claim for breach by DSC of a contract said to be constituted by the heads of agreement of June 1997, the breach consisting of failure by DSC to ensure that LMIA was appointed manager of the stadium in accordance with clause 2. Second, there is a claim against Baulderstone and International for inducing this breach of the contract constituted by the heads of agreement. 
     
      
    18    The third claim is a claim for payment or reimbursement of certain expenses incurred by LMI and LMIA for services and assistance provided during the pre-award stage. This claim is advanced in a threefold way: first, under a contract, second, on the basis of conventional estoppel and, third, on the basis of restitutionary principles. 
     
      
    19    The core issues arising in relation to the first claim are, first, whether the heads of agreement were a contract, second, as to the operation and effect of that contract (including any implied terms) and, third, whether any contract is void for uncertainty. The second claim raises additional issues, including issues as to the knowledge that should be attributed to certain bodies corporate. I shall deal with the various elements of the first and second claims before turning to the claim for reimbursement of expenses. 
     
      
       
      Contractual effect of the heads of agreement 
       
      
    20    In arguing that the heads of agreement constitute a contract, the plaintiffs point immediately to recital E: 
     
      
       
        
        “If any of the Bids are successful the parties intend to enter into a formal Facility Management Agreement, but, in the meantime, intend this Heads of Agreement to be legally binding.” 
        
       
      
    21    It is not disputed that both DSC and LMIA subscribed to the document and thus to the apparent statement of mutual intention that it be legally binding. The statement is, as the plaintiffs point out, reinforced by the way in which DSC later described and presented the heads of agreement. In the bids it submitted to the Authority, the following statement appeared: 
     
      
       
        
        “In addition, the bid company has entered into a Heads of Agreement with LMI Australia Pty Ltd regarding its role as operator of the stadium. This agreement, and a draft of the Facility Management Agreement for the stadium are contained in Part E of the bid document.” 
        
       
      
    22    This description of the heads of agreement as “This agreement” in a sentence also referring to a “draft” of some other agreement may be taken to demonstrate DSC’s acceptance of their contractual nature. The subsequent statement is admissible on the question whether a contract was formed: see Brambles Holdings Ltd v Bathurst City Council [2001] NSWCA 61 at [25] per Heydon JA. Furthermore, Mr Wise, the Baulderstone officer principally involved in the affairs of DSC, admitted in cross-examination that, in his mind, the heads of agreement were a legally binding contract. 
     
      
    23    It is to be noted, however, that the document itself is entitled “heads of agreement” and, to that extent, may be taken to indicate that it is of a preliminary nature only. Speaking of the words “in principle” included in the parties’ description of their compact in Baulkham Hills Private Hospital Pty Ltd v G R Securities Pty Ltd (1986) 5 BPR 9315, McHugh JA said that “they cannot prevail against the conclusion to be drawn from the words ‘a legally binding agreement’”. Here, the qualifying expression is “heads of agreement” rather than “agreement in principle”. That, to my mind, does not detract from the force of the statement in the recital that, pending the making of a formal facility management agreement, the parties intend the document to be legally binding. What it does do, however, is focus attention on the aspect of the recital showing that the heads of agreement do not represent the parties’ contractual last word.  
     
      
    24    Recital E makes it clear that the parties contemplated a subsequent binding contract. That raises a question of classification of the heads of agreement according to the four classes identified in Masters v Cameron (1954) 91 CLR 353 as supplemented by McLelland J at first instance in Baulkham Hills Private Hospital by reference to Sinclair Scott & Co Ltd v Naughton (1929) 43 CLR 310: 
     
      
       
      Class 1: Where the parties have reached finality in arranging all the terms of their bargain and intend to be immediately bound to the performance of those terms, but at the same time propose to have the terms restated in a form which will be fuller or more precise but not different in effect. 
       
       
      Class 2: Where the parties have completely agreed upon all the terms of their bargain and intend no departure from or addition to that which their agreed terms express or imply, but nevertheless have made performance of one or more of the terms conditional upon the execution of a formal document. 
       
       
      Class 3: Where the intention of the parties is not to make a concluded bargain at all, unless and until they execute a formal contract. 
       
       
      Class 4: Where the parties are content to be bound immediately and exclusively by the terms which they have agreed upon whilst expecting to make a further contract in substitution for the first contract containing, by consent, additional terms. 
       
      
    25    A decision as to where the heads of agreement fit within this scheme will be assisted by an examination of features in addition to the two obvious ones to which I have already referred (being the description “heads of agreement” and the statement of intention in recital E). Beyond that, there were several aspects which served to emphasise the preliminary and, to an extent, incomplete nature of the arrangement recorded. Mr Campbell QC, senior counsel for the defendants, pointed to a number of such matters. I refer to them not in any order of significance or importance. 
     
      
    26    Clause 3.1 makes it the responsibility of LMIA to “provide the Management Services”, that is, “the services to be provided by LMI [that is, LMIA] in managing the Facility” including in particular those listed in schedules 1 and 2. Those schedules do not sit happily with the body of the document. It is clear from the evidence that they were simply lifted from an earlier draft agreement prepared by LMI’s lawyers in the United States. They contain one blank space (for a number of days), one section in square brackets which appear to make it provisional or draft in nature, a reference to an undefined “Consortium” and six cross references, by number, to provisions which either do not exist or do not relate to the subject matter at hand. 
     
      
    27    A number of matters are left for subsequent agreement. There is provision for the initial term of 20 years to be extended if LMIA “is satisfactorily achieving agreed performance and operational standards”. There is also provision for the parties to agree budgets before the start of each year. Moneys collected by LMIA are to be deposited into an account “in an agreed Bank” out of which certain designated payments are to be made as well as “other payments agreed with” DSC, with the balance being remitted to DSC “at regular intervals as agreed from time to time”. There is provision for the payment to LMIA of “a Performance Compensation Fee based on the net profit of the Facility” and the parties “agree to confer and co-operate in good faith to agree upon an appropriate formula for calculation of such a fee”. LMIA’s right to reimbursement of pre-appointment expenses extends to those “agreed with the Developer”. There are provisions under which the parties “shall agree upon” capital improvement budgets, “appropriate insurances” and a standard form of contract for concessions (although the last is qualified by the words “as far as practicable”). In none of these instances is there any machinery to fill the relevant gap if the parties do not agree. 
     
      
    28    Next, there are several core provisions dealing with “Operating Expenses” and “Operating Revenues”. Part of LMIA’s responsibility is to perform its functions so as to minimise Operating Expenses and maximise Operating Revenues in the best interests of DSC. The provisions concerning budgets contemplate that such budgets will list “all projected Operating Revenues and Operating Expenses”. The bank account provisions refer to collection and deposit of Operating Expenses, as do the provisions about reporting by LMIA. Despite the fact that these terms start with capital letters, there are no definitions of “Operating Revenues” and “Operating Expenses”. The document makes it clear that definitions were at one stage intended but were deleted. 
     
      
    29    Finally, there is a provision in which LMIA acknowledges its awareness of the terms of three other agreements and agrees that, in providing the management services, it will comply with the terms of each “and the provisions of this agreement shall be read down accordingly”. The three agreements mentioned are “the AFL User Agreement” (which is defined as a particular agreement dated 1 April 1997 between the Authority and the Australian Football League), “the Stadium Usage Agreement” (which is defined as the agreement referred to in schedule 4 to the AFL User Agreement and which therefore may be taken to have existed at the time) and “the Lease”. The last is defined as the lease “to be entered into” between DSC and the Authority for a term of not less than 40 years but otherwise with no indication as to its terms or content. 
     
      
    30    The capacity for matters of these kinds (particularly lacunae with no specified means of being filled) to deny legal force to a compact otherwise apparently intended to have such force is illustrated by the decision of the Court of Appeal in Coal Cliff Collieries Pty Ltd v Sijehama Pty Ltd (1991) 24 NSWLR 1. That case, like this, involved a document termed “heads of agreement”. That document was, by its terms, to be superseded by a detailed agreement to be negotiated but so that the negotiation “shall not in the meantime in any way prejudice the full and binding effect of what is now agreed”. Kirby P, in whose judgment Waddell AJA concurred, went through the heads of agreement clause by clause, identifying features tending for and against a conclusion of present contractual force despite the clear contemplation of a future and superseding contract. 
     
      
    31    When the same exercise is undertaken here, it seems to me clear that the indications in favour of present contractual force prevail, despite a number of uncertainties and gaps; also that those uncertainties and gaps are not, individually or together, sufficient to deprive the whole of coherent contractual meaning. The schedules 1 and 2, with their one blank space and inappropriate cross-referencing, are easy enough to understand. The period of days which has been left blank should be construed as a reasonable period and the subject matter of the cross-referencing makes it reasonably clear which substantive provision is intended. The provisions dealing with “Operating Expenses” and “Operating Revenues” in the absence of definitions of those terms are quite intelligible, given that the two expressions may be regarded as having readily discernible ordinary meanings in the context of management and operation of something such as a stadium. This is in accord with the approach taken by the High Court to the undefined term “supplier’s costs” in a commercial agreement in Upper Hunter County District Council v Australian Chilling & Freezing Co Ltd (1968) 118 CLR 429. The clause by which LMIA acknowledges its awareness of and agrees to comply with nominated agreements are likewise intelligible and meaningful in relation to the two agreements which existed when the heads of agreement were signed. 
     
      
    32    Two aspects require closer analysis. The first is the provision by which LMIA acknowledges its awareness of and agrees to comply with an agreement not in existence, being “the Lease”. That provision also causes the heads of agreement to be read down to the extent necessary to allow full and unqualified operation to the provisions of the non-existent “Lease”. The provision thus operates not only to require certain conduct on the part of LMIA but also to modify the effect of the heads of agreement. The latter aspect must be seen as operating in the future in relation to “the Lease”. The provision ensures that, to the extent of any inconsistency which emerges when the lease comes into existence, the terms of the heads of agreement will then yield. The provision thus has a cogent and meaningful operation despite the non-existence of “the Lease”. 
     
      
    33    The other aspect which requires particular attention is the collection of provisions which contemplate future agreement on particular matters. The guiding principle in such cases was stated by Lloyd LJ (with whom the other members of the Court of Appeal agreed) in Pagnan SpA v Feed Products Ltd [1987] 2 Lloyds Rep 601: 
     
      
       
        
        “But there is no legal obstacle which stands in the way of the parties agreeing to be bound now while deferring important matters to be agreed later. It happens every day when parties enter into so-called ‘heads of agreement’.” 
        
       
      
    34    It is thus clear that the presence of elements amounting to “agreement to agree” is not fatal to the existence of a contract. I do not lose sight of the observation of Gibbs CJ, Murphy and Wilson JJ in Booker Industries Pty Ltd v Wilson Parking (Qld) Pty Ltd (1982) 149 CLR 600:  
     
      
       
        
        “It is established by authority, both ancient and modern, that the courts will not lend their aid to the enforcement of an incomplete agreement, being no more than an agreement of the parties to agree at some time in the future. Consequently, if the lease provided for a renewal ‘at a rental to be agreed’ there would clearly be no enforceable agreement.” 
        
       
      
    35    Such lack of definition and consensus will be fatal to the existence of a contract only if it is pervasive. The matter was put thus by Gleeson CJ in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v XIVth Commonwealth Games Ltd (1988) 18 NSWLR 353: 
     
      
       
        
        “[I]n the ordinary case, as a matter of fact and common sense, other things being equal, the more numerous and significant the areas in respect of which the parties have failed to reach agreement, the slower a court will be to conclude that they had the requisite contractual intention.” 
        
       
       
      There is, in other words, a point beyond which “agreement to agree” elements (of themselves unenforceable) cause the totality to fail. The central question, it seems to me, is whether the elements not affected by that problem of unenforceability are sufficiently cohesive and coherent to stand as a contract in their own right. This is probably another way of addressing the question whether elements so affected may be severed in accordance with principles discussed in cases such as  
      Whitlock v Brew 
       (1968) 118 CLR 445 and  
      David Jones Ltd v Lunn 
       (1969) 91 WN (NSW) 468. 
       
      
    36    The items left for future agreement by the heads of agreement are such that, if no agreement emerges on any of them, there will be no means of implementing any extension beyond the initial 20 years, there will be uncertainty about the bank at which the bank account is to be maintained, there will be no definition of payments to be made out of that account beyond the specifically designated payments and there will be no basis for the calculation of any performance compensation fee. I have passed over here the provisions envisaging agreement as to budgets, insurances and a form of contract for concessions. I have done so because I regard those elements as of a different kind, in that the subject matter is of its nature changeable so that it is not meaningful to think of a single and definitive prescription at the commencement of a 20 year term. The parties are really flagging, in these areas, matters upon which they will need to consult and agree periodically in the light of changing circumstances as the term progresses. 
     
      
    37    Having regard to and allowing for the “agreement to agree” elements not of the periodic nature to which I have just referred, it is clear that the remaining elements of the heads of agreement are sufficiently cohesive and coherent to stand as a contract in their own right. The functions and responsibilities of LMIA as manager are defined, as is the term (at least to the extent of the initial period of 20 years). The other central feature, being the fee payable to LMIA as manager is stated clearly: it is $23,000 per month until the “Operations Start Date” and $500,000 per year thereafter, with the annual fee being adjusted upwards annually in line with any increase in the consumer price index. There are also meaningful and complete provisions on record keeping and reporting. The heads of agreement, unlike those considered in Coal Cliff Collieries (above), do not present a need to supply elements dependent upon guesses or predictions about how “executives, attending to the interests of their corporation and its shareholders might act in negotiating such a transaction ….”. The basic transaction in this case was not of great complexity and was, in many ways, conceptually akin to a contract of employment or contract for services where the central terms are often so straightforward as to require little by way of writing. 
     
      
    38    My conclusion, therefore, is that the heads of agreement acquired contractual force when executed and that this was so despite the contrary indications to which I have referred. In terms of the Masters v Cameron classes, the heads of agreement fall into either the first or the fourth. For present purposes, I do not consider it necessary to be more precise than this. 
     
      
       
      The condition precedent in clause 2.1 
       
      
    39    DSC’s obligation under clause 2.1 of the heads of agreement is an obligation to appoint LMI as manager of the stadium. Mr Campbell QC conceded that this includes an obligation on the part of DSC to ensure that any associated company acquiring the power to appoint should exercise that power by appointing LMIA. But DSC’s obligation is conditioned by the opening words of clause 2.1: “If any of the Bids are successful”. These same words introduce recital E which records the intention of DSC and LMIA to enter into a formal facility management agreement. They are also used in recital C which refers to the parties’ agreement that LMIA will be appointed manager of the facility. 
     
      
    40    The meaning to be attributed to “If any of the Bids are successful” must be gathered from the circumstances which existed when the heads of agreement were concluded. The question whether the condition was satisfied requires examination of the facts concerning the bidding process and its outcome. 
     
      
    41    The meaning of “the Bids” is elaborated by the definition in clause 1.1: 
     
      
       
        
        “ ‘Bid’ or ‘Bids’ means the conforming bid and the non-conforming bid or bids to be made by the Developer (or by Baulderstone on behalf of the Developer) to the Docklands Authority for the purposes of the Developer being selected to fund, develop, own and operate the Facility.” 
        
       
      
    42    Colour is added by recitals A and B: 
     
      
       
        
        “A. The Developer is presently developing the Bids (in competition with two other consortia) for the Facility. 
        
       
       
        
         B. The Bids are to be submitted to the Docklands Authority on or before 30 June 1997.” 
        
       
      
    43    The system under which bids were developed and submitted is detailed in the Authority’s document of April 1997 entitled “Melbourne Docklands Stadium Form of the Bid Proposal”. This system envisaged both conforming and non-conforming bids. In either case, however, the bid was not seen as an offer capable of acceptance. Rather, it 
     
      
       
        
        “… will form part of the basis on which preferred developers will be selected by the Authority”. 
        
       
      
    44    The Authority’s objective was stated thus: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Authority may choose to negotiate with a developer any combination of conforming and non-conforming bid options in a Development Agreement.” 
        
       
      
    45    The categories of evaluation of bids were stated as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        
       
      
    · Design and amenity; 
     
      
    · Integration; 
     
      
    · Financial/Risk; 
     
      
    · Viability; 
     
      
    · Proposed quality of design and construction and programme for the construction and commissioning; 
     
      
    · Proposed quality of management, operations, market attractiveness, competitiveness, and maintenance and capital upgrade programmes; and 
     
      
    · Other.” 
     
      
    46    The Authority’s expectations concerning treatment of stadium management in a bid should be quoted in full: 
     
      
       
        
        “PART E – MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS PLAN 
        
       
       
        
        This section must provide a clear and detailed description of the proposed Stadium Manager/Operator, including its experience, approach and business plan. The scope and quality of the services to be provided should be described in detail. This detailed plan for managing the Stadium and its customers is to demonstrate how the manager will achieve world’s best practice in all areas of Stadium management and operations. 
        
       
       
        
        This section will also detail how the Stadium manager will consider the needs of spectators, media and users. 
        
       
       
        
        Developers will need to ensure that contractual documentation with their proposed manager reflects the contractual obligations of the successful developer, as reflected in the  
        Stadium Development Agreement Documentation 
        ,  
        AFL 
          
        User Agreement 
         and other user agreements as determined. This will include ensuring pourage rights, sponsorship rights and signage rights are consistent with the user agreements for each of the major sporting bodies. The Stadium Manager will be required to provide a minimum standard of services to users in accordance with the  
        Stadium Development Agreement Documentation  
         and  
        AFL User Agreement 
         and other user agreements as determined. 
        
       
       
        
        Developers are to provide draft contractual documentation with their proposed manager for approval by the Authority.” 
        
       
       
      
    47    The part to be played by the contract to be entered into with a manager identified in the bid was the subject of particular comment in the documents made available by the Authority to prospective bidders. One such document (Exhibit 7 to the witness statement of Mr Mitchell) listed several criteria against which bids would be assessed. Under a heading concerned with management and operation of the stadium after construction, four criteria were identified: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        
       
      
    · the developer’s team; 
     
      
    · the relevant experience of the proposed Manager/Operator; 
     
      
    · the Management and Operations Plan to be provided as part of a developer’s Bid Proposal; and 
     
      
    · the Maintenance and Capital Upgrade programme to be provided as part of a developer’s Bid Proposal.” 
     
      
    48    Further insight into the Authority’s thinking on how the management issue would be handled after bids had been received is provided by the executive summary extracted as Exhibit 8 to Mr Mitchell’s witness statement. The concluding assumption in that extract is particularly significant. The extract is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Development Agreement makes provision for a form of Stadium Management Agreement to be entered into by the selected developer and a suitable manager, but the form of this agreement is not presently prescribed and it is assumed that management arrangements will form an important part of the negotiations with the short-listed bidders.” 
        
       
      
    49    The Authority thus created a framework in which interested parties were invited to submit proposals which the Authority would then examine and evaluate with a view to selecting one or more parties to engage in a process of negotiation. While the Authority no doubt assumed certain legally enforceable duties regarding its conduct of the process (cf Hughes Aircraft Systems International v Airservices Australia (1997) 76 FCR 151), that process was obviously of such a nature that a bid could not be a simple “take it or leave it” matter. A bid could not be “successful” through its simple acceptance. Some more complex meaning of “successful” must have been contemplated by clause 2.1 of the heads of agreement. 
     
      
    50    The evidence makes it clear that the process of post-bid negotiation with short listed candidates envisaged by the Authority’s framework was undertaken in relation to the bids submitted by DSC. It was that process which brought about the execution of the Stadium Development Agreement. Whereas DSC had lodged the original bids, it was SOL (together with two other entities) which, as “Developer”, entered into the Stadium Development Agreement. That was a by-product of the financial structuring eventually adopted. Recital C to the Stadium Development Agreement says that DSC submitted its bids “on behalf of” the three corporations making up “the Developer”. The same is said in its definition of “Bid Proposal”. This is a fiction, given that one of the three (SOL) did not exist when DSC’s bids were submitted and that the other two did not at that time have a connection with the project. The fiction was designed to suggest continuity between the bids in fact submitted by DSC and the outcome in favour of SOL and the two other corporations making up “the Developer” as eventually constituted. 
     
      
    51     The Stadium Development Agreement also demonstrates a very distinct shift in the area of stadium management. DSC’s bids were on the footing that the manager would be LMIA with which DSC had entered into the heads of agreement. A clear cut management arrangement was represented as being in place and was adopted by DSC’s bids. The Stadium Management Agreement did not incorporate or embrace that arrangement. Clause 15.6 is set out above. It imposes two substantive obligations on SOL and the two other parties constituting “the Developer”. First, there is an obligation to enter into “a Stadium Management Agreement with the appointed Stadium Manager” within a certain time. Second, there is an obligation to consult in good faith with the Authority on certain matters before “appointing a Stadium Manager and executing a Stadium Management Agreement”.  
     
      
    52    Both these aspects draw upon the definition of “Stadium Management Agreement” which is also set out above and directs attention to schedule 12 where there appears a form of agreement between SOL and LMIA. The content of that form of agreement (which, as stated, is an integral part of the Stadium Development Agreement) throws further light on the connection between the bids centred on DSC and the outcome centred on SOL and the other two corporations. There is again, in recital A, a reference to the fiction that DSC submitted a bid “on behalf of” someone else, although on this occasion it is only SOL which is mentioned as the principal. It is then recited in bald terms, “The Bid has been successful”. A subsequent recital states that “DSC and LMI [ie, LMIA] entered the Heads of Agreement on the # day of June 1997 in relation to the management of the Facility”. There then follow recitals H and I:  
     
      
       
        
        “H. Now that the Bid has been successful the parties wish to enter into a formal Agreement, which supersedes the Heads of Agreement, to record the terms upon which LMI shall manage the Facility for and on behalf of SOL. 
        
       
       
        
         I. The Docklands Authority has approved the terms of this Agreement as required by Clause 3.1 of the Lease.” 
        
       
      
    53    It is significant that this form of agreement is part of the Stadium Development Agreement and that the whole of the content of the form of agreement – in particular, the recitals to which I have referred – is the subject of promises taken by the Authority from the Developer (SOL and the other two corporations) in clause 15.6 of the Stadium Development Agreement. By causing the form of agreement to which LMIA was party to be part of their Stadium Development Agreement and giving and receiving contractual promises by reference to it, the Authority and SOL (together with the two other constituents of the Developer) re-affirmed, as among themselves, the fiction that the bids in fact lodged by DSC had been lodged by it on behalf of the Developer and subscribed to the simple statement in the recitals to the form of agreement that a bid lodged by DSC had “been successful”.  
     
      
    54    In truth, however, there were substantial differences between the basis set out in the DSC bids and the basis eventually reflected in the Stadium Development Agreement. This was particularly so in the area of financing and in relation to the operator or manager. The Authority saw shortcomings in the DSC bids in relation to these matters. Those bids left the Government with a significant financial risk on the funding side. In relation to management, they involved an unequivocal commitment to LMIA (as a joint venture between LMI and ISFM). From the earliest discussions after DSC had become one of the two short listed parties with which negotiations were to proceed, the Authority made it clear that those two aspects of the DSC proposal were not satisfactory to it. The concern about the first caused a restructuring of the consortium and its financial arrangements so that equity and debt providers were introduced. In fact, those parties (particularly Channel 7) then came, not unnaturally perhaps, to play a significant role in negotiations with the Authority at the expense of the influence enjoyed to that point by Baulderstone. 
     
      
    55    The Authority’s concern about management centred upon the lack of relevant Australian experience by LMIA (or, more specifically, LMI and ISFM). The commitment to LMIA proposed by DSC was unacceptable to the Authority. Once that concern became known, LMIA or its principals took steps to bolster the Australian experience base of LMIA by recruiting Mr Spangler. Coincidentally, LMI/ISFM won at that time the management rights in respect of the multi-use arena which was in the course of construction as part of the Sydney Olympic Park, venue of the Olympic Games to be held in 2000. But neither of these developments allayed the Authority’s concerns. Mr Spangler’s experience was regarded as lying in an essentially different field involving a much smaller venue divorced from Australian football which would be the staple of the stadium. The Sydney appointment was seen as neutral or perhaps marginally negative: it presented the potential for the LMIA effort and effectiveness to be dissipated and, in any event, involved a role in which LMIA still had to prove itself. 
     
      
    56    The main effort on attempts at resolving the Authority’s twofold concerns (equity and management) was devoted to the equity side. This effort eventually resulted in a major restructuring of the financial arrangements. The management issue kept coming up as an agenda item at meetings through which the negotiation consequent upon the lodgment of the DSC bids was conducted. But it was not until the final days of that process, when time constraints were pressing because it had been announced that the result would be disclosed on 1 September 1997, that a solution based on clause 15.6 of the Stadium Development Agreement was devised.  
     
      
    57    That solution involved a departure from the Authority’s original expectation that the issue of management would be resolved in the negotiation arising from a submitted bid, even to the extent of examining and settling the form of draft management agreement a bidder was required to include in the bid. The departure was necessary because of the Authority’s continuing and unresolved worry about the LMI/ISFM management proposal and the practical impossibility of working out anything else in the short time still available. Mr Wise’s explanation in examination in chief of the way in which clause 15.6 came about was as follows (referring to a meeting with Authority representatives on 25 or 26 August 1997): 
     
      
       
        
        “CAMPBELL: Q. We are asking for what was said at the meeting? 
         
        A. Mr Tabart told us that the operating solution remained an unsatisfactory part of our bid and that they required a solution that meant the bid brief of both local capacity and international experience. We talked about – sorry, Mr Tabart suggested that a tender process after the preferred bidder status was a way of dealing with it in a way that was satisfactory to the Docklands Authority. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did he say anything about what was involved in this tender process? 
         
        A. Mr Tabart required a clause to be agreed that gave him comfort that the operating solution was the best available to the stadium to deliver, the stadium, after the preferred bidder stage.” 
        
       
      
    58    Mr Tabart was at the time and still is the chief executive of the Authority. Mr Tabart gave evidence. He agreed that the clause 15.6 approach was decided “right at the end of the process when a lot of things were being tidied up in all areas”. His account of the origins of clause 15.6 was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Picking up what you have said to his Honour then, what are you able to say on the topic that you mentioned of how to provide a better management solution? 
         
        A. Because their proposal in this area was unsatisfactory to us, Australian experience, on the ground in operating stadia similar to what this was going to become, we sought for them to improve their proposal in whatever way they could. We sought for them to eventually describe a process within which we would be consulted on how they might appoint a manager or an operator after winning the bid, if they won the bid. That was agreed to, clause work was agreed. It was put into the agreement which they then executed, and subsequently they did win the bid. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So far as the discussions that you have referred to about a clause which provided for the appointment of a manager after winning the bid, what are you able to tell his Honour about the substance of that sort of discussion? 
         
        A. It was a clause that referred to the qualities of the stadium operator that would be appointed, and a process by which it would happen, a process which I think words like “arms length” were there to ensure that it was not just a subsidiary of the winning bid group, and it was truly an arms length agreement. It was negotiated with players in a circumstance that might be similar to that that would come out, would result from a competitive process for calling bids for a stadium manager and operator. It was all designed to give us the comfort that the consortium, with a lot of equity in this project, would be seeking a suitable manager and skilled operator anyway. This was the way in which we felt that put the pressure on them after the event, and we would be consulted.” 
        
       
      
    59    In the course of cross-examination, Mr Tabart said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You understood that the proposal up to this change was that LMI would be the operator, did you not, the proposal had been put forward? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. There had been a change, wasn’t there, round about late August as far as you were concerned, because your understanding of this clause was that the question of the operator was to be deferred? 
         
        A. I wouldn’t use those words. What I would say is there was an agreement to allow an operator to be selected after the bid, if they won the bid and there was a process by which that would happen, whether LMI were involved in that or not was up to what happened afterwards.” 
        
       
      
    60    Clause 15.6 was drafted by Mr Stewart, a partner of Arthur Robinson & Hedderwicks, the firm which was retained in late July 1997 to act for the bidding group. Mr Stewart gave evidence. He said that the instructions to draft clause 15.6 were given to him by Mr Wise. His account of the origins of the clause was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Is it fair for his Honour to assume however that whatever the precise nature of the concerns articulated by the Docklands Authority at that meeting, you believed that your drafting of clause 15.6 would meet those concerns? 
         
        A. I – we approached clause 15.6 and the issue it raised perhaps in a slightly different way to the Docklands Authority’s preference, in the sense that it raised issues which we believed could be dealt with at a later stage in the process, insofar as it dealt with substantive issues about the contractual arrangements for the operation and management of the stadium, and therefore -- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did I cut you off? 
         
        A. I was just going to say and therefore we sought to convince the Docklands Authority that it was appropriate for the finalisation of the operation and management arrangements to be done after the awarding of the bid.” 
        
       
       
      He later said: 
       
       
        
        “CAMPBELL: Q. You said, ‘We approached clause 15.6 and the issues it raised in a different way to the Docklands Authority’s preference’. What did you mean by that answer, in a different way to the Docklands Authority’s preference? 
         
        A. What I meant was that the Docklands Authority had issued drafts of the stadium development agreement, which contemplated that an operating and management agreement would be finalised at the time the stadium development agreement was executed. We sought to convince them that that was unnecessary on the timetable that the bid was being run to, and that it would – the operation and maintenance arrangements could best be dealt with post the award of the bid.” 
        
       
      
    61    It is thus clear that, in the minds of Mr Wise, Mr Tabart and Mr Stewart, the DSC bids were not satisfactory to the Authority while the LMIA management role remained an integral part of them. It is also clear that, as those three witnesses saw things, the approach based on clause 15.6 was necessary to overcome this and that that approach left not only the terms of a management agreement but also the selection of the manager for future decision. Although clause 15.6, on its face, does not necessarily seem to work that way (based, as it is, on the schedule 12 form in which LMIA is actually named), closer analysis shows that it does. This is despite the fact that clause 15.6 operates by reference to the schedule 12 form and that that form is an agreement between SOL and LMIA containing recitals referring to the relationship between DSC and LMIA created by the heads of agreement and, with the aid of the agency fiction which I have mentioned, seeking to provide a link of continuity between the heads of agreement relationship and the execution of the final agreement in the schedule 12 form.  
     
      
    62    The first obligation imposed by clause 15.6 is an obligation to “execute a Stadium Management Agreement with the appointed Stadium Manager”. There is thus an indication that some form of appointment of a stadium manager will have occurred before the agreement is executed. It seems, therefore, that “appointed” really means “selected”. That meaning is reinforced by the second paragraph of clause 15.6 which imposes a requirement which must be observed or performed before “a Stadium Manager” is appointed and “a Stadium Management Agreement” is executed. The execution of the agreement is thus not seen as the means by which the appointment is effected. There are clear indications that there is to be a selection process of a kind inconsistent with the notion (emerging from schedule 12) that LMIA will be appointed come what may. 
     
      
    63    To the extent that there is any ambiguity on this in the words themselves, evidence of surrounding circumstances existing at the time of its formation may be taken into account in construing the Stadium Development Agreement: Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of New South Wales (1982) 149 CLR 337 and see Heydon JA’s first principle in Brambles Holdings v Bathurst City Council (above). There is here ample evidence that the Authority had declined to accept LMIA as manager and that the promoters of the bid had, with its concurrence, set about documenting a way of deferring the choice of manager until after the Stadium Development Agreement had been executed. 
     
      
    64    Another point to be noted is that, whilst clause 15.6 operates by reference to “a Stadium Management Agreement”, it does not compel exact adherence to the schedule 12 form. “Stadium Management Agreement” is defined as meaning an agreement “generally in the form contained in Schedule 12”. The word “generally” shows that there may be departures and that the schedule 12 form, while more than guidance, is not definitive. This is another basis on which the references to LMIA as a party and to the recitals may be relegated to a non-essential position. 
     
      
    65    A third point indicating that the schedule 12 form is by no means definitive is the substantive effect of clause 15.6 itself. The pre-condition to the obligation to appoint a Stadium Manager and to execute a Stadium Management Agreement is consultation with a view to ensuring that “the arrangements to be contained in” the agreement are of the relevant arm’s length description. There is a clear expectation here that, if that consultation produces a consensus that the schedule 12 terms are not of the contemplated arm’s length quality, they will be modified. 
     
      
    66    In the end, clause 15.6, coupled with schedule 12, cannot be seen as ensuring or requiring the appointment of LMIA as manager. Its true effect is to require SOL and its two co-parties to select and contract with a suitable party once the consultation required by the clause has been completed. That party need not be LMIA. 
     
      
       
      The condition precedent was not satisfied 
       
      
    67    I return now to the central question whether, in the events which happened, it can properly be said that either of the bids submitted by DSC “was successful”. I have concluded that neither such bid was successful. This is so because of two important departures which caused the arrangements eventually reflected in the Stadium Development Agreement to differ in a material way from the arrangements proposed in the bids. 
     
      
    68    The first such departure is in relation to funding and financial structure. It is summed up in the following statement of Mr Wise in cross-examination: 
     
      
       
        
        “But the heads of agreement was for a bid placed on 27 or 30 June, which was $150 million short of underwriting and required the Victorian Government to provide that. The bid on 1 September was fully and absolutely underwritten by private equity. The bid had changed.” 
        
       
       
      The change involved the introduction of new parties committed to providing the finance that original consortium members would not or could not provide. The balance of influence within the bidding group shifted to the equity providers. 
       
      
    69    The second departure - of more immediate relevance, in the present context – was in relation to management of the stadium. The bids of June proposed LMIA as manager. The arrangements embodied in the Stadium Development Agreement did not adopt that proposal and left the choice of manager for future decision. The feature of the bids involving appointment of LMIA as manager thus did not find a place in the concluded arrangement arising from those bids. 
     
      
    70    Related companies of DSC were “successful” in becoming two of the three companies which together became “the Developer” under the Stadium Management Agreement. That “successful” outcome would not have been achieved but for DSC’s having submitted its two bids to the Authority. But neither of those bids was “successful” because neither was in substance translated from proposal to contract. Intervening events and negotiations brought about substantial differences and departures in relation to parties, in relation to funding and financing and in relation to management and identity of the manager. 
     
      
    71    It follows from this that the condition to be satisfied before DSC was obliged by the heads of agreement to bring about the appointment of LMIA as manager of the stadium on the basis stated in the heads of agreement was never satisfied. It also follows that, according to the correct construction of the heads of agreement, no breach of its express terms occurred through non-appointment of LMIA as such manager. In saying this, I do not resort to any strict or literal approach at the expense of an approach consonant with business reality. Mr Sullivan QC, senior counsel for the plaintiffs, pointed to recent emphasis in the High Court in Pan Foods Company Importers & Distributors Pty Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (2000) 74 ALJR 791 and McCann v Switzerland Insurance Australia Ltd (2000) 75 ALJR 325 on the need for a commercial approach to commercial contracts. In the former case, Callinan J said:  
     
      
       
        
         “In my view, such documents should be construed practically, so as to give effect to their presumed purposes and so as not to defeat the achievement of such purposes by an excessively narrow and artificially constricted construction.” 
        
       
      
    72    I do not consider that the approach I have taken to the pre-condition “If any of the Bids are successful” runs counter to this. On the contrary, once it is recognised that the contractual promise to appoint LMIA was given and, more importantly, received in circumstances where the process about to be embarked upon was a process of negotiation which might see DSC obliged, in its own interests, to depart significantly from its own original desires in order to obtain the ultimate benefit for itself (or, as eventually happened here, for another member of the corporate group to which it belonged), the practical business construction becomes one which must accommodate the possibility that an element of the proposal unacceptable to the Authority will be jettisoned in the course of that negotiation. The negotiation process was one in which it was clear from the outset that the Authority placed great weight on the qualities of the proposed manager and would play an active role in accepting or rejecting the party put forward as intended manager by a bidder. The Authority simply did not accept LMIA. 
     
      
       
      The plaintiffs’ implied terms case 
       
      
    73    The plaintiffs contend that there were two relevant implied terms in the heads of agreement. They are a term that the parties to the heads of agreement would act in good faith in the performance of their contractual rights and obligations pursuant thereto and a term that each party would do all things necessary on its part to enable the other party to have the benefit of its contractual rights. The plaintiffs also say that DSC accordingly had an obligation to do everything reasonably open to it to have LMIA appointed manager of the stadium. 
     
      
    74    As the recent decision of the Court of Appeal in Burger King Corporation v Hungry Jack’s Pty Ltd [2001] NSWCA 187 shows, there is good reason to think that there are to be found in virtually every commercial contract terms of good faith and reasonableness implied by law. The content of such terms is, in a general sense, that the party bound by them, although free to promote his, her or its own interests, must act fairly and reasonably in all the circumstances. Furthermore and as the High Court has recently reaffirmed in Peters (WA) Ltd v Petersville Ltd [2001] HCA 45 referring to Secured Income Real Estate (Aust) Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Ltd (1979) 144 CLR 596 and Shepherd v Felt & Textiles of Australia Ltd (1931) 45 CLR 359, the law already implies an obligation by a party contracting to confer a benefit to do all such things as are necessary on its part to enable its counterparty to have that benefit, at the same time desisting from conduct which hinders or prevents the fulfilment of the purpose of the express promise made. 
     
      
    75    It is important to recall, however, that the implied terms mentioned are, of their nature, incapable of rising above express terms. In Burger King, the Court of Appeal quoted the following passage from Metropolitan Life Insurance Co v RJR Nabisco Inc 716 F. Supp. 1504 (1989): 
     
      
       
        
        “In other words, the implied covenant will only aid and further the explicit terms of the agreement and will never impose an obligation ‘which would be inconsistent with other terms of the contractual relationship’. … Viewed another way, the implied covenant of good faith is breached only when one party seeks to prevent the contract’s performance or to withhold its benefits. … As a result, it thus ensures that parties to a contract perform the substantive, bargained-for terms of their agreement.” 
        
       
      
    76    The substantive, bargained for terms in the present case were that DSC would cause LMIA to be appointed manager if, as a result of the process of negotiation with the Authority envisaged by the bid parameters, there emerged a contract with the Authority embracing and accepting the management arrangements put forward in DSC’s bids. No such contract emerged, with the result that there was no occasion for implied terms of the kind under discussion to come to the aid of the substantive, bargained for terms. Nor, I might say, do I consider that any implied term required DSC to risk its own interests by insisting in negotiations upon retention of the bid feature involving appointment of LMIA as manager. Once it encountered substantial resistance from the Authority, DSC was free to modify its proposal to overcome the problem. 
     
      
    77    This last point is, I think, borne out by clause 15 of the heads of agreement: 
     
      
       
        
        “Neither party shall have any claim against the other if a Bid is not lodged or if none of the Bids lodged is successful or if one of the Bids lodged rather than any other is selected.” 
        
       
       
      If, as this provision shows, DSC was free to change its mind about lodging a bid at all, it could scarcely be contended that, having lodged its bids, it was compelled to pursue them in unamended form, however hopeless the prospects of achieving a positive outcome in that form might be. 
       
       
      Inducing breach of contract 
       
      
    78    These findings with respect to alleged breach of express and implied terms of the heads of agreement make it unnecessary to pursue the question whether Baulderstone and International induced and procured DSC to commit a breach of contract as against LMIA by failing to appoint LMIA as manager of the stadium. But in light of the possibility that my decision on the breach of contract question may be reviewed on appeal, I shall deal briefly with the inducement issue. I shall do so on the assumption that, contrary to my findings above, DSC was, in the circumstances existing after the execution of the Stadium Development Agreement by the parties thereto, under a contractual duty to ensure that those of them designated “Developer” appointed LMIA as manager of the stadium on the terms in the heads of agreement. I shall also assume that it was within the power of DSC to bring about such a result. 
     
      
    79    The plaintiffs do not seek to hold Baulderstone and International, as employers, vicariously responsible for the actions of employees who, as directors of DSC, caused that company to fail to procure the appointment of LMIA as stadium manager. As the Court of Appeal noted in Australian Development Corporation Pty Ltd v White Constructions Ltd [2001] NSWCA 9, any such attempt would fail on a twofold basis. First, directors of a company do not commit the tort of inducing breach of contract when, acting as directors, they cause their company to commit a breach. So much is established by Said v Butt [1920] 3 KB 497 and, authoritatively for present purposes, by O’Brien v Dawson (1941) 41 SR (NSW) 295 and, on appeal, (1942) 66 CLR 18. Recent examples of the application of the principle in this Division may be found in Tsaprazis v Goldcrest Properties Pty Ltd (2000) 18 ACLC 285 and Idoport Pty Ltd v National Australia Bank Ltd [2001] NSWSC 328. Secondly, a director installed as such on the board of another company by his or her employer is in general presumed not to be subject to the employer’s direction when performing functions as a director, so that no vicarious liability attaches to the employer for the employee’s conduct in that capacity: Kuwait Asia Bank EC v National Mutual Life Nominees Ltd [1991] 1 AC 187; Dairy Containers Ltd v Auditor-General [1995] 2 NZLR 30; New Zealand Guardian Trust Co Ltd v Brooks [1995] 1 WLR 96. On a different front, while the plaintiffs did seek to place some reliance upon the decision of the Court of Appeal in CSR Ltd v Wren (1998) 44 NSWLR 463, it is clear to me that the evidence in this case would not support a finding that the holding company of DSC had assumed direct responsibility to persons having relationships with the subsidiary so as to bring it within the principle involved in that case, even if that principle could somehow be extended beyond responsibility by way of a duty of care in negligence. 
     
      
    80    The plaintiffs’ case of inducing breach of contract is founded on the general proposition that, as it was put by Mr Sullivan QC in his written outline of submissions in chief, “at all times relevant to the proceedings, SOL, DSC, Baulderstone Hornibrook, Baulderstone Hornibrook International and A W Baulderstone Holdings Pty Ltd had a common corporate mind”. The need for that submission (or for some other means of attributing to Baulderstone and International knowledge possessed by DSC or natural persons making relevant decisions for DSC) arises from the central importance, in a case of inducement to breach contract, of the state of knowledge of the alleged tortfeasor emphasised in the following passage in the judgment of Isaacs J in Short v City Bank of Sydney (1912) 15 CLR 148:  
     
      
       
        
        “[T]he defendant must have induced or procured the doing of what he knew would be a breach of contract. A bona fide belief reasonably entertained that it was not a breach of contract would be fatal to the claim. If the defendant did not know of the existence of the contract, he could not induce its breach; if he reasonably believed it did not require a certain act to be performed, his inducing a party to the contract to do something inconsistent with it could not be regarded as an inducement or procurement knowingly to break the contract; if he believed on reasonable grounds that the contract had been rescinded, or performance waived, when in fact it had not, he could not be said to knowingly procure its breach.” 
        
       
      
    81    The position was summarised by the Court of Appeal in Fightvision Pty Ltd v Onisforou (1999) 47 NSWLR 473 in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “In summary, the defendant must know of the contract and sufficient of its terms to know that what the defendant induced or procured the party to the contract to do would be in breach of the contract. If the defendant knew of the existence of the contract but believed reasonably that what the defendant induced or procured the party to do was not a breach, or reasonably believed that the contract had been rescinded or performance waived, the defendant had not knowingly induced or procured the breach.” 
        
       
      
    82    The directors of DSC at the material times were Mr Dempsey, Mr Forde and Mr Pritchard. Those three persons also constituted the total board of SOL and were three of the five directors making up the board of Baulderstone. Two of them – Mr Forde and Mr Pritchard – were the total board of International. All were, with others, directors of A.W. Baulderstone Holdings Pty Limited. It is in this factual context that the submission of “common corporate mind” was advanced. No evidence was given by any of these directors. There was little evidence of their acts. It was shown, however, that Mr Dempsey, as a director of DSC, sent to Mr Tabart a letter dated 30 June 1997 on DSC letterhead which, from its date and terms, may readily be inferred to have accompanied the DSC bids lodged on that date. Mr Pritchard, as chief executive of Baulderstone, sent a similar letter of the same date to Mr Tabart in relation to which I draw the same inference. A letter of 21 August 1997 (prepared on DSC letterhead, signed by Mr Dempsey and addressed to Mr Tabart) accompanied “our revised offer both on a preferred and conforming basis”.  
     
      
    83    For the inducement to breach contract case to succeed on the strength of the “common corporate mind” submission, it seems to me that two propositions must be made out: first, that the corporate entities against which the allegation is levelled (being Baulderstone and International) possessed the degree of knowledge about the heads of agreement and their content made necessary by the above extracts from Short v City Bank of Sydney and Fightvision v Onisforou; and, second, that those corporate entities applied direct persuasion or procurement or inducement to DSC with the intention of bringing about breach by it of its contract. I note here that there is no claim that Baulderstone and International indirectly procured breach by DSC by, as it were, causing DSC to be replaced by SOL and the other two companies constituting “the Developer”. As pleaded, the claim is that they induced and procured DSC to agree to SOL being permitted to take the benefit of its rights pursuant to the contract to construct and manage the stadium, thereby inducing and procuring DSC to breach the heads of agreement. 
     
      
    84    So far as the knowledge of Baulderstone and International is concerned, it can be said at once that neither company automatically possesses the knowledge of each of its directors. At the same time, however, a director’s knowledge may become the subject of positive duties owed by the director to the company. One such duty arises when a director is in possession of knowledge that a course of action the company has in contemplation may, unbeknowns to the other directors and officers, expose the company to the prospect of harm. A director in that position incurs at least a duty to ensure that the danger of which he or she alone is aware is pointed out to relevant corporate decision makers: Permanent Building Society v Wheeler (1994) 11 WAR 187; South Australia v Clark (1996) 66 SASR 199; Fitzsimmons v R (1997) 23 ACSR 355. 
     
      
    85    Another species of duty to which a director may become subject in respect of his knowledge is a duty actually to communicate that knowledge to the company. Such a duty, as well as a qualification upon it, was stated by Young J (as his Honour then was) in Harkness v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (1993) 32 NSWLR 543: 
     
      
       
        
        “While ordinarily there will be a duty to communicate knowledge received, where the director is functioning within another corporate organisation and information comes to the director in the course of that work with the other organisation, his duty of confidentiality to that other organisation will subsume any duty he might otherwise owe to the company which appointed him to that organisation.” 
        
       
      
    86    An unqualified duty to communicate information to another person will generally be presumed to be duly discharged, with the result that knowledge of the information is regarded as attributed to that other person. Although it involved a duty arising in a somewhat different way, the following passage in the judgment of Buckley LJ in Belmont Finance Corporation Ltd v Williams Furniture Ltd (No 2) [1980] 1 All ER 393 makes this clear: 
     
      
       
        
        “Their knowledge must, in my opinion, be imputed to the companies of which they were directors and secretary, for an officer of a company must surely be under a duty, if he is aware that a transaction into which his company is about to enter is illegal or tainted with illegality, to inform the board of that company of the fact. Where an officer is under a duty to make such a disclosure to his company, his knowledge is imputed to the company ( 
        Re David Payne & Co Ltd 
         [1904] 2 Ch 608;  
        Re Fenwick, Stobart & Co Ltd 
         [1902] 1 Ch 507).” 
        
       
      
    87    Reference may also be made to the discussion of these matters by von Doussa J in Beach Petroleum NL v Johnson (1993) 43 FCR 1 and to the following observation of Vaughan Williams J in Re Hampshire Land Company [1896] 2 Ch 743 approved by the House of Lords in J.C. Houghton & Co v Nothard Lowe & Wills Ltd [1928] AC 1: 
     
      
       
        
        “Knowledge which has been acquired by the officer of one company will not be imputed to the other company, unless the common officer had some duty imposed on him to communicate that knowledge to the other company, and had some duty imposed on him by the company which is alleged to be affected by the notice, to receive the notice.” 
        
       
      
    88    The principle is of more general application in the field of principal and agent, as is shown by the following observation of Mason J in Sargent v ASL Developments Ltd (1974) 131 CLR 634 concerning information received by a solicitor acting for clients on the purchase of land: 
     
      
       
        
        “Consequently, as the information as to zoning which Mr Sweeting acquired was within the ambit of his authority from the Turnbulls and as he was under a duty to communicate it to the Turnbulls once he had received it, his knowledge is to be imputed to them.” 
        
       
      
    89    How did the duty to communicate described by Young J in Harkness v Commonwealth Bank (above) in relation to what might be termed an “installed” director operate in this case? Context is, of course, critical. The present context is the familiar one of a group of companies in which a holding company is, in a legal or beneficial sense or both, the sole owner of all shares in a number of subsidiaries, some of which are likewise the sole owners of all shares in yet further companies. It must be recognised, of course, that each company in such a group is a separate entity and may have interests distinct from those of other group members or the group as a whole: Walker v Wimborne (1975) 137 CLR 1; Industrial Equity Ltd v Blackburn (1977) 137 CLR 567. Equally, however, there can be no doubt that the ultimate holding company has a clear power to control the conduct of each subsidiary, even to the extent of altering the subsidiary’s constitution to allocate to the members in general meeting (effectively, the immediate holding company by which all shares are owned) key decision making powers commonly entrusted to directors and to prohibit the directors doing certain things for the company. This is the effect of the well-known statement of Greer LJ in John Shaw & Sons (Salford) Ltd v Shaw [1935] 2 KB 113 concerning the interaction of shareholders with directors. In addition, of course, the ultimate holding company, while not able to require the directors of a wholly owned subsidiary to act in a particular way, may, either directly or by procuring appropriate action by some intermediate holding company, authorise in advance or ratify retrospectively acts of those directors which would otherwise entail breach of duty by them, thus making directors willing to act as the ultimate holding company wishes. This is the principle enunciated in cases such as Hogg v Cramphorn Ltd [1967] Ch 254, Bamford v Bamford [1968] 3 WLR 317, Winthrop Investments Ltd v Winns Ltd [1975] 2 NSWLR 666 and Kinsela v Russell Kinsela Pty Ltd (1986) 4 NSWLR 722. The ultimate holding company can also cause the composition of the board of directors of any wholly owned subsidiary to be changed as and when it wishes. In these ways, behaviour of a wholly owned subsidiary may be strongly influenced and even dictated by its holding company acting not as a negotiating or persuading outsider but as a participant in the subsidiary’s own internal decision making.  
     
      
    90    These realities are even more pronounced when a company is formed as a wholly owned subsidiary in order to undertake a particular activity. Such a situation was examined by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia in Pascoe Ltd v Lucas (1999) 75 SASR 737. That case concerned an allegation that a director of a wholly owned subsidiary had breached his duties to the subsidiary by committing it to an improvident transaction at the behest of the holding company. Lander J, with whom Millhouse and Duggan JJ agreed, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “When a company is incorporated for the sole purpose of entering into a transaction at the behest of its sole shareholder, provided that the company is at the time solvent and provided that the transaction is intra vires and the directors are not acting in bad faith the company cannot later complain about that transaction, provided of course that the directors have made full disclosure of that which is required to obtain the consent of its shareholders. 
        
       
       
        
        It is not necessary that a formal decision of the shareholders should be made; an informal consent will be sufficient:  
        Re Duomatic Ltd 
         [1969] 2 Ch 365. Again it follows that where the corporation has only one shareholder there is even less need for a formal meeting. 
        
       
       
        
        Again provided that the company was solvent when it entered into these transactions and when the authority or ratification was given by the directors a liquidator subsequently appointed to the company is in no better position than the shareholders who authorised or ratified the transaction:  
        Multinational Gas and Petrochemical Co v Multinational Gas and Petrochemical Services Ltd 
          
        per Dillon LJ at 290,  
        A-G 
          
        Canada v Standard Trust Co of New York 
         [1911] AC 498 at 501.” 
        
       
      
    91    This passage emphasises the point that informal action by a sole shareholder can be sufficient to constitute conduct on its part having such constitutional significance within a wholly owned subsidiary as to be a determinant of that subsidiary’s own conduct. There is, to my mind, no difference between such action of a holding company, whether formal or informal, in relation to a wholly owned subsidiary and actions of directors of the subsidiary which likewise shape its conduct as a corporation. Just as directors commonly make for a company the decisions which, as a mere legal construct, it has no mind of its own to make, so too may a holding company which is the sole owner of the shares in the subsidiary be, in a realistic sense, the source of such decisions. 
     
      
    92    In the present case, the actions of DSC were dictated by decisions made within the established management structure of the Australian group of companies constituted by A.W. Baulderstone Holdings Pty Limited and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. I have mentioned that the DSC bids submitted to the Authority on 30 June 1997 were accompanied by covering letters from Mr Dempsey as a director of DSC and Mr Pritchard as chief executive of Baulderstone. Also sent to the Authority on that occasion was a similar letter from Mr Greiner, chairman of A.W. Baulderstone Holdings Pty Limited. It may readily be inferred from these letters that DSC acted in accordance with a plan developed and implemented by A.W. Baulderstone Holdings Pty Limited in conjunction with other wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Baulderstone and International. 
     
      
    93    I am satisfied that, having regard to the circumstances in which they occupied their offices, each of the directors of DSC was under a duty of the kind described by Young J in Harkness v Commonwealth Bank and that no obligation of confidentiality owed to DSC itself intervened to preclude the presumption that that duty was duly discharged. All knowledge and information possessed by each DSC director by virtue of his directorship of DSC was therefore attributed to each other company in the wholly-owned A.W. Baulderstone Holdings group of which he was a director. All such knowledge and information possessed by any director of DSC must therefore be regarded as having been within the possession of both Baulderstone and International at the relevant times. On that footing, each of those companies must be taken to have had knowledge of the existence and content of the heads of agreement. Any other conclusion would disregard the realities of the wholly-owned group structure. 
     
      
    94    Once that point is reached and it is accepted that Baulderstone and International, the alleged tortfeasors, possessed the degree of knowledge about the heads of agreement and their content made necessary by the quoted extracts from Short v City Bank of Sydney and Fightvision v Onisforou, it must be decided whether Baulderstone and International applied direct persuasion or procurement or inducement to DSC with the intention of bringing about breach by it of its contract. 
     
      
    95    It may readily be accepted that any failure by DSC to act as required by the heads of agreement was produced, in an immediate sense, by failure of its directors and officers to cause it to do so, coupled with failure of its immediate and ultimate holding companies to exercise their undoubted power to avoid or remedy the deficiency. That dual failure no doubt resulted from a decision made by one or more natural persons. The evidence shows that, in a practical sense, the chief decision-maker was Mr Wise. It is he who had, within the A.W. Baulderstone Holdings group, the main responsibility for progressing the bids and looking after the group’s interests in relation to the stadium project. The decision to introduce SOL and to adopt the revised structure in which the developer was to be SOL together with the trustee and manager of a unit trust, thereby displacing DSC, was Mr Wise’s decision. But it was a decision he made within a framework of authority which must have been created by or through the board of directors of the ultimate holding company, A.W. Baulderstone Holdings Pty Limited. That framework of authority may be taken to have applied throughout the group of wholly-owned subsidiaries, including DSC, SOL, Baulderstone and International. 
     
      
    96    In such circumstances, there is a distinct air of unreality about the proposition that one wholly-owned subsidiary within and subject to the framework of authority acts intentionally to cause another wholly-owned subsidiary within and subject to the same framework of authority to behave in a certain way when both are actuated by and subject to the common authority. 
     
      
    97    The notion that directors of a company are not guilty of the tort of inducing breach of contract when, duly acting as directors, they commit their company to a course involving such breach was explained by Jordan CJ in O’Brien v Dawson (above) in this way: 
     
      
       
        
        “The next question is whether, if an ordinary limited liability company is a party to a contract, and its directors acting as such, and in the course of conducting the company’s business at a Board meeting, resolve that the company shall refuse to perform a contract to which it is a party, the directors knowing that the refusal cannot be legally justified, and effect is given to this resolution, the directors concerned are guilty of the tort – and presumably also of the crime – of conspiracy. I am of opinion that in such a case it is entirely artificial to speak of the directors as ‘procuring’ the company to break its contract in the sense in which this word is used in the  
        Lumley v Gye 
         type of case. An incorporated company is a figment of the law. It is incapable of acting except through agents. Its directors are persons who have been authorised by the constituent members of the corporation to cause acts to be done on its behalf. They are its agents who have power to control its acts. It cannot act at all except through them or through some other authorised agents. They are not in the position of outsiders who are influencing the independent volition of a contracting party who is capable of exercising volition for himself. It is their volition and theirs only which determines the making, the performance or the breach of the company’s contract. In my opinion on the state of facts assumed, they stand in the same position as regards liability to a charge of conspiracy as do joint contractors. This is not to say that every boardroom constitutes an Alsatia in which persons may conspire to their heart’s content and with complete impunity so long as they do so in the character of directors of a company and employ the machinery of their company for carrying their conspiracy into effect. It means only that the mere fact that the directors who determine whether or not a company shall perform the obligations of a contract are several in number makes them no more subject to the law of conspiracy than would be a single managing director if it were he who determined it …… Directors of a company are, however, personally responsible for any torts committed by their company in the procuring of which they are personally implicated … But there is authority for the proposition that the fact that one or more directors of a company acting as such, are the instruments by which the company, without just cause, refuses to perform a contract does not confer on the other party to the contract a right to sue directors in tort on the footing that they have procured a breach of contractual rights …..” 
        
       
      
    98    Central to this notion is recognition that the directors of a corporate contracting party are not in the position of outsiders influencing the independent volition of a contracting party capable of exercising volition for himself; and that it is the directors’ volition which determines the making, the performance or the breach of the company’s contract. The directors’ volition is thus the company’s volition. Within the confines of a group of companies where a holding company such as A.W. Baulderstone Holdings Pty Limited possesses, in relation to each of several wholly-owned subsidiaries, full and sole capacity to control the content of the corporate constitution (even to the extent of allocating to itself powers otherwise exercisable by the directors), to relieve the directors of the consequences of breach of duty by advance authorisation or retrospective ratification and to change at will the composition of the board of directors, it seems to me to be the case that the holding company, like the subsidiary’s directors, is not in the position of an outsider influencing the independent volition of the subsidiary. In such a situation, it is the holding company’s volition which, sometimes formally by exercise of legal powers but often informally in the way mentioned in Pascoe Ltd v Lucas (above), determines the making, the performance or the breach of the subsidiary’s contract. The holding company does not engage in what Herring CJ described in Rutherford v Poole [1953] VLR 130 as “actionable intervention”. There is really no “intervention” at all. The subsidiary makes the relevant decision but that decision proceeds from an exercise of the holding company’s will within and through the subsidiary, rather than upon it. 
     
      
    99    If breach of the heads of agreement by DSC were established, I would therefore conclude that neither Baulderstone nor International induced or procured the breach in such a way as to be actionable on the basis pleaded. 
     
      
       
      The claim for reimbursement of expenses 
       
      
    100    The question posed in this part of the plaintiffs’ case is whether Baulderstone or DSC or either of them is liable to reimburse LMI and LMIA or either of them for expenses incurred in the pre-award stage of the bid process. Several alternative bases of claim are advanced. As I understood the position the plaintiffs eventually took, there are four such bases: first, the heads of agreement; second, an alleged oral agreement made on 19 March 1997 by Mr McGee on behalf of LMI and Mr Wise on behalf of Baulderstone; third, an estoppel as against Baulderstone; and, fourth, restitutionary principles. I shall deal with these in turn. 
     
      
       
      Reimbursement under heads of agreement 
       
      
    101    The only potentially relevant provision of the heads of agreement is clause 8: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Developer shall reimburse to LMI such expenses that have been incurred by LMI prior to the date the appointment takes effect as are agreed with the Developer.” 
        
       
      
    102    “LMI” here is LMIA and “the Developer” is DSC. So much is made clear by the descriptions of the parties at the start of the heads of agreement.  
     
      
    103    Clause 8 assumes that it will be possible to identify “the date of the appointment”. The “appointment” referred to is, clearly enough, the appointment of LMIA as stadium manager in fulfilment of the heads of agreement. That, of course, never happened. Mr Campbell QC submitted that clause 8 could therefore not operate at all, but I do not think that can be right. It really means, I think, that all expenses which LMIA incurred in connection with the bid process involving it are within the contemplation of the clause. 
     
      
    104    The “such … as” aspect of the clause means that the reimbursement obligation extends only to those of the expenses described (that is, those incurred by LMIA in connection with the bid process) which “are agreed with” DSC. It follows that, unless and until particular expenses have been shown to have been incurred by LMIA in the particular context and to have been “agreed with” DSC, no reimbursement obligation arises. But DSC does not have an uncontrolled ability to agree or not according to its own selfish wishes or some whim. The law readily implies a requirement in this kind of context that the party whose decision is material to the operation of the provision act honestly and reasonably: see, for example, Meehan v Jones (1982) 147 CLR 571 per Mason J. The real effect of clause 8 is therefore that DSC agreed to reimburse to LMIA those expenses incurred by LMIA in connection with the bid process for which DSC, acting reasonably and honestly, ought to accept responsibility. 
     
      
    105    To my mind, the implied qualification as to honesty and reasonableness has two facets in the particular context. First, a particular item of expense must be seen to have a rational and substantial connection with the bid process in the sense of having been properly incurred for the purposes of the process. Secondly, the quantum must be seen not to be, in the context, unwarranted or extravagant.  
     
      
    106    One obvious point about clause 8 is that it does not extend to expenses incurred by LMI, as distinct from LMIA. This is a significant limiting factor, given that LMIA came into existence as an LMI/ISFM joint venture company several months after the time that its two shareholders had begun to work on the project. The conclusion that clause 8 is the source of a right of reimbursement on the part of LMIA therefore cannot be regarded as disposing of the reimbursement claim in its entirety. 
     
      
       
      Reimbursement under oral agreement 
       
      
    107    The plaintiffs’ summons pleads an oral agreement made on 19 March 1997 between Mr McGee on behalf of LMI and Mr Wise of Baulderstone, the terms of which included: 
     
      
      (a) that “in the event that the Baulderstone Hornibrook bid was successful”: 
      
    (i) LMI would be appointed manager of the stadium for the pre-opening period and for 25 years after the stadium opening; and 
     
      
       
        
        (ii) LMI’s expenses in relation to the bid process would be repaid; and 
        
       
      (b) if the bid was unsuccessful, LMI’s expenses incurred in the bid process would not be paid. 
       
      
    108    The quoted words above (“in the event that the Baulderstone Hornibrook bid was successful”) appear in the plaintiff’s summons but are not further elaborated there. It is clear, however, that the concepts of a bid and its success said to have been employed in an oral agreement made on 19 March 1997 do not necessarily correspond with similarly phrased concepts used in a document entered into more than three months later between different, although allied, parties. I refer, of course, to the heads of agreement and to the particular aspect of them concerning success of “any of the Bids” already examined in some detail. 
     
      
    109    There is, however, a threshold problem in relation to the case based on the alleged oral agreement – namely, some fairly fundamental discrepancy in the testimony of those said to have been parties to the conversations in which the contract was formed. That being so, it is preferable to pass on to the plaintiffs’ alternative formulations of their claim for reimbursement. 
     
      
       
      Reimbursement based on estoppel 
       
      
    110    The third basis on which the plaintiffs seek reimbursement of expenses is an estoppel against Baulderstone. The basis of the estoppel is, they say, confirmed by the following evidence given by Mr Wise: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. From the time the Heads of Agreement were executed onwards, did you work on the basis on behalf of the consortium that the reasonable expenses of LMI, which had been incurred from the time that they came on board in the project in February onwards, would be paid under the heads of Agreement? 
         
        A. Reasonable expenses agreed, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        …. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. From the time the Heads of Agreement were signed you – when I say ‘you’ I mean through you and DSC – worked upon the basis that the reasonable expenses incurred since the LMI parties became involved in the bid were to be paid in accordance with the terms of that Heads of Agreement? 
         
        A. Reasonable expenses as agreed, yes.” 
        
       
      
    111    The references here to “the LMI parties” are, in the context of the cross-examination as a whole, references to both LMI and LMIA. Mr Wise’s evidence makes it clear that Baulderstone (the party he was seen as representing) had led both LMI and LMIA to expect that, quite apart from the heads of agreement (or, rather, as a supplement to or interpretation of it), reasonable expenses of both LMI and LMIA in connection with the bid orchestrated by Baulderstone would be met by Baulderstone. That Mr Wise himself proceeded on that footing is borne out by his subsequent evidence that he had actually recommended that Baulderstone pay certain LMI expenses. The evidence also shows that Mr McGee and Mr Watson both acted on the same footing as Mr Wise in this respect, having made it clear to Baulderstone that LMI was a fee for service organisation not an entrepreneur (a position also underlined at various stages of the relationship by LMI’s continuing and firm refusal to consider adopting the role of an equity investor in the project). There was thus a common assumption which formed the conventional basis of the relationship between the two LMI parties (i.e, LMI and, later, LMIA) and Baulderstone as the co-ordinator of the bid project. That assumption is sufficient to found an estoppel on the basis discussed by the High Court in Con-Stan Industries Pty Ltd v Norwich Winterthur Insurance (Australia) Ltd (1986) 160 CLR 226 at 244. 
     
      
    112    I am satisfied that Baulderstone is estopped from denying an obligation on its part to reimburse both LMI and LMIA for expenses actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the bid process. 
     
      
    113    The conclusions with respect to the heads of agreement and estoppel are sufficient to justify the plaintiffs’ claims that their reasonable expenses incurred in relation to the bid process should be reimbursed by Baulderstone and there is no need to consider the further claim in restitution based on unjust enrichment – said by Lord Steyn in Banque Financiere de la Cite v Parc (Battersea) Ltd [1999] 1 AC 221 to rank in England today “next to contract and tort as part of the law of obligations”, but probably not enjoying the same status in this country: see Pavey & Matthews Pty Ltd v Paul (1986) 162 CLR 221. 
     
      
       
      Quantification of the expenses claim 
       
      
    114    Mr McGee wrote to Mr Wise on 20 October 1997 referring to “the Multi-Sports and Events Stadium to be constructed in the Docklands Stadium Precinct” and enclosing “an invoice representing the expenses incurred by Leisure Management through September 30, 1997 regarding this project”. In doing so, Mr McGee referred to the heads of agreement. The invoice, which was actually dated 30 September 1997, contained 36 items under ten headings amounting in all to US$81,902.28. It seems clear that all the expenses listed were represented as having been incurred by LMI, with nothing represented as claimed by LMIA. The reference to the heads of agreement was therefore inappropriate, in a strict sense, but my findings on the estoppel issue support LMI’s claim for that sum, at least to the extent that the expenses concerned may be said to be reasonable. 
     
      
    115    Mr Campbell QC, in the course of cross-examination, asked a number of questions clearly intended to call in question the appropriateness of some of the items in the 30 September 1997 invoice in the context of any claim for reimbursement of expenses reasonably incurred in connection with the project. The thrust of his questions was such as to suggest that some items may not have had a necessary or close link with efforts expended by LMI on the project and that others may have been extravagant. This led on to a submission that certain items were not reasonably incurred – in particular, certain legal fees and air fares for a visit by Mr McGee to Australia in which he dealt with other business matters as well as those pertaining to the stadium bid. 
     
      
    116    Mr Sullivan’s response was twofold: first, that no cogent reason had been expressed as to why the relevant items were not fairly and squarely within the relevant concept, given that they would not have been incurred but for the project; and, second, that there was never any assertion by the Baulderstone Group to this effect in the period of almost four years after the 20 October 1997 claim was submitted until the matter came to court. 
     
      
    117    In my judgment, the plaintiffs have sufficiently made out their quantification case in respect of expenses by reference to the invoice submitted with the letter of 20 October 1997, being expenses incurred by LMI. 
     
      
       
      Conclusions 
       
      
    118    It follows from the findings I have made that the plaintiffs are entitled to order 1 in the Amended Summons, that is, an order that the first and second defendants pay the plaintiffs the sum of US$81,902.28. The plaintiffs are also entitled to interest on that sum at the rate applicable under Schedule J to the Supreme Court Rules until judgment. I shall entertain submissions as to the date from which interest should be computed but, given that 60 days is a reasonable time for the payment of an invoice, I am disposed to think that it should be computed from the day which is 60 days after 20 October 1997. 
     
      
    119    In other respects, the plaintiffs have not made out an entitlement to the relief they seek. 
     
      
    120    I will also hear the parties on costs. The matter will be listed for mention before me at 9.30 am on a day I shall now fix with counsel.

      Friday 12th October 2001 
       
       
       PARRAMATTA CITY COUNCIL V. WATKINS 
        
        
       Judgment 
       
     1 POWELL JA: I agree with the reasons of Hodgson JA as set out below. 
     2 HODGSON JA: On 10th September 1999, Robison DCJ gave judgment for Beverley Watkins against Parramatta City Council in the sum of $131,078.35, as damages for injuries suffered by Ms. Watkins when she fell in South Street, Granville on 29th March 1996. Parramatta City Council has appealed to this Court against the finding that it was liable for damages, but does not challenge the quantum of damages.  
      
       
      CIRCUMSTANCES 
     3 At about 12.00 noon on 29th March 1996 the respondent, who was then 55 years of age, drove her Ford Laser motor vehicle to South Street, Granville with her brother Brian Lawler as a passenger. She parked the vehicle in a designated parking area beside the kerb. She got out of the vehicle, and was walking around the front of it to get to the footpath, when she fell in the vicinity of a manhole cover which was partly protruding from under the vehicle, causing her the injuries in respect of which she claimed.  
     4 The evidence showed that this was a busy area of Granville, with shops in the vicinity. The road was sealed to the kerb with what appeared to be asphalt, there was then a concrete gutter and a sealed footpath. According to evidence accepted by the primary judge and not challenged on appeal: 
      
      (1) The part of the manhole cover nearest the kerb was approximately flush with the road surface, while the part furthest from the kerb was about 50 millimetres below the road surface; and the road surface at the latter region fell steeply to the level of the manhole cover.  
       
      (2) The road surface extended slightly onto the manhole cover in some areas.  
       
      (3) The appellant Council had re-surfaced the road in the early 1990s.  
       
      (4) There was another manhole cover about 40 metres from the one where the respondent fell in a similar position on the road; and although the camber and surfacing of the road was similar at the two places, the slope of the surface down to the manhole cover was much more gradual.  
       
     5 The primary judge noted that there was no evidence as to who installed or owned the manhole or manhole cover. He also noted evidence by the Lord Mayor of the appellant to the effect that, if there were a manhole above or below a road surface, the Council would ask the appropriate authority, be it gas, electricity or water, to remedy the difference by adjusting the manhole so that it became level with the road; and that today the Council carries out regular inspections to pick up deficiencies, but did so less in the early 1990s. 
     6 The primary judge held that the work done by the appellant in the early 1990s clearly created a danger, because the manhole became unsafe by reason of the repair work to the road. He considered that it was reasonably foreseeable that persons using the designated parking area would trip or fall into such a manhole; and that the appellant’s failure to properly carry out the repair or construction of the road surface in the vicinity of the manhole constitute a clear hazard resulting in a foreseeable risk of injury to members of the public such as the respondent. The primary judge held to the effect that the respondent did not see the manhole before she fell, and that her fall was caused by its dangerous state. Accordingly, he held that the appellant’s liability was established. 
      
       
      GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
     7 The Amended Notice of Appeal set out the following grounds: 
      
       
        
        1. The trial judge erred in finding that the Defendant was negligent. 
         
         
        2. The trial judge erred in finding that the Defendant had created a danger, or hazard, in the roadway by resurfacing working at or adjacent to a manhole cover. 
         
         
        3. The trial judge erred in holding that the Defendant owed to the Plaintiff a duty of care. 
         
         
        4. The trial judge erred in holding that the Defendant had breached any duty of care to the Plaintiff. 
        
       
     8 In the light of the High Court decision in Brodie v. Singleton Shire Council (2001) 75 ALJR 992, ground 3 was not pressed.  
      
       
      SUBMISSIONS 
     9 Mr. Garling SC for the appellant submitted that the primary judge was in error in two main respects: firstly, in that the evidence of the mechanism of the respondent’s fall was too vague to enable the cause of it to be determined; and secondly, the evidence did not justify a finding that the appellant was guilty of negligence in relation to the condition of the road and manhole cover at the relevant region.  
     10 On the causation question, Mr. Garling submitted that the respondent’s own evidence concerning the fall went no further than the following: 
      
       
        
        I got out of the car and locked the door. I walked to the front of the car and I turned towards the footpath, I took one step and I fell into the – or I trod onto the side of the manhole and went into it, and then I went down on my knee.  
        
       
     11 Mr. Garling submitted that the respondent did not say why it was she fell. The account only established the approximate location of the fall, and did not even show that the side of the manhole where she trod was the side with the 50 millimetre deep edge or some other part of the side of the manhole. The fall could equally have been from some other feature of the region, or even an object such as a stone that happened to be in the area. Mr. Garling also pointed to what he claimed was the inconsistent allegation made in the Statement of Claim, namely that the respondent tripped.  
     12 Turning to the other main ground, Mr. Garling submitted that there was no evidence that the work done by the appellant in the early 1990s involved grading or excavation or changing the gradient of the road generally or specifically in the vicinity of the manhole; that there was no evidence as to the condition of the manhole area before the work, or even after the work prior to the time of the accident; that there was no evidence concerning road construction standards, or expert evidence in respect of the design and execution of the work; and there was no evidence whether the manhole cover was installed before or after the gradient of the road was determined, or whether the manhole had been constructed originally at its present level, or had subsided to that level.  
     13 In so far as the primary judge relied on the fact that another manhole cover 40 metres away was more nearly flush with the road, there was no evidence that the two manhole covers were seated at the same level as each other or that the sub-soil conditions at the two sites were the same, or that the two manholes were constructed by the same authority or at the same time. The proper inference, Mr. Garling submitted, was that the difference between the circumstances of the two manhole covers lay in the relative level of the manholes rather than the construction of the road. 
     14 Mr. Garling submitted that there was no evidence that the appellant could have made the manhole cover level with the road, or, if technically feasible, what works would have been required to achieve that result. There was no evidence, he submitted, that the appellant was empowered to interfere with the manhole and what may have lain beneath it in order to make the cover level with the road. 
     15 Mr. Garling referred to Brodie, and in particular the discussion in that case of the associated case of Ghantous, notably that of Gleeson CJ at par.6, and Callinan J at pars.340 and 355. He also referred to Maloney v. Commissioner for Railways (NSW) (1978) 52 ALJR 292. 
     16 Mr. Garling submitted that, even if, despite what was said in Ghantous, the Court considered that the condition of the road and the manhole was dangerous, it was not open to find that the appellant was negligent in not constructing the road differently, there being no evidence showing that it could reasonably have constructed the area differently. Even if it were considered that the appellant should have ascertained the authority responsible for the manhole and requested that authority to do something about it, the evidence did not justify a finding that taking that action would have avoided the accident.  
     17 Mr. Garling submitted that this was not a case where the evidentiary onus had shifted to the appellant: the evidence did not even get to the level of showing that a hazard had been created.  
     18 Mr. Bates for the respondent submitted that this case was different from the circumstances discussed in Ghantous, and referred to par.163 of that case in the judgment of Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ. Mr. Bates also referred to Webb v. South Australia (1982) 56 ALJR 912, and David Jones v. Bates [2001] NSWCA 233.  
      
       
      DECISION 
     19 It is my opinion that the primary judge’s finding that the respondent’s fall was caused by the 50 millimetre drop from the road surface to the manhole cover was clearly open and cannot be upset on appeal. In my opinion, the respondent’s description of the occurrence, coupled with her denial in cross-examination that she had “just stepped awkwardly”, and coupled also with the physical state of the road as proved in evidence, amply supports a finding of fact that the respondent’s fall was caused by the abrupt change in level. In the circumstances of this case, the respondent’s evidence of falling after treading on the side of the manhole supports the inference that the respondent’s foot was partially unsupported and to some extent gave way, causing the fall. The circumstance that the allegation in the Statement of Claim was of tripping does not in my opinion detract significantly from this inference, in the light of the primary judge’s assessment of the plaintiff’s credibility as a witness. 
     20 There is more substance in the other ground.  
     21 In my opinion, any liability in the appellant must depend upon what it did or failed to do at around the time of re-surfacing the road in the early 1990s. I do not think it can be suggested, having regard to the descriptions given of the manhole and the photographs, that there had been any subsidence since that work was done; and even if it were the case that the appellant should have had some inspection program, such a program could not have disclosed to the appellant any more than would have been apparent at the time of the works.  
     22 I accept the appellant’s submission that there is no basis for any finding that the appellant should have substantially changed its design for the level and the gradient of the road to conform to another authority’s manhole. I also accept that the evidence does not show that the re-surfacing work increased the danger of the transition from the road surface to the manhole cover. However, the appellant did the re-surfacing work, and left it in the condition described in evidence; and if it is the case that that condition constituted an unreasonable hazard, in respect of which the appellant could and should have taken some action, then the primary judge’s finding can be upheld.  
     23 In my opinion, the evidence about the other manhole does give support to the respondent’s contention that the appellant could have provided for a more gradual and therefore safer transition from the level of the road surface to that of the manhole. In my opinion, the inference is open from the evidence about similarity of the two manholes that they were installed by the same authority in approximately the same position on the road and at approximately the same level, and that the significant difference between them was that the transition from the level of the road surface to the level of the manhole was made much more gradual in the case of the other manhole. That is enough, in my opinion, to meet Mr. Garling’s submission that it was not open to the primary judge to find that the appellant could have done it differently, in the absence of evidence as to what was possible and reasonable having regard to available methods of construction.  
     24 Furthermore, it would have been possible for the appellant to have requested the authority responsible for the manhole to re-locate its level so as to conform to the road surface, such request having some statutory authority under ss.98 and 99 of the Roads Act 1993 and the pre-cursors of those sections. In the absence of evidence from the appellant that it made such a request, it could be inferred that it did not do so.  
     25 The question then is, should the appellant, as a matter of the exercise of reasonable skill, care and use of resources to keep the risk of injury to the public to reasonable levels, have done one or other or both of these things?  
     26 The answer to that question depends partly on the degree of risk involved, and the nature of the measures required to alleviate it. In Ghantous, the High Court stressed that our environment cannot be risk-free, and that pedestrians cannot expect to have provided for them perfectly level and unblemished surfaces to walk on. It is a matter on which minds could reasonably differ whether the change in level in this case was or was not the kind of irregularity that pedestrians should expect and watch out for.  
     27 I am inclined to think that sudden variations in level of this magnitude may generally be expected at the edge of footpaths, at transitions between different paths or surfaces, and even between footpath slabs in the vicinity of trees; and also between paved and unpaved areas of road. However, the same may not be true within the paved surface of an apparently well-maintained road, particularly where the change of level is not obvious; and the circumstance that the change in level in this case was in a designated parking area, where it could be partially obscured by a parked car, would add to the risk. While the matter is not free from doubt, I am not satisfied that the primary judge was wrong to hold that the change in level was an unreasonable hazard in this case.  
     28 The next matter concerns what the appellant could, and perhaps should, have done about it. As mentioned earlier, in my opinion the evidence about the other manhole justifies a conclusion that the appellant could have made the change in level more gradual, so as to make the transition less hazardous. It could also have advised the authority responsible for the manhole; and although that would not necessarily have resulted in that authority giving the situation in this case priority, in my opinion it is reasonable to conclude that something would have been done during the three or more years between the re-surfacing work and the time of the accident. Neither of the measures to which I have referred would appear to be onerous, and the appellant chose to lead no evidence to suggest that they would be.  
     29 In my opinion, the respondent did lead enough evidence to cast an evidentiary onus on the appellant, if the appellant wished to say that the measures required to deal with this hazard were such that it was not a breach of its duty not to have taken such measures.  
     30 For these reasons, I am not satisfied that the primary judge was wrong in deciding that the appellant was negligent and liable for causing the respondent’s injury. Accordingly, in my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed with costs. 
     31 ROLFE AJA: I agree with Hodgson JA.

      JUDGMENT 
       
     1 GROVE J: This is in the first instance an application to extend the time for making an application for leave to appeal against sentence. The matter has been before this court, differently constituted, on a previous occasion. Directions were given concerning the filing of affidavits in regard to that application and this has been done. 
     2 For my part I would be prepared to grant the extension of time and deal with the application on the merits, despite the circumstance that it was sought to be brought before the court very late in the day 
     3 HOWIE J: I agree the matter should be dealt with on its merits. 
     4 GROVE J: I turn therefore to the application for leave to appeal against sentence which was imposed by Rummery DCJ in the Sydney District Court. The applicant was sentenced on 4 February 2000, having appeared before his Honour on several previous occasions. He had been committed for sentence pursuant to s51A of the Justices Act following his pleas of guilty before a Magistrate to charges first that he supplied a prohibited drug, namely, cocaine on three separate occasions contrary to s25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act and secondly, that he supplied the same drug contrary to s25 of that Act. 
     5 His Honour was also asked to take into account an offence of unlawful possession of property, being cash, the amount of $400, alleged to be the proceeds of drug sales. 
     6 The facts of the matter were that police were conducting an operation pursuant to the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operation) Act 1997 on 17 February 1999. An undercover police operative was introduced to the applicant in the Kings Cross area and following conversation the applicant supplied him with two capsules of cocaine for the sum of $60 each. Earlier on the same day the applicant had been observed to supply a capsule to another unidentified male in exchange for $60. On the following day there was another meeting and again the supply of a capsule for $60 to the undercover operative. 
     7 On 10 March 1999 there followed a similar event and ultimately police approached the applicant on 19 March when he was in a motor vehicle, a search of which located thirty-nine coloured balloons each containing a gelatine capsule. The applicant was conveyed to a police station. In the early hours of the following morning his residence was searched. Therein was obtained the sum of $400, which I have mentioned, and also an amount of 6.09 grams of cocaine which was the subject of the second charge. 
     8 The applicant himself has a drug habit. He informed the police, and it was generally accepted, that he was acquiring the capsules for $40 each and selling them for $60 each thereby making a profit of some $20 in respect of each of the sales. 
     9 In respect of the offences, his Honour on the first charge committed for sentence, imposed in the terms of the then operative Sentencing Act 1989 a minimum term of two years and nine months commencing on 19 March 1999 and an additional term of one year and six months commencing after the expiry of the minimum term on 18 December 2001. On the second charge the applicant was sentenced to twelve months imprisonment concurrent with the initial portion of the minimum term imposed on the first charge. It can be seen, therefore, that the applicant's parole eligibility date is 18 December 2001. 
     10 The applicant was entitled to have taken into account certain matters which it is not necessary presently to elaborate, which were contained in a letter of comfort and in respect of which his Honour expressed himself as granting to the applicant a discount along the lines of the well known cases of Regina v Cartwright 1989 17 NSWLR 243 and Regina v Gallagher 1991 23 NSWLR 220. It might also be mentioned that his Honour expressly said he was granting the applicant a discount by reason of matters pertinent to the authority of Regina v Ellis 1986 6 NSWLR 603. For my part I am unable to identify any matter which would be pertinent to that authority, which deals with charges brought against an offender of which law enforcement authorities would have had no knowledge but for confession and voluntary information. It is possible that his Honour intended to make reference to some other case. In any event, whatever his Honour intended to refer to, it was clearly taken into account in favour of the applicant and could scarcely be a matter of complaint before this court. 
     11 On behalf of the applicant a number of matters were advanced by counsel. The first and primary argument, as I understand it, was based upon a remark made by his Honour in relation to discounts that he intended to apply. When referring to the first offence he said this: 
      
       
        
         
         ""With respect to the first mentioned offence, I take into account the matter on Form 1. I discount the minimum term I would otherwise impose from four years to two years and nine months."" 
         
        
       
     12 His Honour then proceeded to sentence. It is undoubtedly an erroneous approach to discount a sentence by reason of entitlement of an offender only in relation to a minimum term and not in relation to the whole sentence. It was accordingly submitted on behalf of the applicant that the discount should have been applied to the total sentence. In a written submission counsel for the Crown made these observations to the court in relation to what his Honour had said and that I have recited: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Whilst those words may suggest, at first glance, that his Honour discounted only the minimum term and did not apply any discount to the overall term of the sentence, careful consideration shows that a discount must also have been applied to the additional term. This is because the total term of the sentence was four years and three months. If the minimum term before discount was, as his Honour said, four years, it is inconceivable that the additional term was only three months, particularly in light of the finding that had already been made of special circumstances."" 
         
        
       
     13 In my view that observation by the Crown is correct and I would endorse it. I am unpersuaded that his Honour has made the error attributed to him. Obviously his remark is unfortunate in that it was capable of being suggestive of error, but as the Crown has submitted, upon analysis it cannot be concluded that error in fact occurred. 
     14 The next matter advanced on behalf of the applicant was that the sentence was manifestly excessive. We were referred to some tables of sentences available from the statistics collated by the Judicial Commission. Those statistics related to offences contrary to s 25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, a relatively recent legislative initiative. There is not a great source of material in order to establish sentencing patterns. More importantly, in my view those statistics completely ignore the circumstance that the applicant needed to be sentenced also for the not insignificant offence arising out of his possession of 6.09 grams of cocaine in his residence. That quantity is, as has been observed, more than twice the specified traffickable quantity. In my view, the contention that the sentence was manifestly excessive is not made out. 
     15 Finally, it was submitted on behalf of the applicant that his Honour erred in failing to give the applicant sufficient credit for his early plea of guilty. This sentencing exercise took place before the publication of the judgment of this court in Regina v. Thomson 2000 49 NSWLR 383. Nevertheless, at common law it was incumbent upon his Honour to acknowledge matters such as the plea of guilty. This he did in his opening remarks. The committal of offenders for sentence to the District Court is a daily occurrence which would be encountered frequently by every Judge of the District Court and I am entirely unpersuaded that his Honour in any way overlooked the circumstance. His assessment of sentence does not reveal in its quantification that there is any lack of sufficient credit for the early plea of guilty. On the contrary, given the whole of the applicant's circumstances which it is not necessary to detail, it seems to me that the sentence imposed represented a sound exercise of his Honour's discretion.  
     16 I am therefore of the view that the orders should be made as I have indicated extending time. I would, however, grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. 
     17 HOWIE J: Yes, I agree. 
     18 GROVE J: The orders therefore will be as I have proposed.

      REGINA v BRIAN PERCIVAL 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
     1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentence imposed upon the applicant by his Honour Judge Goldring. 
     2 The applicant was presented for trial in the Cootamundra District Court on a number of counts alleging sexual intercourse with two juvenile complainants. At the time of the alleged offences the victims were aged in one case about 12-14, and in the other, about a year younger. The victims were in fact cousins and they were each, although in a different structure, nieces of the applicant. After one of the complainants had given her evidence-in-chief and the trial proceeded thus far, the applicant sought to be re-arraigned and pleaded guilty to one count in respect of each of the victims. The Crown elected not to proceed upon the other counts and the pleas of guilty were taken as representative of the conduct charged against the applicant. On the matter of sentence, the learned judge was asked to take into account on a Form 1 two further matters charging aggravated indecent assault. In this case the victim was a third girl aged, at the time of the offences, 11 years. It is not necessary to elaborate the details of the offences beyond saying that the applicant had employment as a car detailer. He persuaded the victims to come and assist him in his work for payment. In that sense, as his Honour observed, he was the employer of the girls. It appears that he made small payments to them but on occasions where they gratified his sexual impulses, it was not unusual for him to pay them larger amounts. Certain matters were drawn to the attention of the girls which he threatened would occur in the event that they revealed his conduct which, in general, was to persuade the firstmentioned children to fellate him.  
     3 So far as the Form 1 matters are concerned, they were not as serious, although the child was even younger. In this case, again the girl had been persuaded to assist in employment. The applicant commenced his predatory behaviour by enquiring as to whether she had a boyfriend, and later whether or not she permitted him to play with her breasts, and in due course this is what the applicant did. He told her things such as that this sort of conduct would assist in the growth of her breasts. It is, as I have said, unnecessary to elaborate the facts further. They are evidently most serious and the sentencing judge rightly viewed them as such. 
     4 The prescribed maximum penalty for the offences of sexual intercourse was eight years imprisonment. In the event, his Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment on each of the counts to which he pleaded guilty for six years, and he specified a non-parole period of four years, rejecting a submission that he should reduce the non-parole period by reason of special circumstances. 
     5 The challenge advanced by counsel is broadly based upon a submission that a less severe sentence was warranted. A number of matters were canvassed, the first of which was an alleged error by his Honour in reference to the applicant's prior good character. He had prior good character in the sense that he had been born in 1946 and before the current matters, had no prior convictions. In the course of his remarks on sentence, the learned judge observed that the offences to which the applicant had pleaded guilty were of such a nature that previous good character is not particularly relevant. 
     6 Part of the argument advanced both in writing and orally before this Court is focused upon the judgment of the High Court in Ryan v The Queen 2001 75 ALJR 815. As was pointed out in submissions on behalf of the Crown, that was a case where the error identified was by a trial judge concluding that the then offender should have no leniency for otherwise good character because, as that judge observed, priests were expected to be of such good character. The judge, in this case, did not express a conclusion that the applicant should have no leniency. Whilst it may not be an altogether accurate summation of the current state of the law emanating from this Court that good character is not particularly relevant, I would not conclude that his Honour gave it no weight at all. The argument is based upon the proposition that the end result achieved by his Honour is such that a conclusion that he gave no weight at all can be reached. Several other matters were referred to in the context of that argument. They included the likely service of the applicant's term on protection along with most other offenders in like circumstances and the applicant's ill-health. 
     7 Reference was made to the applicant's pleas of guilty. It is true that the second complainant was not required to give evidence and the first complainant was not cross-examined, however, from a utilitarian point of view, there would seem to have been little benefit to the community in that the trial was not only prepared, but was underway at the time. 
     8 On the question of the plea of guilty as manifesting contrition, the material before his Honour contradicted that circumstance. Indeed, the report of the Probation and Parole officer specified: 
      
       
        
         
         Mr Percival confirmed his pleas of guilty in relation to the offences, however, he claimed that he had not committed either offence and had not engaged in any illegal or sexually inappropriate behaviour in relation to the victims. Mr Percival claimed he entered guilty pleas after receiving legal advice that it was too late now to change his position. 
         
        
       
     9 It would be hardly surprising if his Honour did not regard the applicant as manifesting contrition. 
     10 Reference was made to the published statistics from the Judicial Commission's collections. Mr Haesler of counsel for the applicant, correctly recognised that the real range for an individual offence lies between a non-custodial sentence and the maximum prescribed by Parliament of eight years. Nevertheless, he drew attention to the circumstance, that on the published statistics the sentences imposed upon the applicant were toward the top of the range. The learned judge expressly recognised that his initial assessment was close to the maximum for a single count. 
     11 I have said elsewhere and I repeat that there is in such submissions almost implied an alleged error that the upper limit of the statistical range is appropriate to the most serious or approaching the worst case. The worst case, of course, is potentially liable to attract the maximum sentence prescribed by Parliament. If, as the submission implies, there should be persistently selected sentences lying somewhere in the middle of the range, then inexorably the upper limit of the statistical range will reduce. This is, as I have said before, not a matter of jurisprudence but a matter of simple arithmetic. Therefore, as I have said, it was correct for Mr Haesler to recognise where the real range lay, but it does not seem to me to manifest any error on his Honour's part that serious offences such as these have attracted impositions close to the upper limit of the published statistical range. 
     12 The final matter advanced on behalf of the applicant referred to his Honour's conclusion that there were no special circumstances, or to be more accurate, that he did not find there were special circumstances justifying a departure from the proportions mentioned in the statute. A finding of special circumstances or their absence, like other findings made by a trial judge, is a matter of fact. In this case, the evidence does not demonstrate that his Honour was wrong, neither does the argument. For my part, I would not intervene to alter his Honour's conclusion. Accordingly, although I would grant leave to appeal, I would propose that the appeal be dismissed. 
     13 WOOD CJ at CL: I agree. The order of the Court will be as Grove J has proposed.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 WOOD CJ AT CL: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence imposed upon him by his Honour Judge Gibson QC in the District Court at Penrith on 10 November 2000. 
      
       
     2 Upon that occasion his Honour had before him two sets of offences which had come before his Honour Judge Neild and himself during the previous year, and which had initially been dealt with on a non-custodial basis. In summary, they involved the following circumstances: 
      
       
        
       Offences committed against his daughter SH 
       
     3 Between 2 November 1993 and 1 November 1997 the applicant committed one offence of aggravated sexual assault (s 61 J Crimes Act 1900, for which the maximum available sentence was imprisonment for 20 years), and four offences of aggravated indecent assault (s 61 M Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 7 years). The first of the offences involved him inserting his erect penis in the victim's mouth after telling her that he was going to place a lolly into it. The other offences involved him requiring her to remove her underpants and to sit upon his exposed penis while he rubbed it on the outside of her vagina until he ejaculated.  
      
       
     4 She was aged between five and eight years when these offences occurred. Their seriousness was compounded by the instruction which the applicant gave to her not to tell anyone, and by the circumstance that he ""told her off"" when he discovered that certain of the incidents had been reported to her mother. After DOCS had been contacted he approached police and made partial admissions concerning his misconduct. 
      
       
     5 This series of offences came before the Local Court on 29 June 1998 and the applicant there entered pleas of guilty. He was assessed as suitable for the Cedar Cottage programme and entered a treatment agreement for 2 years commencing on 7 July 1998. 
      
       
     6 When he appeared before Judge Neild on 31 March 1999, he was sentenced, in compliance with an undertaking under s 33 of the Pre-trial Diversion of Offenders Act 1985, to complete the programme. 
      
       
        
       Offences involving his niece KY. 
       
     7 These offences had been committed at an earlier time than those involving his daughter and spanned a period between 1 June 1985 and 1 November 1987. There were, in this respect, one count of sexual intercourse with a child under 16 and under the applicant's authority, (s 61 D, (1 A) Crimes Act for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 12 years), one count of sexual intercourse with a child under 16, (s 61 D(1) of the Crimes Act, for which the maximum penalty available is 10 years imprisonment), and three counts of the indecent assault (s 61 E Crimes Act for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for four years). 
      
       
     8 The most serious of these offences occurred at a time when the victim was staying at the applicant's home. On this occasion he rubbed her genitals, placed her hand on his genitals and masturbated himself until he ejaculated upon her vagina, whereupon he placed his finger inside her vagina. The other count of sexual intercourse similarly involved digital penetration, while the indecent assaults involved rubbing the victim's genitals.  
      
       
     9 All of the offences occurred while the victim was aged 8 years of age or younger and took place either at her home or at the applicant's home. Again, the victim was instructed not to tell anyone and warned that she would get into trouble if she did. She remained quiet until she was 15 years old at which stage she indicated that she wanted counselling. 
      
       
     10 These offences came before His Honour Judge Gibson on 8 October 1999 on which the date the applicant pleaded guilty. On 9 December 1999 his Honour sentenced the applicant to a 3 years good behaviour bond with a condition that he complete the Cedar Cottage programme and obey all of its rules and all reasonable instructions of the Director of the programme. 
      
       
        
       Failure to complete the Cedar Cottage Programme. 
       
     11 On 23 October 2000 the Director of Cedar Cottage notified the Crown that the applicant had breached his undertakings by forwarding parcels and letters to his sons. This followed an earlier decision that he be suspended and recommended for exclusion from the programme. The report provided suggested that he had not validated the victim’s accounts of the earlier offences, and had failed to submit goals or to properly complete the manuals and sex log which he was required to maintain. Additionally, it was reported that he had failed to demonstrate accountability for his conduct in withholding details about his use of the Internet and that he had shown no evidence of the knowledge which he was expected to be gaining through the programme to confront relapse prevention. His inadequate performance was noted to be long standing. 
      
       
     12 As a consequence, breach proceedings were commenced and the applicant was called up for sentence, in relation to all matters, before his Honour Judge Gibson. 
      
       
        
       The sentence.  
       
     13 When appearing before his Honour the applicant adhered to the pleas of guilty. 
      
       
     14 He was sentenced in respect of the offences committed upon his daughter as follows: 
      
       
       Count 1 
       : Aggravated sexual assault: 5 years imprisonment with a non parole period of 3 years 9 months, each to date from 3 November 2000 with a non parole period to expire on 2 August 2004. 
        
       Counts 2 to 5 
       : Aggravated indecent assaults. On each count fixed terms of imprisonment for 2 years to commence on 3 November 2000 and to expire on 2 November 2002. 
       
     15 In relation to the offence committed upon his niece he was sentenced as follows.16 Count 5: Sexual intercourse with a child under 16 years under authority: 4 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years, each to commence on 3 August 2004 with a non-parole period expiring on 2 August 2006. 
      
       
       Count 4 
       : Sexual intercourse with a child under 16 years: Fixed term of imprisonment for three years to commence on 3 November 2000 and to expire on 2 November 2003. 
        
       Counts 1 to 3 
       : Indecent assault: Each count fixed term of imprisonment for 18 months, similarly to commence on 3 November 2000 and to expire on 2 May 2002. 
        
       
     17 Special circumstances were found, confined to the fact of accumulation of sentence for the offence of sexual intercourse with his niece, as a person under his authority, that accumulation having been upon the non-parole period for the aggravated sexual assault of his daughter. 
      
       
        
       The Appeal.  
       
     18 The applicant has submitted that, while his Honour ""comprehensively addressed all relevant sentencing matters"", nevertheless the sentences imposed, and as accumulated, were ""excessive in all the circumstances."" Additionally, it has been submitted that his Honour addressed the question of special circumstances on too narrow a basis. It is convenient to deal with these grounds separately. 
      
       
        
       Were the sentences excessive? 
       
     19 In addressing this submission, the applicant accepted that a bare review of the Judicial Commission statistics would show that for a s 61J offence, following a guilty plea, an effective sentence in the order of 7 years 9 months would have been within range, as would have a sentence of 4 to 6 years for a s 61 D (1 A) matter. However, it was submitted, error was disclosed once a calculation was made, in order to find what would have been ""the starting point"", absent any allowance for the plea and other mitigating circumstances. That calculation, it was submitted, should involve, for convenience and comparison purposes, four steps, namely: adding 30% to the sentences imposed, this being the total allowance which his Honour stated that he had made for all the mitigating circumstances; · adding an amount for delay since the matters first came to notice; · then adding an amount for the time and effort involved in relation to the Cedar Cottage programme, and finally, · adding an amount of time for delay in relation to the offence involving his niece, KY. 
      
       
     20 Additionally, it was suggested that the discount for the pleas, in respect of the offences involving the niece, should have been greater than 30 percent because of their utilitarian value, their reflection of genuine remorse and the saving of the complainant from the ordeal of giving evidence. 
      
       
     21 I am unpersuaded by this submission, despite the careful submissions of Mr Button. It appears to me to depend upon an artificial process of sentencing which has been rejected at an appellate level. For example, in R v Haye (2001) NSWCCA 358, Sully J observed: 
      
       
        
         
           
          
         ""... The correct starting point is not an enthusiastic plunge into the arithmetic of the discount that has been allowed, or has not been allowed, or should or should not, or might or night not have been allowed. The starting point is a level-headed understanding of the objective criminality of what has been done."" 
          
         
        
       
     22 Similarly, McHugh J in AB v The Queen (1999) 198 CLR 111, in rejecting the so called ""two tier approach"" to sentencing as an erroneous approach, said that he did so because it ""attempts to give the process of sentencing a degree of exactness which the subject can rarely bear."" 
      
       
     23 An application of the approach suggested by the applicant, in the present case, which requires an accumulation of the discounts referable to each of the discrete favourable subjective circumstances found to exist, inevitably risks producing a sentence which is wholly disproportionate for the objective and subjective circumstances involved. This is because there is a degree of overlap between them. The probability of overlap of this kind was clearly identified by Gleeson CJ in R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220 AT 227-228. 
      
       
     24 Ultimately, the question for a sentencing judge is to determine ""what is the appropriate punishment for the particular offence in the relevant circumstances."". See Deane J, in Channon v The Queen (1978) 20 ALR 1 at 18. 
      
       
     25 The discounts of 30 percent for all offences, in my view, adequately reflected all of the favourable subjective circumstance that were found to exist, including the applicant's prior good character, his attempts to undertake the Cedar Cottage Programme, the delay in the proceedings and the utilitarian value of the pleas. None of those factors was overlooked. I see no basis for the submission that the pleas, in the case of the offences involving the niece, were given in circumstances which might have attracted a discount as high as 30% on that account alone. Any such discount would be well in excess of that suggested in the guideline judgment of R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, and would be unmerited. 
      
       
     26 It was also submitted, in this regard, that his Honour's assessment of the applicant's failure to complete the Cedar Cottage programme was too harsh and that his problems in not doing so, were related either to the somewhat vague ""psychogenic factors"" which Dr Warwick John Taylor mentioned in his report, or to a ""severe remorse syndrome or post traumatic stress disorder"" relating to the offending of the kind which Dr Clarke appears to have diagnosed. 
      
       
     27 I am not persuaded that his Honour erred in preferring the reports from the Cedar Cottage staff, by reason of the time which they had put in with the applicant, which in his Honour's assessment, gave them a better background and insight into his performance. Those reports did not in fact attribute to him any deliberate obstruction, or suggest that he was feigning an ability to recall events. Rather, they were directed to the fact that, in a number of respects, he had not fulfilled the goals or directives of the staff and that as a consequence he was excluded from the programme. Neither Dr Taylor nor Dr Clark suggested that his evaluation was inappropriate, nor could they have done so, given its structure and goals. 
      
       
     28 The applicant's exclusion did have several consequences. First, he was denied the opportunity of completing the diversionary procedure. Secondly, for whatever reason, it threw a real doubt on the extent of his insight and prospects of rehabilitation. It was to that aspect that I am satisfied his Honour was directing himself when he noted that the prisoner had not faced up to the seriousness of the offences. The fact of his attempt to go through the programme was not entirely ignored, since his Honour expressly observed that he was entitled to consideration for this. 
      
       
     29 Had his Honour been of the view that the applicant's lack of co-operation was deliberate, and that he had not entered the programme in good faith, then it is difficult to imagine that any such consideration would have been extended toward him. 
      
       
     30 Next, it was submitted that his Honour's observation that he was ""not convinced that (the applicant) does not remain a danger to other young girls"" involved a reversal of the onus which lies upon the Crown to prove matters in aggravation. If, by this observation, his Honour had suggested that the onus fell upon the applicant to prove that he was no longer at a risk of reoffending, or was not a danger to the community, then that would have been an error of law. 
      
       
     31 Otherwise, in the light of the history of offending by the applicant and his failure to complete the intensive diversionary programme to the satisfaction of its directors, it was inevitable that he be assessed as posing some risk of reoffending and lacking the insight necessary in this regard. It was to that circumstance that I am satisfied his Honour directed his attention. 
      
       
     32 I observe, finally, in relation to the last two submissions, that this is a Court of error and it does not disturb findings of fact made by sentencing judges unless there is an absence of evidence to support them, or if the evidence all points in the opposite way: See Khouzame (2000) NSWCCA 505. His Honour was much better placed to assess the facts having regard to the lengthy history of the proceedings, and I am not persuaded that the conclusions to which he came were unsupported by the evidence or that he approached them upon an erroneous basis. 
      
       
     33 In a case such as the present, where no error of sentencing principle appears on the face of the reasons, the task which the applicant faces is to show that there was such a disproportion between the sentences imposed and those properly available within the range of a legitimate exercise of sentencing discretion, so as to manifest error: See Elemes (2000) NSWCCA 235. 
      
       
     34 The fact that the Court of Criminal Appeal may have taken a different approach if it been in the position of the primary Judge is never enough: See House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 503, which was approved in AB, and in Dindsale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321. Before it can intervene the court must be satisfied that some sentence other than that imposed was warranted in law and should have been imposed. Otherwise it must dismiss the appeal: s 6 Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  
      
       
     35 In this case I am unpersuaded that any sentence other than those imposed should have been passed. The offences were very serious, they were prolonged and the victims were very young girls who were entitled to look to the applicant for protection rather than defilement. The stern attitude which the Courts take to the sexual assault of young persons, the need for condign punishment, and the significant elements of general and personal deterrence which are called for are well recognised. See R v BJW (2000) NSWCCA 60 R v JVP NSWCCA 6 November 1995, and R v Bamford NSWCCA 23 July 1991. Accumulation of sentence was also clearly appropriate here, in order to reflect the total criminality involved. 
      
       
     36 This aspect of the applicant's submission is, therefore, not made good. 
      
       
        
        Special circumstances. 
       
     37 It was submitted that his Honour took too narrow a view of “special circumstances” in not finding such circumstances to exist, in relation to the longest of the sentences first imposed (hereafter referred to as the ""first lead sentence""); and in confining any such finding to the fact of accumulation, so far as the longest of the second sets of sentences (hereafter referred to as a ""second lead sentence""), was concerned. 
      
       
     38 In this regard the ratio between the non parole periods and head sentences respectively were as follows: 
      
       
       (a) first lead sentence 75% 
        
       (b) second lead sentence 50% 
        
       (c) total sentence with accumulation 74% 
        
       
     39 The sentencing order resulted in an overall head sentence of 7 years and 9 months expiring on 2 August 2008, with a non-parole period of 5 years and 9 months, thereby providing a potential period of release subject to supervision on parole of 2 years. Had special circumstances not been found in relation to the second lead sentence, by reason of its accumulation upon the non parole period for the first lead sentence, that clearly would have resulted in a potential period of release which would have been too low. 
      
       
     40 Notwithstanding that adjustment, which was properly made in accordance with authorities, see for example Clarke (1995) 78 A Crim R 226 and Simpson NSWCCA 18 June 1992, it is now submitted that further special circumstances should have been found relating to the age and health of the applicant, to the fact that this was his first experience of imprisonment, and to the partial progress, which he had made through the Cedar Cottage programme towards his rehabilitation. 
      
       
     41 Reliance was placed upon the proposition that the decision in R v Hameed (2001) NSWCCA 287 authorised a more generous approach to this question than that which Sperling J had there described as the ""strict approach."" That was a decision of a Court constituted by two judges. So far as it purported to decide an issue of sentencing principle, upon which there were thought to be differing views from Courts comprised of three judges I do not consider that it can be regarded as authoritative. Similarly, it would be inappropriate for this court to embark upon the task of deciding or settling a matter of sentencing principle, as to what may properly be regarded as a ""special circumstance."" That is currently reserved to a five judge bench. 
      
       
     42 Irrespective of whether the stricter or more liberal view is taken, I am not persuaded that occasion arises, in this case, to intervene. The applicant was aged 49 when he appeared for sentence. He was not shown to have any ongoing signs of physical illness or mental illness, beyond the remorse and stress associated with his prosecution and imprisonment. Neither factor could, on any view, have provided a basis for reduction in the non parole period. The fact of this being his first experience of imprisonment, and the need for post release supervision and counselling, both by reference to that matter and also by reference to the interest of rehabilitation, were adequately reflected in the two year period that was potentially available for his release on parole. 
      
       
     43 For this court to intervene, in order to reduce the proportions between the non parole period and the head sentences, either individually or as a whole, would result in a minimum period of imprisonment which would fall below that appropriate to reflect the total criminality involved. That, it has been accepted, should not occur: See Morrissey NSW CCA 15 July 1994 and McDonald NSW CCA 12 October 1998. 
      
       
     44 I would, accordingly, grant leave to appeal but I would dismiss the appeal. 
      
       
     45 GROVE J: I agree. 
      
       
     46 WOOD CJ AT CL: The order of the court will, therefore, be as I have proposed.

      REGINA v SCOTT CHRISTOPHER BOARDMAN 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
     1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Gibson QC upon the applicant at Bathurst District Court.  
     2 The applicant appeared before his Honour and pleaded guilty to an offence of supplying a prohibited drug on an ongoing basis, contrary to s25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. He appeared for sentence with his de facto wife, charged with an identical offence. His Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for three years and nine months with a non-parole period of two years and ten months.  
     3 As can be derived from that sentence, his Honour found that there were no special circumstances justifying departure from the proportion mentioned in the statute in relation to the non parole period.  
     4 The applicant's de facto wife was sentenced to three years' imprisonment and a non parole period of twelve months was specified. In her case his Honour found that there were special circumstances. He mentioned that there were two dependent children who would be, for a time, separated from their parents. He also found that the applicant's wife had prospects of rehabilitation. 
     5 The contrary finding in the case of the applicant was made available not only from the applicant's long record and long association with drugs, to which he was addicted, but also from the information before his Honour by way of pre-sentence reporting which indicated little hope that the applicant, now a man of forty-one years, might conscientiously devote himself towards rehabilitation.  
     6 The facts of the offences are not exceedingly complicated. The applicant and his wife each sold drugs to undercover police officers. It was mentioned that, in the case of the wife, there were four sales whereas in the case of the applicant there were three. The Statute creates a specific offence where at least three supplies are made within a span of thirty days.  
     7 In support of the application, counsel has canvassed in broad terms three matters. As I am of the view that one of his arguments had been made out, it will suffice, for present purposes, to refer only briefly to the others. 
     8 It was contended that the sentencing judge erred in finding that the applicant was making a commercial profit from the supply of drugs. There was evidence before his Honour that on police search the applicant's wife was found to have $720 in cash in her purse. She had claimed that the source of this money was not tainted by drug dealing. It was obviously a matter that was the subject of challenge and his Honour found against the claim of the applicant's wife.  
     9 It is clear that the applicant and his wife were engaged in the enterprise under consideration, in a sense, in a joint fashion. There was no evidence before his Honour of any ledger or other book keeping whereby moneys received from their activities were kept in discriminate amounts. It seems to me that his Honour was entirely justified in coming to the conclusion which he did that both the applicant and his wife were, as well as obtaining money as a result of supplying in order to feed their own respective habits, that they were making some commercial profit out of it.  
     10 No doubt these moneys also went to the usual destinations of payment for the support of the family and the acquisition of needs. Nevertheless, that is a commercial activity distinguishable from activity which is purely directed towards feeding a drug habit.  
     11 The second matter to which I will make but brief reference is a complaint concerning the application of what are contended to be principles of parity. Given the applicant's record and its comparison with his wife, no complaint could have been made about their respective head sentences of three years and nine months and three years. An argument has sought to be developed that, by reason of principles of parity, the learned judge ought to have specified a non parole period in respect of the applicant which was co-ordinate with the specification in relation to his wife. Accepting such a submission would lead to the curious result that in a case where no special circumstances were found, his Honour would, nevertheless, find special circumstances for the purpose of achieving the result which counsel has contended should follow.  
     12 In my view, no authority, and in particular Postiglione v The Queen 1997 189 CLR 295 either requires or authorises such an approach. I see no error in his Honour's conclusion that there were no special circumstances in the relevant sense demonstrated in relation to the applicant and I would add that, were I deciding the matter for myself, I would reach the same conclusion.  
     13 I return, however, to the argument advanced by the applicant which, in my view, ought to be sustained. In the evidence there was admitted the transcript of the product of a listening device which included conversation between the applicant and an undercover police officer in which the applicant clearly asserted that once he had possession of some electronic scales it was his intention, in effect, to expand the scope of his criminal operations. 
     14 This was a matter in dispute before his Honour and he came to the conclusion that a Crown contention that it was the intention of both the applicant and his wife to embark upon expanding their business was made out beyond reasonable doubt. I consider that the evidence was admissible. It was available to rebut any suggestion by the applicant or, for that matter, by his wife that the particular incidents which constituted the charge were entirely isolated.  
     15 It would also be available to rebut any suggestion that they intended to close down or desist from any further criminal activity. What it was not available for was to take into account, in assessing the criminality of the charge actually brought against the applicant. If this was done it would suggest inevitably, in my view, that his Honour is likely to have imposed a greater sentence than he otherwise would have done. 
     16 There are two passages from his Honour's remarks on sentence which point to his Honour having done so. When first referring to this matter he said:  
      
       
        
         
         ""The second point that was in dispute was whether he intended in the future to, or they had intended in the future to embark upon selling and supplying larger amounts, and I am not talking about pounds. I am talking about half weights and weights, as they refer to them.  
         
        
        
         
         She had told the police officer that that was their intention and when he was speaking to the person Boardman, and it was taken on tape, Boardman agreed with that as to what they intended to do in the future when he got a fresh set of scales.  
         
        
        
         
         I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that was their intention, to embark upon expanding their business to an extent."" 
         
        
       
     17 The second reference during his Honour's remarks on sentence occurred as his Honour was adverting to matters which would be taken into account in assessing the criminality of the applicant's activities. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Now, I am not suggesting that the business that was being run by these two people was enormous. It was a smallish scale supply. They were engaged actively in supplying these things for money and it is a factor to be taken into consideration that the supplies were small amounts but it was also a factor that they were looking at expanding in the future and it was a matter where, as I say, they were prepared to supply this man, who was an undercover police officer, with very little introduction other than him mentioning the name of someone else that, apparently, supplies around the locality."" 
         
        
       
     18 As I have indicated, I am persuaded that the applicant has succeeded in demonstrating the error contended on his behalf by counsel. It is appropriate then for this Court to consider the question of re-sentence. On that matter, the Crown has submitted that no other sentence would be appropriate and that therefore, in accordance with the terms of the Statute, the application and the appeal should, in any event, be dismissed.  
     19 For my part, I am unable to sustain that submission. It seems to me, as I have already indicated, that it ought to be concluded that, in making the reference which his Honour did to expansion of the activities of the applicant and his wife, there is a clear suggestion that he would have taken that into account in assessing the quantum of sentence to be imposed.  
     20 The applicant is, however, without a great deal of material to support any lenience. He has a considerable record and his prospects of rehabilitation would seem to be poor. I have already mentioned his long term addiction to drugs. 
     21 I, like his Honour, would not find special circumstances but I would rather assess the head sentence to impose a sentence equivalent to that received by the applicant's wife.  
     22 I, therefore, propose the following orders: 
      
      
       
       1. That the application for leave to appeal be granted. 
        
       2. That the appeal be allowed and the sentence below quashed. 
        
       3. In lieu thereof, the applicant be sentenced to imprisonment for three years, to commence on 12 July 2000 and to expire on 11 July 2003. I would specify a non parole period of two years and three months also commencing on 12 July 2000 and to expire on 11 October 2002.  
        
       4. Given the length of sentence, the Court should order that the applicant be released to parole on 11 October 2002.  
        
       
     23 HOWIE J: I agree. I simply wish to add a few comments of my own in respect of the first ground of appeal: that is, that his Honour erred in finding that the applicant was involved in a commercial enterprise.  
     24 It seems to me, with respect, that the hearing before his Honour and his Honour's remarks on sentence proceeded on a misconception and that is that before his Honour could find that the applicant was supplying for a commercial purpose, that his Honour had to make a finding that the $750 found in the applicant's wife's purse was as a result of the drug dealing and that the applicant had, in effect, possession of that money as well as his wife.  
     25 In my view, a person in the position of the applicant who is supplying drugs on an ongoing basis as a business and is charged with an offence under s 25A would be hard put indeed to satisfy a Court that the enterprise was not of a commercial nature.  
     26 I put it in that way because in my view the onus is upon the offender to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that the supply of drugs was only to permit him to purchase drugs for his own use.  
     27 I would have thought that the overwhelming inference from the evidence before his Honour of the dealings by the applicant and his wife was that it was done, not simply to allow the applicant and his wife to purchase drugs for their use, but also generally to obtain money which was used by the family. That was the finding his Honour made. In my view, it would be almost absurd to suggest that persons who are in business, such as the applicant and his wife, kept accounting records and were so meticulous in relation to their supplying of drugs that they supplied merely only to provide enough money for them to be able to purchase drugs to use for themselves and no more. Clearly there was no evidence before his Honour that this is what the applicant and his wife did and it seems to me that a simple evaluation of the objective evidence would indicate that was not what occurred.  
     28 It seems to me that if a person in the position of the applicant wishes to be sentenced on the basis that he was supplying only for the purposes of obtaining his own drugs for his own use and, therefore, to achieve whatever mitigation on sentence might flow from that fact, then he had the onus of proving, on the balance of probabilities, that that fact should be found by the sentencing judge. I am not suggesting for one moment that his Honour would have been entitled to sentence the applicant on the basis that he was in the business of supply as a matter of greed in order to make a living from it. If he were to find that as a finding of fact it might well be it would have to be found beyond reasonable doubt. That would then be truly a matter of aggravation but in my view the simple fact that the applicant was supplying drugs for a commercial purpose, albeit also to be able to finance his own drug addiction, was not a matter of aggravation at all, it was a matter which flowed simply from the charge with which the applicant was charged and the objective facts to prove that charge. 
     29 GROVE J: The orders of the Court will be as I have proposed.

      REGINA v Donald Michael BETT 
       
       
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 HODGSON JA: I will ask Simpson J to give the first judgment. 
      
       
     2 SIMPSON J: This is a Crown appeal against the asserted leniency of a sentence of three years imprisonment with a non-parole period of one year to be served by way of periodic detention imposed upon the respondent in the District Court at Wagga Wagga following his plea of guilty to a charge of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm. A maximum sentence of seven years imprisonment for the offence is prescribed by s 35(b) of the Crimes Act 1900. 
      
       
     3 In allocating the proportions of the total term and the non-parole period the sentencing Judge necessarily, or by implication, found special circumstances warranting departure from the formula contained in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, although he did not give reasons for that departure. 
      
       
     4 The objective circumstances of the crime were very serious indeed. The victim was a sixty-two year old man who walked with the aid of a walking stick. At about 8.30 p.m. on the evening of Sunday 10 December 2000 he was walking in a Temora street. The respondent, accompanied by his girlfriend, was driving a car in the same street. He drove close to the victim, skidded to a halt, alighted from the vehicle, and approached the victim. He took the victim by the throat and shook him. The two engaged in a struggle for a short time and the respondent punched the victim in the face several times, causing the victim to stumble backwards. The victim regained his balance, the respondent again lunged at him, and the victim struck at the respondent with his walking stick. The respondent gained possession of the walking stick and threw it away. The victim kicked the respondent. The respondent took the victim in a headlock and again punched him several times in the face. The respondent threw the victim to the ground, causing the back of his head to strike the kerb. The respondent took the victim by the throat with his left hand and continued punching him with his right hand. The respondent then left the victim and drove off. 
      
       
     5 As a result of the incident the victim has lost the sight of his right eye. Bones in both cheeks were broken, requiring surgery. He sustained a broken nose and lacerations and suffered headaches for a time. 
      
       
     6 The respondent was twenty years of age at the time. He was known to the victim and there was never any question that he was the person responsible for the attack. On 24 January 2001 he attended the Temora Police Station with his father and surrendered himself for arrest. He declined to be interviewed, but agreed to have his refusal to do so electronically recorded. 
      
       
     7 On the face of it the attack by the respondent on the victim was entirely unprovoked and, having regard to the subjective matters which emerged, inexplicable. In oral evidence the respondent provided the only explanation for his conduct. This was that his girlfriend, about the same age as he, had earlier told him that the victim had sexually assaulted her over a period of seven years, beginning when she was six years of age and ending when she was thirteen. Having sought counselling, she had decided not to pursue her allegations by reporting them to police. Further, immediately before the attack his girlfriend told him that the victim had made a throat slitting gesture in her direction. The respondent had not personally witnessed this event. 
      
       
     8 It need hardly be observed that, whether or not the allegations of sexual assault or the allegation of the threatening gesture said to be made by the victim are true, those circumstances provide no excuse for the respondent's conduct. At most they provide an explanation for behaviour that was, on the evidence, completely out of character and otherwise inexplicable. 
      
       
     9 In the sentencing proceedings the respondent advanced a powerful subjective case. He was born on 14 October 1980 and was, as I have noted above, just twenty years of age at the time. He had no criminal history of any kind. Oral evidence of his character was given by his parish priest and his mother, and fifteen written character references were tendered. They were unanimous in their descriptions of the respondent's good character. He retained the support of his very large extended family, who are well known and respected in the Temora district and many of whom attended the sentencing proceedings as concrete evidence of their support. 
      
       
     10 At the time of sentencing the respondent held employment as a labourer, working for his father and other contractors. He expressed remorse for what he had done, supporting this by saying that he had lost fifteen kilograms in weight and had not had a decent night's sleep since the incident. His Honour appears to have accepted this expression as genuine. The respondent said that his conduct had absolutely devastated his family. 
      
       
     11 The sentencing Judge correctly described the offence as ""a very grave example indeed"" of its kind and recognised that, in the ordinary course, it would necessarily attract a period of full time custody. However, he described the subjective case made out by the respondent as ""exceptional"". He accepted that what the respondent had been told about his girlfriend's earlier relationship with the victim and about the apparent threat by the victim were the factors that precipitated the offence. He described this conduct as ""absolutely an aberration"" which was nevertheless inexcusable but, equally, unlikely to be repeated. 
      
       
     12 He recognised the need to balance the extremely serious objective features of the offence against the ""exceptional"" subjective circumstances. That balance led him to impose the sentence that he did. 
      
       
     13 In written submissions the Crown contended that two errors are to be detected in the sentencing Judge's approach, although it seems to me they are two sides of the same coin. The first is it is erroneous to label the subjective case as ""exceptional""; secondly, that undue weight was given to the subjective case at the expense of the undoubtedly serious objective features. 
      
       
     14 In oral argument the Crown added that there was no or inadequate reference to questions of general deterrence which feature significantly in the sentence to be imposed in this case. 
      
       
     15 I think it is correct to say that the description of the objective case as exceptional was an overstatement. The subjective case was very favourable but not, in my opinion, exceptional. However, properly analysed, it seems to me that what his Honour really meant was that the respondent's foray into such a vicious and unwarranted assault on the victim, when taken in conjunction with his prior character, was exceptional, and I do not consider this to be erroneous. 
      
       
     16 Nevertheless, it would be wrong to lose sight not only of what the respondent did but also of the very serious injury sustained by the victim. 
      
       
     17 I have come to the view the Crown's argument in the second respect must be accepted. The sentence imposed manifestly failed to reflect the objective gravity of the very serious crime committed and it seems to me clear that his Honour did give excessive weight to the subjective circumstances. The Crown appeal must therefore be allowed and the sentence quashed. 
      
       
     18 The remaining, and more difficult question, is what sentence should be substituted. 
      
       
     19 To my mind, the issue is whether in the circumstances the respondent should be required to serve a term of full time custody or whether an extended sentence to be served by way of periodic detention would achieve the ends of the sentencing policy.  
      
       
     20 The principles governing successful Crown appeals and the imposition of an increased sentence are well known. This court must impose the lowest sentence that could reasonably have been imposed at first instance. The Crown asserts that nothing less than a period of full time custody is sufficient to meet the various purposes of criminal sentencing. I am not prepared to accept this. 
      
       
     21 The respondent was a very young man at the time he offended. He is entitled to the benefit of his prior good character, his genuine remorse, his plea of guilty, his voluntary surrender to the police, limited though that benefit is (it being clear that he was identified as the perpetrator). 
      
       
     22 A further consideration is to be found in the time taken by the Crown in launching this appeal. By s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 the Crown is not bound by time limits that apply to other appellants. However, it is well recognised that a significant delay in lodging an appeal may be a factor in this court's decision whether a Crown appeal should be or should not be allowed. In my view, at least in the circumstances of this case, where the respondent has, so far as the evidence before this court goes, conscientiously discharged the obligations of the order, that fact is also capable of affecting the decision whether a sentence of periodic detention should be converted to one of full time custody. 
      
       
     23 Here the sentence was imposed on 31 May of this year, the order for periodic detention specified to commence on 16 June. The respondent was notified by letter dated 12 June that the Crown was considering an appeal, but no appeal was in fact lodged until 3 August and served a few days later. The consequence is that although the period in which the respondent is required to attend at the periodic detention centre had not expired at the time the Crown appeal was lodged, it has expired at the time the Crown appeal comes on for hearing. 
      
       
     24 The respondent has, so we were told, commenced the second phase of the order for periodic detention, that being served by way of community service. 
      
       
     25 In my opinion, taking all this into account, it is unnecessary to increase the total term of the sentence and unnecessary to interfere with the order that the sentence be served by way of periodic detention. It is the non-parole period that is, in my view, manifestly inadequate. 
      
       
     26 The Crown argued, with some force, that this is a case in which it would not have been surprising to have found the respondent sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment, there being little to be gained by the application of a non-parole period. This submission gained some strength from the absence of reasons given by his Honour for the shortening of the non-parole period and the lengthening of the parole term. However, I think there is material to justify the decision to specify a non-parole period contained in the evidence that was before the sentencing Judge, particularly in light of the fact that this is the first offence committed by the respondent, and certainly the first time he has been subject to any kind of custodial order. So, with some reservations, I would not impose a fixed term. 
      
       
     27 I would not, however, find that there were special circumstances that would warrant departure from the s 44 ratio. I therefore propose that the Crown appeal be allowed, the sentence be quashed, and the respondent be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of three years with a non-parole period of two years and three months to be served by way of periodic detention. 
      
       
     28 HODGSON JA: I agree. 
      
       
     29 BARR J: I agree with the presiding Judge and with Simpson J that, for the reasons given by Simpson J, this appeal should be allowed. 
      
       
     30 I disagree with their Honours about the sentence this court should impose in substitution for that imposed by the sentencing Judge. The injuries sustained by the complainant put this offence, in my view, towards the top of the range of serious offences under s 35(b). Notwithstanding the strong subjective case of the respondent - his youth, his prior good character, his early plea of guilty and his obvious contrition - the offence called for the imposition of a period of full time custody. 
      
       
     31 I think that the minimum period appropriate for this court on the allowance of this Crown appeal would have been a fixed term of twelve months. I would have imposed a period of imprisonment of that length. My reason for not fixing a parole period would be that the respondent had such character, family and community support that there was no need for parole.  
      
       
     32 I would not have taken into account in fixing that sentence the circumstance that the notice of appeal was not served on the respondent until a little over two months after the date of sentence. 
      
       
     33 HODGSON JA: The order of the court is as proposed by Simpson J, the period of imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention commencing on 15 June 2001 and expiring on 14 June 2004. The non-parole period is to commence on 15 June 2001 and expire on 14 September 2003. **********

       Regina v Graham MAILES 
       
     The appellant was found guilty of murder and sentenced to 25 years imprisonment with a minimum fixed term of 18 years. Prior to appearing for trial, an inquiry was conducted into the appellant’s fitness to stand trial pursuant to the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (NSW). The jury found that the appellant was fit to stand trial. The question of the appellant’s possible unfitness was again raised by Counsel before the trial and on separate occasions during the trial, however, the trial Judge declined to order a further fitness hearing.The appellant appeals against the conviction on the ground that the trial miscarried due to (1) the fact that a real question arose at trial as to the appellant’s fitness which should have led to a further fitness hearing and (2) the inability of the appellant’s counsel to obtain instructions from him. Before determining the issue on appeal the Court was required to consider whether an accused who is intellectually disabled, but who does not suffer from a mental illness, can qualify for a fitness hearing under the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990.HELD: (Appeal allowed):1   Ground 1: Scope of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990In light of the legislative history and the approach which the common law has consistently taken, concerning the fundamental right of a person placed on trial to have sufficient understanding of the proceedings so as to be able to make a proper defence, the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act should not be read down so as to exclude the intellectually disabled. To otherwise construe the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act would be to depart from the extended meaning given to the expression ‘mental illness’ in the context of fitness to be tried that has been developed by the common law.R v Young (1999) 46 NSWLR 681; Radway v The Queen (1990) 169 CLR 515 applied. R v Pritchard (1836) & C & P 303; R v Dyson (1831) 7 C & P 305; R v Presser [1958] VR 45; Ngatayi v The Queen (1980) 147 CLR 1; Kesavarajah v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 230; Eastman v The Queen (2000) 74 ALJR 915 considered.2   Ground 2: Refusal to order a further fitness hearingOnce the question of fitness had been raised in good faith there should have been a further fitness hearing. There was clearly a serious question as to the appellant’s fitness, which became even more evident from the bizarre behaviour displayed throughout the course of the trial. Also of importance was the fact the Crown prosecutor accepted that the question of fitness raised by Counsel for the appellant had been raised in good faith. The question of fitness is not determined conclusively at the pre-trial hearing, or at any one hearing during the trial. The question remains open, at least until the jury retires to consider their verdict and possibly until that verdict is returned. While there is a statutory presumption of fitness once a person has been found fit, it still remains necessary for a trial Judge to interrupt proceedings and to direct that there be a further inquiry if a genuine question as to fitness re-emerges, no matter how inconvenient or disruptive that may be.R v Zhang [2000] NSWCCA 344; R v Tier [2001] NSWCCA 53 applied. R v Khallouf (1981) VR 360 considered. Proposed Orders(1) Appeal allowed.(2) Conviction and sentence quashed and a new trial ordered

      FRIDAY 19th OCTOBER 2001 
       
       
       Regina v Graham MAILES 
        
        
       JUDGMENT 
       
     1   SPIGELMAN CJ: I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Wood CJ at CL in draft. I agree with his Honour’s reasons. I wish to add a few brief observations. 
     2   I agree with his Honour’s analysis of the history of the common law and legislation on the subject of fitness to plead. I agree with his Honour’s conclusion that the references to the question of a person’s unfitness to be tried where appearing in several sections of Part 2 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (“the Act”), should not be read down so as to be limited to unfitness by reason of mental illness or mental disorder. This is not a case in which the title of the Act (with its reference to “mental health”) or the heading of the Part (with its reference to “mental disorders”) is of any assistance in the construction of the general words “unfitness to be tried”. 
     3   The scheme for which Part 2 provides is, as his Honour shows, the most recent mechanism for deciding matters for which the common law and statute law has long made provision of a character which cannot be confined in this manner. The issue of fitness for trial relates to fundamental principles of our criminal procedure, as emphasised most recently in the judgments of the High Court in Eastman v The Queen (2000) 74 ALJR 915, to which Wood CJ at CL refers. The Parliament has not purported to define, let alone by implication to restrict, the facts, matters and circumstances which could render a person unfit to stand trial. 
     4   In the present case an inquiry was conducted under s10(1)(a) of the Act. In his reasons for refusing a further inquiry, when a fresh application was made on behalf of the Appellant pursuant to s10(1)(b) of the Act, Newman J said: 
      
       
       “If it be that the nature of the matters raised relating to the question of unfitness to be tried was different on an application such as the present, I would regard that as being a fresh application. In other words, an application falling within section 10(1)(b). But where the evidence which is sought to be adduced in the prospective inquiry is, in nature, no different from that which was raised before, albeit evidence coming from different witnesses, I am of the view that in those circumstances, it not being a matter going to a new inquiry, all that is being sought, it seems to me, is to reventilate a matter which has already been determined pursuant to an inquiry arising under section 10(1)(a).” 
       
     5   On the second occasion during the trial that Mr Golding, who appeared for the Appellant before Newman J, raised the issue of unfitness, his Honour said: 
      
       
       “There is no other matter which Mr Golding can put before me which is fresh material, as against the material which was brought in the original proceedings before the jury; fresh in the sense that it means that some change has occurred. Accordingly, I decline that application for the type of reasons which I gave on the first day of this trial”. 
       
     6   Nothing in the Act states that once any inquiry into fitness has occurred, no further inquiry can be permitted unless the evidence is in some way “different” or “fresh”. The relevant provisions are set out in the judgment of Wood CJ at CL and it is unnecessary to set them all out again. 
     7   The possibility that more than one inquiry into fitness may occur in the course of the same proceedings is contemplated by the legislative scheme. Subsection 7(1) expressly states that the question of a person’s unfitness “may be raised at any time” and subs 7(2) makes it clear that nothing in s7 prevents the question being raised “on more than one occasion”. That matter is put beyond doubt by the express provision of s15 that: 
      
       
       “15. It is to be presumed: 
        
       … 
        
       (b) that a person who has, in accordance with this Part, been found fit to be tried for an offence continues to be fit to be tried for the offence until the contrary is, on the balance of probabilities, determined to be the case.” 
       
     8   By s10(1), a Court “must” conduct an inquiry once “the question” of “unfitness” is raised, but this obligation operates “except as provided by this section”. The prospect of multiple applications is controlled by express provision in subs 10(2) which prohibits the Court from conducting an inquiry in certain circumstances. It states: 
      
       
       “The Court must not conduct an inquiry into the question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for an offence unless it appears to the Court that the question has been raised in good faith.” 
       
     9   In my opinion, the “good faith” referred to in subs 10(2) is that of the accused. The formulation that a “question” of “unfitness” is “raised”, first appears in s5 of the Act which permits such a question to “be raised by any party to the proceeding” or by the Court itself. The words “by any party” should be construed to mean “by or on behalf of any party”. 
     10   Counsel appearing for a party may “raise” such a matter on behalf of the party. The exigencies in which an issue of this character will often arise are such that the question of instructions from an accused is problematic, as was the situation in the present case. Nevertheless, the “question” of “unfitness” is “raised” by or on behalf of the “party” and not by counsel. “Good faith” in subs 10(2) refers to the “good faith” of the person by or on behalf of whom the “question has been raised”. 
     11   Where, as sometimes occurs, apparent unfitness is accompanied by an insistence on the part of the accused that he or she is fit, legal representatives may reveal their doubts and the basis for those doubts to the trial judge. The question of unfitness can then be “raised … by the Court” within s5. 
     12   In the present case Newman J said: 
      
       
       “No suggestion was made of any lack of good faith on the part of either Mr Golding of counsel or Miss Evers, the solicitor for the accused”. 
       
     13   This finding was based on the fact that during the course of the argument before his Honour, the Crown Prosecutor said “counsel has raised the matter in good faith”. Although conduct by trial counsel may be relevant to the issue of good faith, this “concession” by the Crown was not necessarily determinative of the good faith of the Appellant. The question may not be raised in good faith “by a party” even though the party’s legal representatives are acting in perfectly good faith e.g. because they have been deceived by their client. 
     14   In any event, this is not a matter that can be determined by concession. The Court must reach a state of positive satisfaction that the issue has been “raised in good faith”, or else the statutory prohibition operates. The issue of “unfitness” falls outside the adversarial process of a criminal trial. (See Eastman v The Queen (supra) at [294] per Hayne J.) 
     15   In the present case, there may have been a basis for concluding that the Appellant was acting intentionally to derail the proceedings. On this appeal the Crown sought to support the trial on this basis. If his Honour had formed the view that the Appellant was acting in this way, then a finding that it did not “appear” to the Court that “the question of unfitness has been raised in good faith” would no doubt have been made. The Crown’s submission in this Court that “in effect” Newman J made such a finding should be rejected. His Honour did not address the statutory formulation in his reasons for judgment. 
     16   It may well be that in a particular case a second application based on identical or indistinguishable evidence will lead a court to fail to conclude that “the question has been raised in good faith”. That is not what happened here. His Honour posed a different and, in my opinion, impermissible, test i.e. whether the evidence was or would be “different” or “fresh”. 
     17   His Honour accepted that the question had been raised in good faith by the legal representatives. This was not, as I have indicated above, necessarily determinative. Nevertheless, his reasons suggest that it did appear to his Honour that the question had been raised in good faith “by the party” i.e. on his behalf. Accordingly, the statutory prohibition in s10(2) did not operate and, therefore, the mandatory terms of s10(1) did operate. 
     18   I agree with the orders proposed by Wood CJ at CL. 
     19   WOOD CJ AT CL: On 27 April 1999, the appellant appeared for trial in the Supreme Court at Wagga Wagga upon an indictment charging him with murder. On 19 May 1999, he was found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment for twenty-five years, with a minimum term fixed of eighteen years, each to commence from the date of his arrest, namely 28 March 1996. 
     20   Prior to appearing for trial an inquiry into his fitness was conducted before the trial Judge, Newman J and a jury. The jury in that inquiry, on 19 February 1999, found him fit to stand trial. To that hearing I will return. 
     21   The question of his possible unfitness was reventilated by his Counsel, before commencement of the trial, on 19 April 1999, and again on two separate occasions during the trial (on 28 April and 5 May 1999). In the circumstances later outlined, Newman J declined on each occasion to order a further fitness hearing. The appellant now appeals against the conviction on the grounds that the trial miscarried by reason of: 
      
       
      a) the fact that a real question arose at trial as to the appellant’s fitness which should have led to a further fitness hearing;  
       
       
      b) the inability of the appellant’s legal advisers to obtain instructions from him. 
       
       
      HISTORY OF THE PROCEEDINGS 
       
     22   The course which the defence of the proceedings took pre-trial and during the trial was the subject of evidence led by way of a lengthy affidavit from the appellant’s solicitor, Tania Evers. In addition, the court has the advantage of the transcript and of affidavits from the Crown Prosecutor and Counsel who appeared for the appellant at the trial.  
     23   In substance, this material reveals that Ms Evers first saw the appellant in about June 1996. After a conference of about one hour, she formed the view that she could not take proper instructions from him, as his answers were frequently non responsive and to her mind contradictory. As a consequence, she telephoned Professor Susan Hayes and requested that she assess his fitness to stand trial. 
     24   On 15 July 1996, the appellant appeared in the Local Court at Albury. A local Legal Aid solicitor, who gave him advice in relation to bail, was advised that he no longer wished her to appear for him. When he was subsequently spoken to about this he made it plain that he regarded her “sacking” as humorous. 
     25   Ms Evers next saw him in August 1996. Again she concluded that she was unable to obtain any sensible instructions as he continued to give what appeared to be contradictory answers and seemed unable to understand what she was saying to him, or to appreciate the purpose of the pending committal proceedings. 
     26   Immediately prior to the commencement of the committal hearing on 2 December 1996, he informed Ms Evers that she was sacked, and that he intended to appear for himself and to apply for bail. He did not seem to understand that witnesses had been required to attend who would need to be cross examined, asserting that he would “tell his story and get bail”. Notwithstanding his stated intention, Ms Evers attended the bail hearing and, with the encouragement of his support person, managed to persuade him that he needed legal representation.  
     27   During almost the entirety of the committal, the appellant slept, at times lying on his seat. When asked what was happening he responded, at times ‘I don’t know’, and at other times he would laugh and say, “I sleep”. 
     28   When discussing with him the evidence of one witness, Dennis Wheatley, which was considered to be of potential value to his case, he again made contradictory observations, indicating to Ms Evers that he did not understand the significance of the matter raised. 
     29   The committal was stood over part heard to 21 April 1997. Prior to that date, and again on 21 April, the appellant informed Ms Evers that she was sacked. He had, at that stage, been taken off his medication and appeared to be very agitated. Despite repeating his desire to represent himself, he eventually agreed, with apparent reluctance, that Ms Evers appear for him.  
     30   A fitness trial was later fixed at the direction of the Attorney General, pursuant to S8 (1) of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990, for 16 February 1998. In advance of the hearing Ms Bell SC (as she then was), Ms Evers and Ms Mulaney visited the appellant at Lithgow gaol. During the visit he observed that he “sacked (Ms Evers) all the time because he was angry and upset because lots of people are talking and he was going to court too many times.” He added that he found court boring so he slept a lot and he could not understand what was occurring. When asked what he expected would happen at the fitness hearing he said that the legal representatives talk and the police talk and “when the judge or police prosecutor says you’re innocent, then I walk.” 
     31   The fitness hearing for 16 February 1998 was vacated and refixed for 11 May 1998. When Ms Evers saw him that day and asked him what he understood the hearing was about, he said “guilty, not guilty”. When asked what had happened at the committal he said “don’t know really, hard, too hard.” When asking him about a potential issue in the trial, concerning whether or not he may have moved the body of the deceased, but had not been involved in a way that meant that he was a principal in the killing, he supplied answers indicating that he believed that this would still have amounted to murder. When asked about accidental killing, he replied that for this “you can get the death penalty”. 
     32   On other occasions when discussing with him what would be involved in the proof of his guilt of murder, he quoted advice said to have been given by prison officers or other prisoners, which indicated a lack of understanding of criminal liability of a principal or accessory, and a lack of appreciation of the proper role of his legal advisers. In those circumstances, Ms Evers said that she found it impossible to explore with him matters relevant to issues of mental illness and diminished responsibility. 
     33   The fitness hearing for 11 May 1998, was also vacated and refixed for 15 February 1999. 
     34   On 11 February 1999, just prior to the adjourned fitness hearing, Ms Evers inquired of the appellant as to whether he knew why they were to be in court. Although he acknowledged that the purpose of the hearing was to decide if he was fit to be tried, he said that he did not know what that meant, and added that he would probably be asleep like last time. Ms Evers asked him a number of questions directed towards gaining an appreciation of what would occur. His answers indicated at best a very superficial understanding of the purpose or nature of the proceeding, and particularly of his fitness, at one point volunteering that people have been talking about whether he is fit or not fit. He said “I’m fit, look at me, look how healthy and strong I am.” 
     35   The fitness hearing began on 15 February 1999 and concluded on 19 February 1999, with a finding that the appellant was fit for trial. During the hearing evidence was called from two forensic psychiatrists, Drs. Lucas and Westmore, and from a neuro-psychologist, Professor Suzanne Hayes. In addition, evidence was presented of the interviews with police in which the appellant had participated, and from his support person, in relation to the way in which he had been functioning in the community.  
     36   Dr Westmore acknowledged that the appellant was moderately disabled intellectually, but thought him fit to stand trial. It seems to have been his clear impression that the appellant was “independently minded”, and that he had been functioning in the community at a higher level than his psychological test results would suggest. He accepted that as a result, he might become bored during a trial and go to sleep or behave in a disruptive way. Otherwise, he took into account the fact that he had given police two accounts that were exculpatory of himself, although contradictory; and that he acknowledged having given an incorrect version to police. It was his opinion that he appeared to have an adequate understanding of the “Presser requirements”; that he had been able to function in the community in the sense of using public transport and operating a bank account; that he could attend and concentrate during an interview of one hour’s length; and that he did not display any sign of mental illness. 
     37   Professor Hayes gave evidence of her test results which rated him at the level of moderate intellectual disability, (at a level lower than 99.9% of the population) which placed him at an age of about four and a half years in the communication domain, at age of nine years and two months in the daily living skills domain, and at a level commensurate with his cognitive abilities in the socialisation domain. She said that it was her conclusion that while he was able to give answers which, at face value, would suggest a knowledge of the charge and trial procedure, when pursued in more depth it became evident that such understanding or knowledge as he had was too superficial and incomplete for him to qualify as fit to stand trial. As she put it: 
      
       
        
        “A. the impediment to the trial is the impediment of his understanding of what is going on and what evidence is being presented, and whether that evidence is consistent or not consistent with what he knows to be the case, whether he can respond to that evidence, whether his receptive language is sufficient that he can understand what other people are doing … whether he understands that some people are presenting evidence on his behalf or other people are presenting evidence which is opposed to him, so all of those things are relevant to his ability to participate effectively in his own defence.” 
        
       
     38   Dr. Lucas said that, based on the questions which he had put to the appellant concerning the charge and legal process, it was his opinion that the accused was unfit to stand trial. He said his intellectual disability was obvious. He thought that a number of his answers were inconsistent, and that his understanding of what was involved in the trial was incomplete and confused. His assessment was encapsulated in the following passage:  
      
       
        
        “Despite Mr Mailes’ increased knowledge of legal proceedings and related matters, I have serious doubts about his fitness to stand trial. His knowledge of legal proceedings and the personnel involved is minimal, at times contradictory, for example, about the role of a prosecutor, and I doubt whether he is intellectually able to make great use of the knowledge. He is aware of problems in following and comprehending legal proceedings and given his considerable degree of intellectual disability, lack of interpersonal skills and his limited knowledge, I have serious doubts as to whether he will be able to sufficiently understand what is happening in a trial and to operate adequately with his legal representatives. In short, his level of understanding of what is going on and his ability to participate in the presentation of his defence will be severely limited.” 
        
       
     39   Dr. Lucas noted that fitness is “very much … a today thing.. in that fitness is how you are at the time of your trial”. He indicated that any interview with police had to be looked at in its context, so far as he was being spoken to in a structured situation about things in his recent knowledge and of a concrete nature, whereas a determination as to fitness had to be made “looking at quite different things”. Additionally, he said that telling a story and changing it (as had occurred in this case where the appellant had initially provided an alibi when interviewed, and had then abandoned that in favour of a version in which he and the person who had carried out the offence had changed clothes), provided no great measure of intellectual capacity.  
     40   Dr. Lucas thought that the independence of mind which Dr. Westmore had noted, could rebound in the opposite direction, so far as it could lead to inappropriate behaviour, such as sending psychiatrists away and sacking legal representatives. Similarly, an ability to function in a basic way in the community, he said, did not mean that he could manage in court. 
     41   Ms Enid Hope, a support worker with the Department of Community Services who had known the appellant for some time and who acted as the appellant’s support person, gave evidence of his behavioural difficulties while a resident of the Woodstock Centre at Lavington. She confirmed that she had seen him sleeping during the committal hearing, and that he had said to her that he was bored and did not understand what was happening. 
     42   Ms Evers said that during the first two days of the fitness hearing, the appellant had appeared to be dozing on and off. By the third day, he fell into a deep sleep. When she gave evidence, however, he was alert. After she had done so, he was very hostile towards her and said that she was sacked. It appears that he had concluded from the fact that she had gone into the witness box, that she was working for the Crown, and wanted him locked up.  
     43   When he was visited by Ms Evers on 3 March 1999, with a view to obtaining instructions for the trial, he walked out of the room in anger, observing, “I don’t have to listen to this”. On 22 March 1999, by which time he had been transferred to the Long Bay Prison Hospital, the appellant gave her a note, written by someone on his behalf, again advising that he did not want her or counsel to help him any more in court and that they were both sacked. 
     44   After giving her this note, he retired to a cell. After being persuaded to come out, he emphasised that Ms Evers had hurt his feelings. Ms Evers attempted to discuss the matter with him, but once again it seemed to her that he was unable to appreciate the significance of the evidence which had been given at committal.  
     45   In March, Ms Evers sought the assistance of Professor Hayes in assessing the reliability of the ERISP. She also sought a copy of a report prepared by Ms Penhallurik, a speech pathologist and psychologist employed by the Department of Corrective Services, which, it was thought, could be relevant to issues relating to his comprehension. She received a message that the appellant had refused to give an authority for the release to her of this report, and that she had again been sacked. 
     46   On 6 April 1999, the appellant refused to come out of his cell to see Ms Evers. An attempt was made via the support person to persuade him to change his mind. When she spoke to him he refused to listen, giggled and said that he was going to represent himself. 
     47   On 9 April 1999, Ms Evers sent a letter to the appellant by fax, in effect noting his withdrawal of instructions, reminding him that his trial was only two and a half weeks off, and seeking his advice as to what he wanted her to do with the brief of evidence. Later that day, Ms Evers received a message from the gaol advising that the appellant did want her to represent him, and that he would see her on Sunday 11 April.  
     48   On that day she attended at the Long Bay Prison hospital with Mr. Terry Golding, of Counsel. She raised with the appellant the advisability of seeing Professor Hayes, but he refused to do so because “she was working for the Crown”. He added that all of the doctors were doing a job for the Crown and wanted him locked up. 
     49   In the course of questions by Mr. Golding, the appellant gave answers which appeared to convey very little understanding of what had occurred at the committal and at the fitness hearing or what might happen at the trial. By way of example are the following exchanges: 
      
       
      In relation to the committal 
       
       
        
        “Mr. Golding: What happened at the Albury Court?  
        
       
       
        
        Mr. Mailes: I slept, they drugged me right up. I can’t remember much. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Mr. Golding: Did the judge do anything? Mr. Mailes: He said thank you, you can go now. 
        
       
       
       
      In relation to the fitness hearing: 
       
       
        
        “Mr. Golding: What about when you went to the Sydney court?  
        
       
       
        
        Mr Mailes: The judge was all dressed up. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr. Golding: what did he look like?  
        
       
       
        
        Mr. Mailes: Like a person who comes out of a bottle. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr. Golding: what was the judge doing?  
        
       
       
        
        Mr. Mailes: He was listening in, fitness to plead, I reckon I am. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Mr. Golding: What did the Doctors say?  
        
       
       
        
        Mr. Mailes: I don’t know. I was given medication three times a day there. I try to stay awake and listen in … 
        
       
      Again in relation to the committal 
       
       
        
        Mr. Golding: Going back to Albury, what happened there. Could you understand what people said?  
        
       
       
        
        Mr. Mailes: No, people talk too quickly. I want to understand, they’re saying bad things about me. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Mr. Golding: Did you understand what they were saying?  
        
       
       
        
        Mr. Mailes: No. They asked hard questions, I couldn’t understand it. I’d remember if I heard it. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr. Golding: when you were in Albury, could you tell Tania if anything was wrong?  
        
       
       
        
        Mr. Mailes: No I couldn’t tell Tania because I couldn’t understand it. 
        
       
       
      Further in relation to the fitness hearing 
       
       
        
        Mr. Golding: In going back to the Sydney court, what was the jury doing?  
        
       
       
        
        Mr. Mailes: They were listening in. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr. Golding: Why were you there?  
        
       
       
        
         Mr. Mailes: I don’t know, fit to plead, for trial or not. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr. Golding: what does that mean?  
        
       
       
        
        Mr. Mailes: I don’t know 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Mr. Golding: what does unfit mean?  
        
       
       
        
        Mr. Mailes: Forensic patient, not guilty, mentally ill. 
        
       
       
        
        He then added: I don’t want to be a forensic patient, I want to go home.” 
        
       
       
      In relation to the pending trial 
       
       
        
        Mr. Golding: What do the doctors want to do. Do they like you? Mr. Mailes: No, they want to lock me up. If I’m made a forensic, I’ll be in for 3 years. 
        
       
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Mr. Golding: Do you want to talk to the judge?  
        
       
       
        
        Mr. Mailes: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr. Golding: What about the police prosecutor?  
        
       
       
        
        Mr. Mailes: No, he’ll ask me hard questions. I can’t understand the questions. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
       
        
        Mr. Mailes then said that they should bring back the death penalty. Mr. Golding asked him why and Mr. Mailes said ‘it’ll stop crime, it’ll stop rape, it’ll stop murder and stop rock spiders’. Mr. Golding said that ‘what if they get it wrong’, Mr. Mailes laughed and said something like ‘hadn’t thought about that.’  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Mr. Golding: What’ll the judge do?  
        
       
       
        
        Mr. Mailes: He says guilty or not guilty. 
        
       
       
        
        Then he described how the judge hits the table with a hammer and says ‘lock him up’. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr. Golding: Does the judge do anything else?  
        
       
       
        
        Mr. Mailes: He has meetings with the police prosecutor at morning tea and lunch time and talks to them to see if I’m guilty or not guilty. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr. Golding: How’ll the judge know if you’re guilty or not guilty?  
        
       
       
        
        Mr. Mailes: I don’t know, guess I guess. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr. Mailes then added: He’ll try to work it out. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr. Golding: What about the jury?  
        
       
       
        
        Mr. Mailes: They take a rough guess. 
        
       
     50   When Mr. Golding attempted to obtain instructions on some of the matters raised in the Crown brief the appellant replied that the questions being asked were “too hard”. At the end of the interview he remained firm that he would not let Professor Hayes see him, as she was working for the Crown. 
     51   On 19 April 1999, Mr. Golding again raised with Newman J, in Sydney, the issue of the appellant’s fitness to stand trial, indicating that it had recently been learned that he had been seeing a treating psychiatrist over the preceding twelve months, and that a conference had been arranged with that psychiatrist (Dr. O’Dea) which may lead to an application to reopen the issue. Further consideration of the matter was deferred. 
     52   On 27 April, the trial began in Wagga Wagga. Following the Crown opening, Mr. Golding and Ms Evers spoke to the appellant in the cells. It was explained that there were some things that he had to know in relation to the law. Ms Evers considered that he seemed to regard this discussion as humorous.  
     53   He seemed unable to understand an explanation that was given in relation to the significance of the lies, which it was asserted that he had told to police, or the explanations which were given in relation to diminished responsibility, mental illness, and the implications of being made a forensic patient. In the course of the discussion concerning these issues he indicated that he would not give evidence because it was embarrassing due to his inability to talk properly. 
     54   He also indicated, by his answers, that he had not understood what had been said by the Prosecution during the Crown opening, and that he could not understand him. He also indicated that he could not hear properly. At the end of the day Mr. Golding informed the trial Judge that the concerns which had been raised in Sydney on 19 April, had not been resolved, and that he was still unable to obtain instructions in relation to significant matters.  
     55   On 28 April at 2pm Mr. Golding formally raised the issue of fitness with the trial Judge, and sought a fitness inquiry. This was rejected and the trial proceeded. An application for a stay to allow the matter to be tested in the Court of Criminal Appeal was refused, and the hearing resumed. To this application and to the reasons for its refusal, I shall return. 
     56   Thereafter, and for much of the trial, the appellant behaved in a totally bizarre and inappropriate fashion, to such a degree that for the following two days a diary note was kept, by Ms Evers’ assistant, of his behaviour. 
     57   It is not necessary to go into the detail of the many incidents which occurred save to note, in a summary way, that on this day, in an almost continuous way, the applicant yawned loudly, swayed, rocked backwards and forwards in his seat, looked back at the gallery and grinned at those present, passed wind loudly and repetitively, made a variety of snorting, choking, singing, growling, and quacking noises, and laughed. At one stage when Detective Smart answered a question in the affirmative, he rose to his feet, yelled out “yep”, and turned around looking at those in Court with a grin. When Newman J adjourned the proceedings at the end of the day he stood rigidly to attention and saluted. 
     58   On 29 April the appellant continued to behave in the same bizarre and disruptive fashion, causing the trial judge to warn him that he risked being charged with contempt and locked up unless he desisted. When Ms Evers spoke to him about this warning the applicant appeared not to appreciate what was being said, instead indicated that he believed the judge had concluded he was guilty of the murder.  
     59   During the day the applicant swore repeatedly and made offensive gestures and threatening remarks to his Honour, at times while his Honour was speaking to the jury and at other times while evidence was being given. Throughout the day he burped, whistled, sang, yawned, blew raspberries, quacked, spat in the dock, laughed, and made jocular comments while crime scene videos were being shown. His behaviour, however, improved to a degree when his support person was allowed to sit with him and to supply him with lollies. 
     60   On 30 April the applicant’s bizarre behaviour resumed. At various times he threw crayons and lollies or their wrappers around the Court, his targets included the Crown prosecutor and his own Counsel. Otherwise, he continued to swear, to make noises, to sing, and to make bird noises and offensive gestures. He also imitated witnesses and Court officers, and threatened to fight one witness. 
     61   On 3 May the appellant began proceedings by knocking on the walls of the dock, causing those present to rise, much to his amusement. Thereafter he copied answers from the witnesses and sometimes volunteered his own answers. Otherwise his singing, insulting and abusive language and gestures and peculiar noises continued. At one stage he commenced to do push ups and squats in the dock. At various times he told the trial Judge that he was a ‘shit’ or a ‘rockspider’ or ‘a wanker’. He also spent much of the day talking loudly about golf balls, laughing and interrupting witnesses. He appeared to become more aggressive as the day progressed, particularly towards Det Hayes and the Crown Prosecutor, having to be restrained when he lunged at the latter. At one stage his Honour noted that his conduct was “starting to affect the conduct of the trial,” and cautioned him that if he persisted in this way he may have to be restrained. 
     62   On 4th May, it would appear, the appellant remained relatively quiet, non disruptive, and awake. 
     63   On 5th May, however, the appellant resumed singing and making other noises during the playing of the ERISP. At the short adjournment his Honour warned him that if he sought to disrupt the trial deliberately he would waive his right to be present. When the trial resumed his disruptive behaviour continued unabated. An application was made by the Crown for him to be removed at least during the playing of the video of the ERISP. 
     64   Mr. Golding, in the absence of the jury, again raised the question of the applicant’s fitness to be tried, pointing out that he was effectively uninstructed. In this respect, he noted that Dr. Westmore had been provided with information as to the way in which the trial was progressing. Dr. Westmore’s opinion, it was reported, remained unchanged upon the basis that the appellant was selectively directing his vituperation towards the trial Judge and the Crown Prosecutor, or at least principally towards them. 
     65   Mr. Golding also pointed out the impossible task he would have of obtaining instructions if the appellant were removed from Court, having regard to his inability to read or write. In this regard, it was his submission that the appellant was not deliberately obstructing the proceedings, rather, he argued, that they were totally opaque to him and all that he was doing was alleviating his boredom. The possibility was also raised of there being some imbalance in his medication.  
     66   As subsequent enquiry has revealed, there was some force in that suggestion. Prison Medical Records indicate that the appellant was not given his medication (Valium) between 27 April and 3 May, or on 5 or 6 May. Subsequently, the records suggest that he was medicated, at least until 12 May. 
     67   The application for a fitness hearing was again refused upon the basis that nothing new had been shown. The application of the Crown was, however, allowed, and an order was made that the appellant be excluded from the courtroom during this phase of the evidence. In making that order, his Honour found that the appellant was trying deliberately to obstruct the proceedings by “his unseemly and outrageous behaviour”. 
     68   When the applicant was spoken to in the cells, over the luncheon adjournment, he did not seem to understand what had happened, or why he was being excluded. When the situation was explained to him by Counsel he responded by with withdrawing his instructions, and said that he would conduct the trial himself. When proceedings resumed, Mr. Golding informed the trial judge of these developments. While that happened a message was received from a Corrective Services Officer that the applicant was ‘going bananas’ in the CCTV room where he was listening to the proceedings. 
     69   At that point, a question having arisen as to whether Counsel had instructions to continue, the hearing was adjourned so that appropriate advice could be received from the Bar Council, and possibly from the Guardianship Tribunal. Mr. Golding made it clear that he thought the appellant incapable of knowing what he was doing, and did not know whether his retainer had been effectively withdrawn. 
     70   On 6 May the question of representation was considered. When his Honour asked the appellant whether he was still instructing Mr. Golding and Ms Evers, he gave conflicting answers, but when pressed further, he indicated that it did “not worry” him if they appeared for him. He was informed by his Honour that if he was prepared to be quiet he could remain in the courtroom, otherwise he would be excluded. He indicated that he found it too hard to be quiet and said that he wanted to go back to the Junee Corrections Centre. That was refused, and he was required to remain in the cells during the remainder of the playing of the ERISP. At the end of the day he threatened to ‘neck himself’. The Prison Medical Service was warned and an assurance was given that a check would be made as to whether he was taking his medication.  
     71   On 7 May the appellant informed Mr. Golding and Ms Evers that he would be a “good boy”, and that he wished to be back in court. His Honour obtained an assurance from him that he would be quiet. He was allowed to return to the dock and he then spent much of the day asleep. When awake he remained quiet. This, it may be noted, was a day for which an entry concerning the supply of medication appeared in the prison health records, whereas there was no such entry for the previous two tumultuous days. 
     72   For the remainder of the trial until 19 May, the appellant remained fairly subdued, sleeping at times although not as consistently as during the committal and fitness hearings. On one occasion, however, he became uncontrollable and declined to leave his cell after the luncheon adjournment. This followed his aunt giving evidence.  
     73   On 25 May when Ms Evers spoke to the appellant at Long Bay Prison Hospital, following his conviction, he said “this is serious isn’t it?” He added “I want to tell you what happened” - going on to explain that he had touched the victim’s body to see whether she was alive, and that he had then helped the killer to move the body. When asked why he had not disclosed this before the trial, he said “I thought that was murder”.  
     74   An affidavit was provided by Mr. Golding confirming Ms Evers’ account of the events leading up to and during the trial. It was his assessment, that he had been unable to obtain instructions from him. 
     75   Mr. Paul Conlon, the Deputy Senior Crown Prosecutor who appeared for the Crown at the trial, agreed that the appellant had behaved disruptively during the trial. However, he noted that at times he had appeared to be prompting Miss Evers’ assistant to note down instances of his misbehaviour, and that when he had been allowed back into Court from 7 May (that being the date from which it would appear that he was regularly medicated), he had not displayed any further significant disruptive behaviour. He acknowledged that at times the appellant had been asleep, but on other occasions, he said, he appeared to be feigning sleep. 
     76   Dr. Lucas provided a further report after the trial in which he expressed the opinion that the appellant’s disruptive behaviour had probably not been aimed at thwarting the legal process: 
      
       
        
        “It was more likely due to boredom, an inability to make full sense of (the) proceedings, and … being unable to adequately engage in them.” 
        
       
     77   He saw no reason to change his original opinion that the appellant had been unfit to stand trial, and he thought that his unfitness was permanent. His opinion is encapsulated in the following passages of his report: 
      
       
        
        “It is my opinion that during his trial Mr. Mailes’ behaviour indicated that he could not adequately participate in proceedings, was unable to follow them in a meaningful way and did not appreciate how his conduct might affect how he was viewed by members of the jury. When his medication was changed his ability to participate was further reduced by drowsiness and sleeping. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        The events which occurred during his trial: disruptive behaviour, sacking of legal representative and inability to instruct, were largely predictable on the basis of his intellectual and communication deficits and previous conduct. His behaviour at trial was more extreme than one might have predicted, probably because he was more sedated during his fitness hearing. However sedation has its own risks in that it induces drowsiness and sleep, further reducing Mr. Mailes’ ability to participate meaningfully in legal proceedings. 
        
       
     78   It is convenient to return to the two applications which were made during the trial for the fitness issue to be reventilated.  
      
       
      Application of 28 May  
       
     79   A report from Dr. O’Dea was tendered on 28 April, in which he recorded that he had been in charge of the appellant’s four admissions to the Long Bay Prison Hospital complex between May 1997 and March 1999. These admissions had resulted from the significant behavioural problems which had been observed.  
     80   His opinion was as follows: 
      
       
        
        “7. I do not consider that Mr. Mailes is fit from a psychiatric perspective to stand trial.  
        
       
       
        
        8. It is my view that he has ongoing significant problems with his understanding of the court process and the roles of various agents including himself in that process, and the nature and implications of his various pleas, as outlined in the “Presser Criteria”. Although he has been consistently able to give glib and superficial answers to direct questions about these matters, he conveys no sense of even a rudimentary functional understanding of them. In addition, he has been unable to show a significant increase in general knowledge about these criteria despite frequent discussion and information about them. 
        
       
       
        
        9. From my dealings in his case he is likely to have major difficulties in following the evidence in the case and instructing counsel accordingly. I am aware of the difficulties in gaining and maintaining sensible instructions from Mr Mailes. At interview on 21 April 1999, Mr. Mailes was candid in clearly conceding that he had no idea what has gone on in court to date and gets bored and falls asleep when in court. 
        
       
       
        
        10. Mr. Mailes has had, and is likely to continue to have specific difficulties being able to cope with the stress of the court process. He has continually requested medication to help him cope with court appearances and has become increasingly distressed in the lead up to court appearances. It is of note that he has displayed marked deterioration in his behaviour when under stress in the prison system and that at these times he has required admission to the Long Bay Prison Hospital Complex in a highly aroused and disorganised state. 
        
       
       
        
        11. The above problems with his fitness to be tried appear directly related to his intellectual impairment. 
        
       
       
        
        12. It is not anticipated that he would become fit to be tried in the near future.” 
        
       
       
      Application of 5 May 
       
     81   The application was also supported by an affidavit from Ms Evers which substantially recited the various incidents between 15 July 1996 and 12 April 1999 previously noted. Annexed to it was a copy of the report from Ms Penhallurick. She noted the extent of the appellant’s sensori-neural deafness, which she said was likely to cause him to hear sounds only as muffled, to have difficulties in discriminating among sounds, and to be erratic and fluctuating in his capacity to hear. It also noted the relatively severe communication difficulties which he had associated with his intellectual disability, his incompletely repaired cleft palate and hair lip, and his hearing deficit. 
     82   No additional evidence was presented in a formal sense, although Mr. Golding recounted from the Bar table his concerns in relation to the appellant’s fitness to plead. These included the fact that the conferences with him had been able to proceed only at a rudimentary level; that the applicant’s attention span was insufficient for an extended or exhaustive conference; that attempts to take instructions in relation to mental state issues invariably met with the response that their retainer had been with withdrawn that it was impossible to discuss with the appellant tactical issues or to obtain instructions of the kind needed for a decision whether or not to call him to give evidence; and that his questioning of the appellant as to what had occurred on the first day of the trial had suggested that his understanding was “totally opaque”. 
     83   Counsel submitted that Dr. O’Dea’s greater familiarity with the appellant, gave him a greater insight and ability to express an opinion as to his fitness than was available to Drs. Lucas and Westmore. 
     84   Counsel concluded the submission by observing: 
      
       
        
        “His legal representatives’ concerns and beliefs are that he simply has no idea of what is happening in Court.” 
        
       
       
      Later he observed: 
       
       
        
        “…. I am telling your Honour that I cannot get instructions from him and I say that in good faith”. 
        
       
     85   The Crown opposed the application on the basis that the issue had been determined in February 1999, and that in order for a further hearing to be directed, the trial judge “would have to be satisfied that there is now available some fairly compelling evidence on the issue which was not able to be brought before the jury (at the earlier fitness hearing).” That evidence, it was submitted, was lacking.  
     86   Responsibly and fairly, however, the Crown Prosecutor accepted that he had “not stood up and said that the application is not made in good faith”, adding “I am totally unable to say that”.  
     87   In dismissing the application, his Honour found that the evidence which Mr. Golding now sought to adduce was of the same kind as that placed before the earlier hearing. His Honour dealt with the submission of Mr. Golding, to the effect that the issue having been raised, and there being no question of mala fides, an inquiry had to be ordered, as follows: 
      
       
        
        “Section 10(1) is disjunctive in that it gives two instances where an inquiry can be raised: (a) where the Attorney-General determines that an inquiry should be conducted, or (b) the question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for the offence is raised after the person is arraigned on a charge in respect of (an) offence. 
        
       
       
        
        The question, in fact, was raised before the accused was arraigned. An inquiry was duly held. If it be that the nature of the matters raised relating to the question of unfitness to be tried was different on an application such as the present, I would regard that as being a  
        fresh application 
        .  
        In other words 
        ,  
        an application falling within section 10(1)(b) 
        , but where the evidence which is sought to be adduced in the prospective inquiry is, in nature, no different from that which was raised before, albeit evidence coming from different witnesses, I am of the view that in those circumstances, it not being a matter going to a new inquiry, all that is being sought, it seems to me, is to reventilate a matter which has already been determined pursuant to an  
        inquiry arising under section 10(1) (a). 
        
       
       
        
        In these circumstances, I am of the view that a fresh inquiry should not be conducted and I rule accordingly.” 
        
       
     88   It may be observed that, to this point in the proceeding the appellant had not been behaving in the disruptive and offensive manner which characterised the proceedings over the following days, and which led to the next application on 5th May. That later application was somewhat different, so far as it also needed to be considered in the context of the realistic possibility that the appellant would have to be excluded from the Courtroom, or sedated. 
     89   On this occasion, his Honour, in dismissing the application, observed that there was no other matter which Counsel could put before him which was “fresh … fresh in the sense that it means that some change has occurred.” The application was accordingly dismissed “for the type of reasons” given on 28 April. His Honour did not, in relation to this application, deal with the question of good faith. However, it is clear, from the reasons given in relation to the application by the Crown for the appellant to be removed from the Courtroom, that he had come to the conclusion that he was deliberately obstructing the proceedings. 
     90   In the light of that extensive review of the somewhat extraordinary and difficult course which the trial took, I turn to the grounds of appeal, which as I have already observed, are closely related. The appeal commenced, in a sense, where the trial had left of, so far as Mr. Game SC for the appellant observed that, while he did not think that he and his instructing solicitor had instructions from the appellant in “the normal sense”, they believed that they had instructions “in some general sense” to conduct the appeal. The appellant was present while the matter was heard. He did not indicate any view one way or the other as to whether he wished the matter to proceed. He remained quiet and well behaved, but gave no indication as to whether he was listening to the argument, or whether he had any comprehension of what was occurring. I am prepared to assume, in the circumstance outlined, that the appeal was instituted and pursued with his general authority. 
      
       
      Refusal to order a further fitness hearing 
       
     91   The submission advanced by the appellant in this respect was simple, namely that the question of fitness having been raised by Mr. Golding in good faith, as the Crown Prosecutor had conceded, there should have been a further fitness hearing on 28 April, or if not then, on 5 May. Put another way, it was submitted that his Honour addressed the wrong question, in so far as he appears to have assumed that unless some new material had been placed before him, additional to that led on the original fitness hearing, then all that was being sought was a reventilation of the S10 (1)(a) inquiry, and not a S10 (1)(b) inquiry.  
      
       
      The current Legislation in New South Wales 
       
     92   The circumstances in which a Court is required to hold a “Fitness hearing” are defined in the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (“the Procedure Act”). Of immediate relevance are the following provisions: 
      
       
        
        “5: The question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for an offence may be raised by any party to the proceedings in respect of the offence or by the Court. 
        
       
       
        
        7. (1) The question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for an offence is, so far as practicable, to be raised before the person is arraigned on a charge in respect of the offence but may be raised at any time during the course of the hearing of the proceedings in respect of the offence. 
        
       
       
        
         (2) Nothing in this section prevents the question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for an offence from being raised on more than one occasion in respect of the same proceedings. 
        
       
       
        
        8. (1) If the question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for an offence is raised at any time before the person is arraigned on a charge in respect of the offence, the Attorney General must determine whether an inquiry should be conducted before the hearing of the proceedings in respect of the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        10. (1) If, in respect of an offence: 
        
       
       
        
         (a) the Attorney General determines that an inquiry should be conducted and does not subsequently determine, before the inquiry is commenced, that there is no longer any need for such an inquiry to be conducted; or 
        
       
       
        
         (b) the question of person’s unfitness to be tried for the offence is raised after the person is arraigned on a charge in respect of the offence, 
        
       
       
        
        the Court  
        must 
         (except as provided by this section), as soon as practicable after the Attorney General’s determination is made or the question is raised, as the case may be, conduct an inquiry in order to determine whether the person is unfit to be tried for the offence; 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The Court must not conduct an inquiry into the question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for an offence  
        unless 
         it appears to the Court that the question has been raised  
        in good faith 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        15. It is to be presumed: 
        
       
       
        
        a) that a person who has, in accordance with this Part, been found to be unfit to be tried for an offence continues to be unfit to be tried for the offence until the contrary is, on the balance of probabilities, determined to be the case. 
        
       
       
       
        
        b) that a person who has, in accordance with this part, been found fit to be tried for an offence continues to be fit to be tried for the offence until the contrary is, on the balance of probabilities, determined to be the case. 
        
       
     93   These provisions take their place within an Act which bears the long title “An Act with respect to criminal proceedings involving persons affected by mental illness and other mental conditions”; and within a Part (Part 2) headed “Criminal Proceedings in the Supreme Court and District Court Relating to Persons Affected by Mental Disorders” (the emphases are mine). 
     94   The Procedure Act is linked to the Mental Health Act 1990, (“the Health Act”) so far as persons who are found unfit, or who become the subject of a special hearing, in accordance with Sections 18 to 21 of the Procedure Act, become “forensic patients”, who then fall within the application of Chapter 5 of the Health Act. In each case such persons are subject to review and assessment by the Mental Health Review Tribunal, (“the Tribunal”) a tribunal constituted under the Health Act. 
      
       
      Scope of the Act 
       
     95   An issue of some importance arises in this context, which seems to have been assumed at trial, and which was not initially addressed in this appeal. It concerns the question of whether an accused who is intellectually disabled ie developmentally disabled, but who does not suffer a mental illness within DSM IV or within the colloquial meaning of that expression, can qualify for a fitness hearing under the Procedure Act. Although the question which arises in this appeal relates specifically to a person with a congenital or developmental disability, it applies equally to a person whose disability is of a cognitive kind that was caused by accident or physical disease, and is unrelated to mental illness. 
     96   By reason of the fact that this appeared to the Court to be a potentially live but unaddressed issue after it had reserved its decision, further submissions were sought from Counsel. That it is a live issue, arises from the circumstance that all three psychiatrists who examined the appellant described his condition as one involving a “moderate intellectual disability” associated with a “communication deficit of a relatively severe degree”, and said that he did not suffer from a mental illness. 
     97   Returning to the legislation, it may be noted that the Procedure Act, does not provide any definition of the expressions “mental illness” or “mental disorders” which appear respectively in the long title to that Act, and in the heading to Part 2. 
     98   The expression “mental condition” included in the long title is, however, defined in S3 of that Act, as is the expression “forensic patient”. This Section provides: 
      
       
        
        “ 
        mental condition”  
        means a disability of mind  
        not including 
         either mental illness or  
        developmental disability 
         of mind” 
        
       
       
        
         while  
        “forensic patient 
        ” has the same meaning as in the Mental Health Act 1990. 
        
       
       
      The definition given of a “forensic person” under the Health Act, as provided by Section 3, and the Dictionary contained in Schedule 1, includes: 
       
       
        
        “a) a person who is detained in a hospital, prison or other place pursuant to an order under S10 (3)(c) 14, 17(3), 25, 27 or 39 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 or Section 7(4) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (including the subsection as applied by Section 5AA(5) of the Act”. 
        
       
     99   To complete the legislative definition of terms, having a possible relevance to the issue which arises, it may be noted that the Health Act defines each of the expressions “mental illness” and “mental disorder” in Schedule 1, in ways which do not appear to include the intellectually disabled: 
      
       
        
        “’ 
        mental illness’  
         means a condition which seriously impairs, either temporarily or permanently, the mental functioning of a person  
        and 
         is characterised by the presence in the person of any one or more of the following symptoms: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          a) delusions 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          b) hallucinations 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          c) serious disorder of thought form 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          d) a severe disturbance of mood 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          e) sustained or repeated irrational behaviour indicating the presence of any one of more of the symptoms referred to in paragraphs (a)-(d). 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        ‘ 
        mentally disordered person 
        ’ for the purposes of this Act set out in  
        section 8 
         (which contains the criteria for involuntary admission or detention in a hospital) means a person who satisfies the relevant criteria set out in Chapter 3. 
        
       
     100   S11 of the Act (which is also contained within Chapter 3) provides that: 
      
       
        
        “(i) a person is not a mentally ill person or a  
        mentally disordered person 
         merely because of any one or more of the following: 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (j) that the person has  
        developmental disability of mind 
        ”. 
        
       
     101   It may be noted that the long title of the Health Act is “an Act to make provision with respect to the care, treatment and control of mentally ill and mentally disordered persons and other matters relating to mental health”.  
     102   Next, it is to be noted that Part 3 of the Procedure Act, headed “Summary Proceedings before a Magistrate relating to Persons Affected by Mental Disorders” employs the same terms, (in the italicised portion of the heading), as those appearing in the heading to Part 2. However, the operative, or empowering Section for that Part (S 32) expressly recognises three categories of persons, as falling within its reach, namely a person who is “developmentally disabled”, a person who is “suffering from mental illness”, and a person who is “suffering from a mental condition for which treatment is available in a hospital, but is not a mentally ill person within the meaning of Chapter 3 of the Mental Health Act 1990.” 
     103   The manner in which the cognate legislation has been framed in New South Wales invites the question whether, as a matter of statutory interpretation, it has had the unexpected and no doubt unintentional result of excluding from its reach, persons suffering from a “developmental disability of mind.”  
      
       
     104   So far as any ambiguity arises in relation to the reach of Part 2 of the Procedure Act, I observe that, in accordance with authority, it is permissible to have regard to the long title so as to resolve any ambiguity: Pitt Son & Badgery Ltd v Sydney Municipal Council (1908) 24 WN 203 at 204 per Street J; Birch v Allen (1942) 65 CLR 621 at 625-6 per Latham CJ; R v Bracknell Justices; Exparte Griffiths (1975) 2 All ER 881; Amatek Ltd v Googoorewon Pty Ltd (1993) 176 CLR 471 at 477, and Northern Suburbs General Cemetery Reserve Trust v The Commonwealth (1993) 176 CLR 555 at 563.  
     105   Similar principles apply to headings to Parts which can constrain the scope of a section contained within that Part where an ambiguity arises: Silk Bros Pty Ltd v State Electricity Commission (Vic) (1943) 67 CLR 1 at 16 per Latham CJ; Concrete Constructions (NSW) Pty Ltd v Nelson (1990) 169 CLR 209 - see also the summary of the relevant principles succinctly given by Murray CJ in Ragless v Prospect District Council [1922] SASR 299 at 311. 
     106   Additionally, the purposive approach to statutory interpretation needs to be borne in mind when an ambiguity arises or where it is necessary to determine whether more than one interpretation is open: Mills v Meeking (1990) 169 CLR 214; and Saraswati v The Queen (1991) 172 CLR 1: See also S 33 Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW). 
     107   In this regard it is also trite law that it is open to have regard to the historical setting of the Statute in order to identify the object of the legislature: Pambula District Hospital v Herriman (1988) 14 NSWLR 387 at 394 and 410; as well as to the second reading speech and other relevant extrinsic materials: S 34 of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW), ie subject to the constraints recognised in decisions such as Re Australian Federation of Construction Contractors: Ex parte Billing (1986) 68 ALR 416; The Ombudsman v Commissioner of Police (1987) 11 NSWLR 386 at 396; Estate of Masters; Hill v Plummer (1994) 33 NSWLR 446 at 450 to 452; R Bolton re Beane ex parte (1987) 162 CLR 514 at 517 to 518 and Brennan v Comcare (1994) 122 ALR 615. 
     108   Finally, in relation to relevant principles of statutory interpretation, it is the case that where one or more Acts form a scheme of legislation, as in my view the Health Act and the Procedure Act do, it is proper to have regard to each of them for the purpose of construing expressions used in any one of them: Commissioner of Stamp Duties v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd (1987) 9 NSWLR 719 at 723 per Kirby P. Particularly is that appropriate where the Bills for the two Acts were introduced together and assented to on the same day, or where they have progressed in tandem: Trade Practices Commissioner v Collings Construction Co Pty Ltd (1994) 130 ALR 115. In the present cases the two Acts in question were each assented to on 1 June 1990 and commenced on 3 September 1990. 
     109   So far as the researches of Counsel and of the Court have revealed the issue posed has not been the subject of consideration in this State, although the decision of Dunford J in DMA (2000) NSWSC 1051, a case with significant similarities, came close to dealing with it. The accused in that case had a similar full scale IQ to that of the present appellant, and expert psychiatric evidence was called to the effect that her fitness to be tried was significantly limited by that disability. However, there was also evidence to the effect that she had been diagnosed as having a conduct disorder, a dissociative disorder, an intermittent explosive disorder, as well as being psychotic and having a condition “consistent with schizophrenia”.  
     110   Although the intellectual deficit, the destractibility of the accused, and the difficulties which she was considered to have in following the proceedings, and in giving meaningful instructions, were the reason for the finding of unfitness by Dunford J, who decided the issue sitting without a jury, there was also evidence available as to the presence of a mental illness in the strict sense. 
     111   It is, in the circumstances outlined, necessary to revert to some of the history in relation to the manner in which the common law, and legislation have dealt with the question of fitness.  
      
      DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMMON LAW 
       
       
      The United Kingdom - origin of the rule 
       
     112   The origin of the rule concerning the fitness of an accused to stand trial appears to lie in the procedural formalities of the medieval courts of law. Without an opening plea and the accused’s consent to trial by jury, a trial could not take place. Accordingly, it became the practice for the Courts to determine whether a failure of a defendant to enter a plea was due to malice, or whether he or she was mute by the visitation of God. A critical distinction was drawn between these two classes of accused persons. Until 1772, a defendant who stood mute of malice was subjected to peine forte et dure, while in the case of an accused who was mute by visitation of God, a plea of not guilty was entered and the trial was respited.  
     113   Between 1772 (12 Geo 111 C 2) and 1827 (Criminal Law Act 1827 (UK)), a plea of guilty was recorded in relation to an accused found by jury to have stood mute of malice. After 1827 the Court was permitted to order the entry of a plea of not guilty in such a case.  
     114   The importance of comprehension (or lack of it) for a fair trial was early recognised. Sir Mathew Hale recorded: 
      
       
        
         “If a man in his found memory commits a capital offence, and before his arraignment he becomes absolutely mad, he ought not by law to be arraigned during such his [f]renzy, but be remitted to prison until that incapacity be removed; the reason is, because he cannot advisedly plead to the indictment …. And if such person after his plea, and before his trial, become of non sane memory, he shall not be tried; or, if after his trial he become of non sane memory, he shall not receive judgment; or, if after judgment he become of non sane memory, his execution shall be spared; for were he of sound memory, he might allege somewhat in stay of judgment or execution. 
        
       
       
        
        But because there may be great fraud in this matter, yet if the crime be notorious, as treason or murder, the judge before such a trial or judgment may do well to impanel a jury to inquire ex officio touching such insanity, and whether it be real or counterfeit. 
        
       
       
        
        If a person of non sane memory commit homicide during such his insanity, and continue so till the time of his arraignment, such person shall neither be arraigned nor tried, but remitted to gaol, there to remain in expectation of the king’s grace to pardon him”. (Hale, The History of the Pleas of the Crown 1736 Vol 1 at pp 34-5).  
        
       
     115   In the early cases three types of individuals became closely linked: the insane, the deaf mute and the individual who decided it was not in his best interests to plead. (Grubin D: “What constitutes fitness to plead?” [1993] Criminal Law Review 748 at 750). The deaf mute and the insane defendant, however, presented different problems for the Courts. 
     116   Although a trial could take place where the accused was deaf, based upon the not guilty plea, there was concern that it may not be appropriate to carry on with the proceedings. Many deaf mutes would not have been able to communicate effectively and they may have appeared to the Courts as if they were mentally defective. Hale wrote that the deaf-mute defendant was: 
      
       
        
        “….in presumption of law an ideot, and that rather, because he hath no possibility to understand what is forbidden by law to be done, or under what penalties: but it can appear, that he hath the use of understanding which many of that condition discover by signs to a very great measure, then he may be tried, and suffer judgment and execution; tho great caution is to be used therein.” (Hale:  
        The History of the Pleas of the Crown, Vol 1 p 34. 
        
       
     117   Consequently, the trial of the deaf-mute could take place, but only if the court exercised care to ensure that he or she was not mentally defective. If the defendant was found to be mentally defective, then he or she could not be tried. Before a deaf-mute could be properly tried, the jury was accordingly required to consider whether the muteness was genuine, and to make a decision about his or her mental ability.  
     118   In the case of the insane defendant, who was either mute in respect of his plea or could not plead sensibly, only the first of these steps had to be taken. The question was not one of mental ability, but whether or not the madness was real. If it was, trial was postponed pending recovery. 
     119   In the case of Frith for High Treason (1790) Howell’s State Trials Vol 22 (1783-1794) the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Kenyon informed the jury, which had been empanelled to determine whether the accused was ‘in a fit situation to plead”: 
      
       
        
        “… the humanity of the law of England falling into that which common humanity, without any written law would suggest, has prescribed that no man shall be called upon to make his defence at a time when his mind is in that situation as not to appear capable of so doing; for, however guilty he may be, the inquiring into his guilt must be postponed to that season, when by collecting together his intellects, and having them entire, he shall be able so to model his defence as to ward off the punishment of the law.” 
        
       
     120   However, it appears that this early distinction became somewhat blurred, one commentator observing: 
      
       
        
        “…. prior to  
        Dyson 
         and  
        Pritchard 
        , a clear distinction was made between defendants who were mentally defective and those who were insane in respect of their fitness to plead. Neither was in a position to have a fair trial; in the former case, trial should not take place as the accused did not have the faculty to understand what was going on, while in the latter the trial should be postponed, not cancelled, because the accused was temporarily unable to use whatever faculties he did have to defend himself adequately. This critical distinction, established by Hale and Keynon was lost in  
        Dyson  
        and  
        Pritchard  
        and has yet to be recovered.” (Grubin D: “ 
        What constitutes fitness to plead?” [1993] Criminal Law Review 748 
         at 751). 
        
       
      
      
      To these two decisions, I next turn.  
       
     121   In R v Dyson (1831) 7 C & P, 305 the defendant was a deaf mute. She was indicted in 1831 for the murder of her child. After hearing evidence that the defendant had always been deaf and dumb, the jury found her mute by the visitation of God. By making signs to a witness who was acquainted with her, she was, however, able to deny the charges. A plea of not guilty was recorded, but it proved impossible for her to understand the more complex procedure of challenging jurors. One witness gave evidence that he had instructed her in the dumb alphabet, but she was not advanced enough to make words. He swore that although she was incapable of understanding the nature of the proceedings, he had no doubt that in time she might be taught the means to do so.  
     122   Parke J, relied upon Hale’s previous statement of law and directed the jury that: 
      
       
        
        “….if they were satisfied that the prisoner had not then, from the defect of her faculties, intelligence enough to understand the nature of the proceedings against her they ought to find her  
        not sane 
        .”  
        
       
     123   The jury was satisfied that she could not understand the proceedings and she was subsequently declared insane. She was detained under the Criminal Lunatics Act 1800 at her Majesty’s pleasure. This case accordingly set two crucial precedents: firstly, in that it brought “idiocy” under the umbrella of insanity by finding that those found unfit to plead were “not sane”; and secondly, in establishing intelligence and ability to communicate, as the foundation upon which decisions about fitness to plead were to be made.  
     124   The linkage, which was made between idiocy and insanity, however, involved something of a misconstruction of Hale. In the passage quoted to the jury, Hale was referring to the madman in his temporary phrenzy, not “the ideot” with a permanent impossibility of understanding. For Hale and Kenyon “the ideot” and “the madman” were distinct, requiring separate tests in relation to their fitness for trial. Cognitive ability was important for the former, but for the latter the issue was whether or not the insanity was genuine. 
     125   The seed sown in Dyson flowered in R v Pritchard (1836) 7 C & P 303, where the defendant, who was a deaf mute, was tried for the capital felony of bestiality. The trial Judge ordered that the jury be empanelled to decide whether the defendant was mute by the visitation of God. The jury found that he was so. They were then sworn to decide whether he could plead to the indictment. It was proved that he could read and write, having been taught in the Deaf and Dumb Asylum in London. The indictment was given to him, which he read, and by making a sign, he pleaded not guilty. The jury then found that he was able to plead. But was he fit to plead? 
     126   In order to deal with this question, Alderson B, ordered the jury to decide whether the defendant was sane or not. On this question they were given what was to become the classic direction in relation to fitness to plead: 
      
       
        
        “The question is, whether the prisoner has sufficient understanding to comprehend the nature of this trial, so as to make a proper defence to the charge….There are three points to be inquired into: - First, whether the prisoner is mute of malice or not; secondly, whether he can plead to the indictment or not; thirdly, whether he is of sufficient intellect to comprehend the course of proceedings of the trial, so as to make a proper defence – to know that he might challenge any of you to whom he may object – and to comprehend the details of the evidence, which in a case of this nature must constitute a minute investigation. Upon this issue, therefore, if you think that there is no certain mode of communicating the details of the trial to the prisoner, so that he can clearly understand them, and be able to make proper his defence to the charge; you ought to find that he is  
        not of sane mind 
        .” 
        
       
      
      
      The jury found that the defendant was not of sane mind by reason of mental deficiency, and hence “not capable of taking his trial”. He was then ordered to be detained in accordance with the 1800 Act. 
       
     127   Alderson B’s classic direction was relied upon by the High Court in Governor of Stafford Prison ex p Emery (1909) 2 KB 81, a case of a deaf mute who could neither read nor write nor communicate by sign language. On appeal, it was argued that he should not have been made the subject of an order under section 2 of the Criminal Lunatics Act because there was no evidence that he was “insane”.  
     128   Lord Alderstone CJ, rejected that submission, stating at p 86: 
      
       
        
        “It seems to me that when one looks at the words which follow the word ‘insane’ in s.2 of the Act of 1800 - ‘so that such person cannot be tried upon such indictment’ - we ought to construe the word ‘insane’ with reference to the question whether the prisoner can or cannot be tried upon the indictment; and we ought not to say that Parke J and Alderson B and the other judges who considered the matter misdirected the jury as to the test of insanity for the purpose of this Act. I cannot find in any text-book which I have seen that any doubt has ever been thrown upon the view acted upon by those learned judges’.” 
        
       
     129   Other decisions which support this proposition include R v Berry (1876) 1 QBD 447; R v Whitfield (1850) 3 C. & K. 121; R v Robertson 52 Cr App R 690 at 692. 
     130   These cases firmly established that individuals found unfit to plead were to be considered insane on arraignment. This meant that the unfit to plead defendant was to be dealt with under the provisions of s 2 of the Criminal Lunatics Act 1800 (UK), which provided that: 
      
       
        
        “If any person indicted for any offence  
        shall be insane, and shall upon arraignment be found so to be 
         by a jury lawfully empanelled for that purpose, so that such person cannot be tried upon such indictment … it shall be lawful for the Court … to direct such finding to be recorded, and thereupon to order such persons to be kept in strict custody until His Majesty’s pleasure shall be known.” 
        
       
     131   Whether or not the extended and possibly artificial judicial interpretation of “insanity” as used in the Criminal Lunatics Act 1880, has survived the passage of legislation in this State, lies at the heart of the question which arises in this appeal.  
     132   It has been suggested that the broad interpretation was developed as a compassionate response to the problems of those who, although not insane or mentally ill within the ordinary meaning of those terms, would have faced insuperable problems in presenting a defence at a time when legal aid was unavailable, and when the consequences of conviction included hanging or transportation: (C Emmins “Unfitness to Plead: Thoughts prompted by Glenn Pearson’s Case” (1986) Crim LR 604 at 612-613).  
      
       
      Further Development of the Law in the United Kingdom 
       
     133   In the years before the Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964 (UK)  there were attempts to construct a common law discretion, in the trial judge, to postpone the determination of fitness to plead until the general issue of guilt or innocence had been tried. In R v Roberts [1953] 2 All ER 340 the Court gave support to the existence of such a discretion when it found that the accused ought not to be denied the opportunity of being acquitted, thereby avoiding the risk of being detained indefinitely without any determination of his guilt. 
     134   In R v Beynon [1957] 2 All ER 513 this issue was re-determined. Before indictment the Crown submitted that the issue of the accused’s fitness should be tried. Byrne J rejected the approach in Roberts as being unsupported by authority and contrary to first principles, referring to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Dashwood [1943] 1 KB 1 where it had been held: 
      
       
        
        “It is a cardinal principle of our law that no man can be tried for a crime unless he is in a mental condition to defend himself.” 
        
       
       
      The Court held that it was necessary to try the issue of fitness first, notwithstanding the adverse consequences of a finding of unfitness. 
       
     135   The question arose again in R v Podola (1960) 43 Cr App R 220. In this case the accused argued that he was unfit to stand trial, as he had lost his memory of the relevant period, through a condition of hysterical amnesia. The trial Judge instructed the jury to consider whether the accused’s amnesia was genuine, and if so, whether he was unfit to stand trial. The jury found that the accused did not suffer amnesia, and he was later convicted and sentenced to death. 
     136   Although the accused did not appeal against the conviction, an appeal was lodged by the Home Secretary to determine whether there had been a misdirection on the subject of fitness to plead, concerning whether or not the onus of proof rested on the prosecution or the defence. 
     137   The Court of Criminal Appeal found that even if the accused had in fact lost his memory this would not impact upon his fitness to be tried. Of relevance in this regard are the following passages in the judgment of the Court given by Lord Parker CJ: (at pp 353 to 355) 
      
       
        
        “The words ‘If any person … shall be insane … so that ‘such person cannot be tried upon such indictment’ contained in section 2 of the Act of 1800  
        have 
         in many cases since 1800  
        been construed as including persons who are not insane within the M’Naughten Rules 
        , but who by reason of some physical or mental condition,  
        cannot follow the proceedings at the trial and so cannot make a proper defence in those proceedings 
        . A well-known illustration is that of a deaf mute who is also unable to write or to use and understand sign language. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        It is not suggested in this case that the appellant could not plead to the indictment, or that he did not know he had the right of challenge, or that he could not follow the evidence given, but (Counsel) submitted strongly that where there was the partial obliteration of memory alleged in this case, a prisoner could not make a proper defence and could not ‘comprehend’ the details of the evidence within the meaning of the words used in  
        Pritchard’s  
        case. 
        
       
       
        
        .. 
        
       
       
        
        In our judgment the direction given by Alderson B is not intended to cover and does not cover a case where the prisoner can plead to the indictment and has the physical and mental capacity to know that he has the right of challenge and to understand the case as it proceeds. 
        
       
       
        
        This case is the first attempt in England to assert that hysterical amnesia covering the period of the events which are the subject of the indictment renders a man insane so that he cannot be tried The matter has however, come before the courts in Scotland.” 
        
       
     138   After referring to two such decisions, including that of Russell v HM Advocate (1946) S.C. (J) 37, his Lordship continued: 
      
       
        
        “We agree with the opinions stated and the conclusions arrived at in the case of  
        Russell 
        . The word used in the Act of 1800 is the word ‘insane’. It is true that in the case of a deaf mute the word ‘insane’ does not strictly apply, but as was pointed out by Lord Alderstone CJ in  
        Rex v Governor of Stafford Prison, Ex parte Emery 
        ,  
        the practice of including as coming within that word the case of persons who, from mental or physical infirmity, cannot follow what is happening in a case is in accordance with reason and common sense 
        . We cannot see that it is in accordance either with reason or common sense to extend the meaning of the word to include persons who are mentally normal at the time of the hearing of the proceedings against them, and are perfectly capable of instructing their solicitors as to what submission their counsel is to put forward with regard to the commission of the crime.” 
        
       
     139   In addition, the Court found that there was no discretion to postpone the fitness hearing until the end of the trial. Lord Parker observed at 429:  
      
       
        
        “Indeed, if a court becomes aware, either before or during a trial, that the accused person’s sanity is doubtful, it is the duty of the court to have the doubt resolved before beginning or continuing the trial.” 
        
       
     140   Following this decision the Criminal Law Revision Committee delivered a report into criminal procedure and insanity. They recommended that the Court have the power to postpone the issue of fitness until any time up to the opening of the defence case, (adopting Lord Devlin’s view in R v Roberts). This recommendation was implemented in S 4 of the Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964. A right of appeal against a finding of unfitness to plead was also provided. 
     141   A finding of unfitness under this legislation had the consequence that an accused was treated in the same fashion as a person found not guilty by reason of insanity. To that extent it maintained the earlier linkage between unfitness to plead and insanity. In each case the Court had no alternative other than to make an order for his or her admission to and detention, in a hospital, subject to restrictions on discharge. The consequences were so harsh that most accused tried to avoid a fitness hearing by pleading to the substantive charge or to some lesser charge. 
     142   This problem was addressed by the Criminal Procedure (Insanity and Unfitness to Plead) Act 1991 (UK) which, while preserving the procedural mechanism of the former Act, provided that a jury should not make a determination of unfitness, except on the evidence of two or more registered medical practitioners, at least one of whom had been approved by the Secretary of State as having special experience in the area of mental disorder. Once again, those found not guilty by reason of insanity and those found unfit to plead were grouped together for the purposes of their subsequent management. The significant change, however, was that the Court became empowered to make an order for admission to a hospital either with or without a restriction direction, or a guardianship order, or a supervision and treatment order, or an order for the absolute discharge of the accused.  
     143   The difference between comprehension of the proceedings and ability to communicate with the accused’s legal advisers, on the one hand, and the ability to conduct a defence wisely or even rationally, on the other hand, was recognised, the test of fitness being concerned with the former and not with the latter. In R v Robertson (1968) 1 WLR 1767, the Court of Appeal ruled, in the case of an accused suffering from a paranoid illness, who was able to comprehend the proceedings, but whose thinking was delusional, that “the mere fact that the appellant was not capable of doing things which were in his own best interests were insufficient ground for a jury to return a finding of disability.” 
      
       
      The Australian Case Law 
       
     144   A similar conclusion to that reached in Pritchard, Podola and Beynon has been reached in cases in this country, which have dealt with the fitness of an accused to stand trial. 
     145   It is convenient to have regard to those authorities which have settled the basic principles, although without dealing directly with the preliminary jurisdictional question which arises here. 
      
       
      Decisions in States or Territories other than New South Wales 
       
     146   Perhaps the seminal case is that of R v Presser [1958] VR 45, where the question of fitness to plead arose in the context of S 426 Crimes Act 1928 (Vic), in relation to a youth in whom the presence of “serious mental defects” had been indicated by two doctors. Smith J said at 46: 
      
       
        
         
        “It appears to me, on the whole of the material before me, that there is a  
        real and substantial question 
         to be considered, in relation to the accused’s fitness to be tried. And that being so, I think that I am under a duty to have that matter determined by a jury before I allow the trial to proceed. I think that the case of  
        Beynon 
        , is of importance on that aspect of the matter.” 
        
       
     147   At p 48, his Honour said, relevantly for present purposes: 
      
       
        
        “There is one further thing that I think I should add …  
        The cases to my mind show clearly that the word “insane” in s 426 does not mean “insane” in the colloquial sense. 
          
        It means ‘of impaired mentality to such a degree as to be unfit to be tried’. 
         Whether an accused man is insane in that sense is, of course, a very different question from the question whether he is insane in the colloquial sense. A mere lack of formal education, a mere lack of familiarity with court forms and procedures, would not, of course, render a man unfit to be tried when he is far from being insane in the colloquial sense. Dixon J, as he then was, mentioned in  
        Sinclair v R 
        , that it does not seem to have been noticed by the text writers how high a degree of intelligence the test might demand if it were literally applied. But he is not there, in my view, suggesting that it should be applied in any extreme sense, or in any over-literal sense. It needs, I think, to be applied in a reasonable and commonsense fashion. And the question I consider, is whether the accused, because of mental defect, fails to come up to certain minimum standards which he needs to equal before he can be tried without unfairness or injustice to him.” 
        
       
     148   These standards, his Honour, defined in terms which have been widely adopted as follows: 
      
       
        
         “He needs, I think, to be able to understand what it is that he is charged with. He needs to be able to plead to the charge and to exercise his right of challenge. He needs to understand generally the nature of the proceeding, namely, that it is an inquiry as to whether he did what he is charged with. He needs to be able to follow the course of the proceedings so as to understand what is going on in court in the general sense, though he need not, of course, understand the purpose of all the various court formalities. He needs to be able to understand, I think, the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given against him; and he needs to be able to make his defence or answer to the charge. Where he has counsel he needs to be able to do this through his counsel and by giving any necessary instructions and by letting his counsel know what his version of the facts is and, if necessary, telling the court what it is. He need not of course, be conversant with court procedure and he need not have the mental capacity to make an able defence; but he must, I think, have sufficient capacity to be able to decide what defence he will rely upon and to make his defence and his version of the facts known to the court and to his counsel, if any.” (at p 48) 
         
        
       
     149   In Ngatayi v The Queen (1980) 147 CLR 1, a case involving s 631 of the Criminal Code (WA), it was confirmed that it was not necessary for the accused to understand the law which governs his or her case, as distinct from having the capacity to understand the nature of the proceedings and to make a proper defence. 
     150   That was a case where the accused, by reason of his Aboriginality, was unable to understand that, under the law of the State, gradations of homicide existed and that he may have had a defence to wilful murder based upon intoxication. 
     151   The provisions applicable were different from those contained in the Procedure Act, insofar as the requirement for a fitness hearing, under the Code arises “if, when the accused person is called upon to plead … it appears to be uncertain, for any reason, whether he is capable of understanding the proceedings at the trial. As Gibbs, Mason and Wilson JJ observed, the Code has been set in a context in which the incapacity has no necessary reference to insanity, or to incapacity, arising from a physical or mental condition. 
     152   Notwithstanding the differences in the relevant legislation, the following extract from their judgment has some relevance for the present appeal, if it be the case that the New South Wales legislation does apply to the intellectually disabled: 
      
       
        
        “Once a real question as to incapacity is raised, the judge must follow the procedure laid down in the section. If counsel raises an issue of incapacity he should indicate the nature of the facts which in his submission will support the view that the accused is incapable of understanding the proceedings so as to be able to make a proper defence. The judge should leave the issue to the jury  
        unless on the facts as stated no reasonable jury, properly instructed, could find that the accused was not capable 
         of understanding the proceedings so as to be able to make a proper defence.” (at p 8) 
        
       
     153   Of interest concerning the dispositions available in relation to an accused who is found unfit, is the following passage in their judgment (at 7-8): 
      
       
        
        “If the incapacity is due to unsoundness of mind the accused will of course be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the legislation in force on the subject of mental health, but in a case  
        where there is no mental or physical disability 
        , there may be no statutory enactment under which the accused can continue to be detained.  
        In such case no doubt he should be discharged.  
        In fact in Reg v Willie (1885) 7 QLJ (NC) 108, Cooper J ordered the discharge of four aboriginals when no interpreter could be found competent to communicate the charge to them. The report does not however disclose the authority, statutory or otherwise, for taking this course.” 
        
       
     154   Whether authority for that course, which was said to be available in R v Willie (1885) 7 QLJ (NC) 108, survived the Criminal Lunatics Act 1800, with its mandatory judicial order for detention in strict custody, is dubious: R v Judge Martin ex parte Attorney General (1973) VR 339. The question of whether a person, who would never be fit to plead, could be detained indefinitely, was considered, although not decided in Jabanardi (1983) 50 ALR 147, where the repugnancy of such a consequence was mentioned. 
     155   Kesavarajah v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 230 was a case involving s 393 Crimes Act 1958 (Vic) and S 20B(3) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). Mason CJ, Toohey and Gaudron JJ there observed, at 245: 
      
       
        
        “…it cannot be doubted that, in the context of s 393, 
        
       
       
        
         
          
           ‘[o]nce a real question as to incapacity is raised, the judge must follow the procedure laid down in the section. ( 
          Ngatayi 
          ) at p.9) 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Sometimes the test has been stated in terms of whether there is a reason to doubt the accused’s fitness to stand trial. However, the judge should leave the issue to be tried by the jury  
        unless no reasonable jury, properly instructed, could find the accused was not fit to be tried.” (references omitted) 
        
       
     156   Relevantly for the jurisdictional question, their Honours said, at 244: 
      
       
        
        “In conformity with the opening words of s. 393, which are based on the language of s. 2 of the  
        Criminal Lunatics Act 
         (1800) that question is to be determined by a jury specifically empanelled for that purpose.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
         it has long been recognised that, in a context such as s 393, the word ‘insane’ does not mean ‘insane in the colloquial sense’. or ‘insane within the M’Naughten Rules’ 
        . In England, the courts have always applied Alderson B’s interpretation in  
        R v Pritchard 
         of s 2 of the Criminal Lunatics Act, namely, that: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
           ‘the question is, whether the prisoner has sufficient understanding to comprehend the nature of his trial, so as to make a proper defence to the charge’. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        In the context of s 393, the word signifies inability, by reason of some  
        physical or mental condition 
        , to follow proceedings of the trial and to make a defence in those proceedings.”  
        (references omitted) 
        
       
     157   In the Northern Territory, the position of a deaf mute Aboriginal youth who was unable to communicate, except by using his hands to ask for simple needs, who did not know of what he stood charged, and who was unable to communicate with his lawyers, arose for consideration, in the case of Roland Ebatarinja, at the committal stage. The relevant legislation was again in very different terms from that in New South Wales, S 357(1) of the Criminal Code being in similar terms to the Code provision considered in Ngatayil. 
     158   Mildren J, held that, as the accused was not required to plead at committal, there was no bar to those proceedings continuing, the question of fitness properly being reserved until the time for him to plead was reached (1997) 92 A Crim R 270. 
     159   An appeal from this decision was dismissed by the Court of Appeal of the Northern Territory. However, an appeal to the High Court (Ebatarinja v Deland & Ors (1998) 157 ALR 385) was allowed, and an order prohibiting the further hearing of the committal was made. This was upon the basis that any committal for trial would occur in circumstances where the evidence was not taken “in the presence or hearing of the defendant”, and where the defendant could not be given the right to give evidence or to say something in answer to the charge.  
     160   It was held by the Court (Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ) that the Magistrate would have no authority to commit the accused for trial, in those circumstances, since: 
      
       
        
        “(24) When s 106 (of the Justices Act) directs the justice to take preliminary examination ‘in the presence or hearing of the defendant’, it lays down a condition precedent to the authority of the justice to commit for trial. The words ‘presence or hearing of the defendant’ have more than a formal significance. It is hardly to be supposed that the conditions of the section can be complied with by taking the preliminary examination in the presence of defendant who is in a coma. 
        
       
       
        
        (25) Whether the examination is conducted in the physical presence or within the actual hearing of the defendant, s 106 will not be complied with unless the defendant is able to understand what has been put against him or her by the ‘persons who know the facts and circumstances of the case’. The necessity for the defendant to understand what is put against him or her is emphasised by the words which s 110 directs the justice to say to the defendant: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘Having heard the evidence for the prosecution, do you wish to be sworn and give evidence … or do you desire to say anything in answer to the charge [?]’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        These words would be meaningless ritual unless the defendant had not only ‘heard’ the evidence for the prosecution but was able to comprehend what was being put against him or her.”  
        
       
     161   These observations have potential relevance for committal proceedings generally, including those conducted in New South Wales, since the Justices Act 1902 similarly makes provision for a defendant to give evidence and to examine and cross examine witnesses (s36), requires evidence for the prosecution to be “taken in the presence of” the defendant (S41 (1B)(a)), and requires the Justice to give the defendant the opportunity of saying anything in answer to the charge before making an order for committal. (S41 (4)). No provision or allowance is made in respect of defendants whose fitness to plead or to be tried is in question.  
     162   The Court indicated in Ebatarinja that there was no reason why the Crown should not move to lift the stay of an ex officio indictment which had been filed in the Supreme Court, so as to allow the question of fitness to heard in that Court, there being no authority residing in a Magistrate to deal with the question. That was the course subsequently taken. 
     163   In R v Miller (No 2) (2000) SASC 152, Martin J held that an accused, who was suffering from a similar intellectual disability to that of the present appellant, as well as possible frontal lobe damage, was “mentally unfit to stand trial,” upon the basis that he was unable to understand the charge. This decision, however, as outlined previously, was made in the context of the definition provided by S 269H of the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 as follows: 
      
       
        
        “269H. A person is mentally unfit to stand trial on a charge of an offence if the person’s  
        mental processes 
         are so disordered or impaired that the person is: 
        
       
       
        
        a) unable to understand or to respond rationally to the charge or the allegations on which the charge is based; or 
        
       
       
        
        b) unable to exercise (or to give rational instructions about the exercise of) procedural rights (such as, for example, the right to challenge jurors); or 
        
       
       
        
        c) unable to understand the nature of the proceedings, or to follow the evidence or the course of the proceedings. 
        
       
     164   In Eastman v The Queen (2000) 74 ALJR 915 the issue arose in the context of s 428E Crimes Act 1928 (ACT) and s68 (3) of the Mental Health (Treatment and Care) Act 1994 (ACT), in relation to whether an appellate court has a duty to consider fitness to plead of its own initiative, ie where the matter had not been raised at trial. 
     165   Although in the minority, in relation to whether or not the Full Court of the Federal Court should have inquired into the appellant’s fitness, the statement of principle contained in the judgment of Gaudron J has considerable relevance for the present case, it being a statement not questioned in any of the other judgments. 
     166   Her Honour observed (at pp 49-51): 
      
       
        
        “(59) A number of matters should be noted with respect to what was said in  
        Presser. 
         The first is that the question whether a person is fit to plead may arise for reasons other than mental illness. It may arise, for example, because a person is deaf and dumb or, more generally, because language difficulties make it impossible for him or her to make a defence. The second matter to be noted is that fitness to plead is a 
         concept that derives from the common law 
        . Usually, however, there are statutory provisions which bear on the determination of that issue. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (62) The significance of the question of a person’s fitness to plead is often expressed in terms indicating that, unless a person is fit to plead, there can be no trial. If a person stands trial notwithstanding that there is an unresolved issue as to his or her fitness to plead, or, if that issue is not determined in the manner which the law requires, ‘ 
        no proper trial has taken place [and the] trial is a nullity’.  
        To put the matter another way, there is a fundamental failure in the trial process. 
        
       
       
        
        (63) The question whether there was a fundamental failure in the trial process is different from the question whether there was a miscarriage of justice in the sense that the accused lost a chance of acquittal that was fairly open. If a proceeding is fundamentally flawed because the accused was not fit to plead or if, to use the words in  
        Begum 
         ‘the trial [is] a nullity’, the only course open to an appellate court is to set aside the verdict. And that is so regardless of the strength of the case against the accused or of the likely outcome of a further trial according to law. That is the basis upon which this court proceeded in  
        Kasavarajah v R 
        , where the question of fitness to plead should have been but was not submitted to the jury for determination. 
        
       
       
        
        (64) Traditionally, an accused person has not been put on trial unless fit to plead because of “the humanity of the law of England falling into that which common humanity, without any written law would suggest, has prescribed that no man shall be called upon to make his defence at a time when his mind is in that situation as not to appear capable of so doing.” That statement may indicate a positive and independent right on the part of an accused not to be tried unless fit to plead. It is unnecessary to decide whether that is so.  
        It is sufficient to approach the present matter on the basis that the common law guarantees an accused person a fair trial according to law and that one aspect of that guarantee is that a criminal trial cannot proceed unless the accused is fit to plead. 
        
       
       
        
        (65) It is in the context of the common law’s guarantee of a fair trial according to law that s 428E of the Act is to be construed. It is well settled that a statute is not to be construed as abrogating fundamental common law principles unless that is manifestly clear from its terms or as a matter of necessary implication.” (References omitted). 
        
       
       
     167   Although similarly in the minority, as to whether the Court could receive further evidence as to the appellant’s mental state, and/or as to whether the Full Federal Court should have made inquiries about his fitness, Hayne and Callinan JJ, each underlined the fundamental importance, at Common law, of the accused being fit to plead and to stand trial. 
     168   Hayne J (at pages 111-112) observed: 
      
       
        
        “(294) …There can be no trial at all unless the accused is fit both to plead and to stand trial. Because the question of fitness is one which affects whether the accused has the capacity to make a defence or answer the charge, it is a question for the trial judge to consider regardless of whether the prosecution or the accused raise it. In that respect it is a question which falls outside the adversarial system. Indeed it 
         must  
        fall outside the adversarial system because the very question for consideration is whether there is a competent adversary. 
        
       
       
        
        (295) In the great majority of cases no question of fitness arises. But if it does the question for a trial judge is whether the accused may not be fit to plead or stand trial. Only if affirmatively satisfied that the tribunal which is responsible for determining the fitness of the accused (in many jurisdictions, a jury empanelled to determine the question, but in the Australian Capital Territory a statutory tribunal) could  
        not 
         reasonably find that the accused was not fit to stand trial may the trial proceed.  
        
       
       
        
        (296) An issue of fitness may arise in many ways.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        But  
        once there is a ‘real and substantial question to be considered’ 
         the question must be submitted to the body which is empowered to decide the question. There will be a  
        ‘real and substantial question to be considered’ 
         by this body unless no properly instructed jury (or no tribunal) could reasonably conclude that the accused was not fit.” ( 
        References omitted) 
        
       
       
       
     169   Callinan J (at p 120) noted: 
      
       
        
        (332) It may be taken as clearly settled at common law that no one may be tried for a crime unless that person is mentally competent to defend himself or herself, and further, is able to understand the proceedings and the nature of the evidence to be led” 
        
       
       
      And added (at p 138 -139) 
       
       
        
        (399) From very early times in England except for a period during the reign of Henry VIII if a man committed a capital offence while of sound mind but became mad before arraignment he could not be arraigned for the crime. And as far back as pre-Norman times King Alfred hanged Cole, one of his judges, because he judged Ive to death when he was a madman. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Procedural fairness in a criminal trial requires that the accused be aware of the nature of proceedings and be capable of participation in them in fit state to defend himself.  
        
       
       
        
        (400) It is now well established at common law that a finding of unfitness bars further trial and there is statutory jurisdiction in force in most jurisdictions to enable this matter to be determined separately from the trial process. It has been held that, before the question of fitness has to be pursued there must be a ‘real question’, or a ‘real and substantial question or a ‘serious question’.  
        (references omitted) 
        
       
     170   A recent consideration of the ambit of conditions which may warrant a finding of unfitness to stand trial is the South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal’s decision in R v Sexton (2000) 116 A Crim R 173. Sexton applied for a stay of proceedings at his trial on a narcotics charge under the Customs Act on the basis that he was unfit to plead as he was suffering from inoperable heart disease. There was medical evidence that the disease was inoperable and that stress would make him liable to suffer a heart attack. Gray J, Prior and Williams J agreeing, stated at p 184, para 54: 
      
       
        
        “Unfitness to be tried at common law is not limited to cases of mental illness. There are broader considerations, including one’s inability to communicate and participate in the trial process. An inability to communicate or comprehend may be based upon physical disabilities alone, such as hearing and speech impediments. The common law does not require the presence of any psychological or intellectual impairment.” 
        
       
     171   This decision was, however, concerned with the same provision of the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 with which the Court was concerned in Miller. 
      
       
      Decisions in New South Wales 
       
     172   In R v Drummond [1994] NSWCCA, 27 May 1994 the issue arose in a case where the accused claimed that he had amnesia and could not recall committing the offence. It was held applying R v Podola and Russell v His Majesty’s Advocate, and following R v Dennison NSW CCA 3 March 1988, that a condition of amnesia resulting from brain damage of a diffuse kind, does not operate to bar the trial of an accused, and that as a consequence the direction by the trial Judge to the jury to find the accused fit was correct. Gleeson CJ observed, (at p9). 
      
       
        
        “As had been pointed out by Grove J, the decision in  
        R v Dennison 
         is supported by a line of English and Scottish authorities to the effect that amnesia does not constitute unfitness to plead to a criminal charge. 
        
       
       
        
        The common sense behind this conclusion is, I consider, fairly apparent. There may be any number of reasons why a person accused of a crime may be unable to recollect the events of the occasion on which the alleged crime occurred. Amnesia may be one such reason; age, other forms of infirmity, or simply distance in time between the alleged events and the trial, might explain the inability to recollect. The fact that an accused person cannot, for one reason or another, recollect the events of the occasion of the alleged crime does not mean that the accused is, within the words of  
        R v Presser 
        , incapable of letting Counsel know what his version of the facts is. The accused person who says to his counsel “I can’t remember what happened on that day” is not thereby unfit to plead. 
        
       
     173   In R v Zhang [2000] NSWCCA 344 the Court held that once the accused’s fitness to be tried had been raised in good faith, as the Crown Prosecutor had done, on the fourth day of the trial, it was not open to the Crown to ‘withdraw the application’. The failure to determine the question in accordance with the Act resulted, it was held, in a mistrial. 
     174   Dunford J there observed: 
      
       
        
        “25 In my view the provisions of s 10 are explicit and mandatory. If the question of a person’s unfitness to be tried is raised after the person has been arraigned, the Court  
        must 
        , as soon as practicable after the question is raised, conduct an inquiry in order to determine whether such person is unfit to be tried. There are only two exceptions provided for, one is provided by subs (2) namely that it appears to the court that the question has not been raised in good faith … 
        
       
       
        
        26 In the present case his Honour expressly found that the question had been raised in good faith, and consequently there was no alternative, even though it may have been inconvenient, but to discharge the existing jury and conduct the inquiry required by s 10(1) before a different jury (s 11)….. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        28 It was submitted on behalf of the Crown that before s 10 came into operation the trial judge had to be satisfied that there was a real and substantial question to be considered in relation to the accused’s fitness to be tried, and reference was made to  
        R v Presser 
        ,  
        Kesavarajah v The Queen 
         and  
        Eastman v The Queen 
        . However, those cases related to the procedure under the relevant Victorian and Australian Capital Territory legislation respectively, both of which were in significantly different terms to s 10. 
        
       
       
        
        29. Counsel for the Crown expressed concern that there was a need for a  
        further threshold test in addition 
         to that raised in  
        good faith 
          
        test 
         provided by subs (2), because the question could be raised in good faith but inappropriately, for example by an over anxious party. Not only do I consider such an occurrence most unlikely but, whatever the position may be at common law and in other states 
        , s 10 admits of no other threshold test 
        . Of course if the judge considered that the question was raised merely for tactical reasons, he or she would not find that it was raised in good faith. No question of that nature arises in this case.” 
        
       
     175   In R v Tier [2001] NSWCCA 53, the Court looked at the question whether the issue was raised in good faith, in a case where the trial Judge had twice declined to direct a fitness hearing in circumstances where the accused had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital during the trial, with a diagnosis of major depression, which was confirmed by a number of experts, and where his solicitor had reported difficulties in communicating with him. 
     176   Sheller JA noted (para 1): 
      
       
        
        “the cardinal principle that no one can be tried for a crime unless the person is in a mental condition to make a proper defence” 
        
       
       
      and observed in relation to s 10 of the Procedure Act: 
       
       
        
        “No doubt subs (2) was designed to prevent allegations of unfitness, known to be false, interrupting trials.” 
        
       
     177   In relation to the existence of a “real question as to incapacity” being the expression used by Gibbs, Mason and Wilson JJ in Ngatayi, as that which gave rise to the requirement for a fitness hearing, his Honour said (para 4): 
      
       
        
        “In my opinion, in this context to qualify a question as “real” means the same as to qualify it as one that “has been raised in good faith”. Other words or phrases such as “genuinely” or “on the basis of a belief honestly held” may help to explain what is intended.” 
        
       
     178   His Honour continued (para 6): 
      
       
        
         
          
          “I do not understand how it could be said that, if there was a possibility (which the trial judge had accepted as existing while rejecting the view that it was a probability) that the appellant was unfit to be tried, the question of whether he was indeed unfit to be tried could be said not to have been raised in good faith. With due respect, this conclusion may have resulted from a misunderstanding of the expression ‘a real and substantial question’ … 
          
         
        
       
     179   Kirby J first dealt with the common law, observing: 
      
       
        
        “54 Justice requires that any person put on trial should be fit to stand trial. In  
        R v Dashwood 
        , Humphries J said this, on behalf of the Court: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “It is a cardinal principle of our law that no man can be tried for a crime unless he is in a mental condition to defend himself”. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        55 An accused person must be in a position to comprehend the course of proceedings, so as to make a proper defence.  
        (references omitted) 
        
       
     180   His Honour then turned to the Procedure Act, noting: 
      
       
        
        “ 69 This appeal is concerned with the proper construction of s 10 of the Act. If there is a real and substantial issue as to the unfitness of the accused to stand trial, then justice requires that it be determined. It is impossible to imagine, in such circumstances, that a Court would determine (having examined the motivation of the person who raised the question) that it was not raised in good faith, and decline to hold an inquiry. 
        
       
       
        
        70 Against this background, there are two ways in which the construction of s 10 might have been approached. The section repeatedly uses the phrase “raise the question” concerning the unfitness of the accused. One may ‘raise the question’ either by simply identifying the issue, without substantiation, or by the disclosure of some factual basis which, if accepted, gives rise to the real and substantial question concerning the unfitness of the accused to be tried. In  
        Zhang 
         the Court appeared to favour the first of these alternatives ….” 
        
       
       
        
       
     181   His Honour continued: 
      
       
        
        “71 The exception provided by s 10(2) recognises that an inquiry into fitness (involving a separate jury) is disruptive. It will often lead to the discharge of the jury hearing the trial. A mechanism is therefore needed (and is provided, by s10(2)) for the trial Judge to prevent attempts by the accused, or his representatives, to disrupt or abort the trial. No inquiry need be held where it appears to the Court that the question has not been raised in good faith (s10(2)).  
        It will not be raised in good faith where there is no real and substantial question of unfitness, and where the motivation in raising 
          
        the question 
         (which is either transparent or to be imputed)  
        is to disrupt the trial process 
        . Conversely, where there is real and substantial question, good faith will be presumed. 
        
       
       
        
        72 Section 10, therefore suggests a sequence of questions. Usually, an accused person will be represented (s12(1)).  
        Where an accused’s representative raises a question concerning the unfitness of the accused, the trial Judge would ordinarily be expected to accept that the issue has been raised in good faith. 
         Legal representatives, whether barrister or solicitor, are subject to professional obligations. Once raised by a practitioner there is, prima facie, an obligation upon the trial Judge to halt the trial, and to conduct an inquiry before a separate jury. If, however, the basis for concern is not obvious, or the validity of that concern is dubious, it is appropriate for the trial Judge to seek an elaboration upon the matters giving rise to the concern.  
        Where that elaboration demonstrates a real and substantial question, good faith will be presumed 
        . The question of unfitness must then be determined by a separate jury.  
        It is only where there is patently no real and substantial question that the Court may impute an absence of good faith, and decline to conduct an inquiry 
         (s10(2)).” 
        
       
       
      THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY IN NEW SOUTH WALES 
       
     182   It is next convenient to turn to the legislation which dealt with the circumstance, at common law, that those held unfit to be tried were liable to be kept in indeterminate detention, at the Governor’s pleasure; and to examine whether the language used in the Procedure Act, compels an interpretation that would operate to exclude from its reach the developmentally or intellectually disabled.  
     183   The problem which had emerged at common law was first addressed in New South Wales by the Crimes (Mental Disorder) Amendment Act 1983, which inserted Parts XIA and XIB into the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Earlier, the position of persons found to be insane on arraignment, or during trial, had been governed by the Criminal Lunatics Act 1800 (UK) until 1 March 1878, and thereafter by the Lunacy Act 1878 (NSW) until it was replaced by the Mental Health Act 1958 (NSW).  
     184   The Lunacy Act 1878 had defined an “insane person” as: 
      
       
        
        “Any person who for the time being be idiotic lunatic or of unsound mind and incapable of managing himself or his affairs and whether found insane by inquisition or otherwise.” 
        
       
       
        
       
     185   By Section 58 of the Lunacy Act 1878 it was provided:  
      
       
        
        “If any person indicted for any offence shall be insane and shall upon arraignment be found so to be by a jury lawfully [em]panelled for that purpose so that such person cannot be tried upon such indictment or if upon the trial of any person so indicted such person shall appear to the jury charged with such indictment to be insane it shall be lawful for the Court before which any such person shall be brought to be arraigned or tried aforesaid to direct such finding to be recorded and thereupon to order such person be kept in strict custody in such a place and in such a manner as to the Court may seem fit until he shall be dealt with as hereinafter provided …..” 
        
       
     186   Section 59 of the Lunacy Act 1878 stated that a person found insane before trial was to be sent to a hospital for the criminal insane. 
      
       
        
        “When any person committed to take his trial for any offence shall be certified by two medical practitioners in the form of Schedule 2 to be insane or shall upon arraignment be found by verdict to be insane the Colonial Secretary may direct by order under his hand in the form of Schedule 15 that such person be removed to an hospital until he shall be certified by the medical officer and the Inspector General or by the said medical officer and two official visitors to be of sound mind whereupon the Colonial Secretary shall order his removal to the gaol from whence he came in order to his being tried for such offence. Provided that such detention for any period shall not operate as a bar to his subsequent indictment and trial for such offence.” 
        
       
     187   Similarly s 23(1) of the Mental Health Act 1958 provided: 
      
       
        
        “If any person indicted for an offence is mentally ill and, upon arraignment, is found to be so by a jury lawfully empanelled for that purpose so that such person cannot be tried upon such indictment, or if upon the trial of any person so indicted such person is found by the jury, before whom he is tried, to be mentally ill, the judge before whom any such person is brought to be arraigned or tried as aforesaid may direct such findings to be recorded, and thereupon may order such person to be kept in strict custody in such place and in such manner as to such judge may seem fit until he is dealt with as provided by section twenty-four of this Act.” 
        
       
     188   Under s 24 of the 1958 Act, persons certified by two medical practitioners to be mentally ill before the trial, or found to be so upon arraignment, were to be removed to and detained in a mental hospital. 
     189   Under s 4 of that Act “mentally ill person” was defined as: 
      
       
        
        “a person who owing to mental illness requires care, treatment or control for his own good or in the public interest, and is for the time being incapable of managing himself or his affairs and ‘mentally ill’ has a corresponding meaning.” 
        
       
     190   The procedure for dealing with those persons who were potentially unfit to be tried was changed, following enactment of the Crimes (Mental Disorder) Amendment Act 1983, which was the precursor to the current legislation. That Act was cognate with the Mental Health Act 1983, in the same way that the 1990 Procedure and Health legislation are cognate, and came into operation on 22 August 1986. 
     191   It is clear from the Second Reading Speech when the Bills were was first introduced in 1982, with the intention that they lie in the House until the next Session, that this legislation was intended to deal with the problem that a person who had been found unfit to plead might be detained indefinitely at the Governor’s pleasure in a mental hospital or prison, without ever having an opportunity to present a defence case. It is also clear from that speech that the legislation was intended to apply to the intellectually disabled, as well as to those suffering from some form of mental illness. The Minister, the Honourable Laurie Brereton, said in this regard: 
      
       
        
        “I turn now to the question of unfitness to be tried, which will be dealt with in the new part XIA of the Crimes Act. It is a well-established and fundamental principle of our criminal justice system that a person cannot be tried for an offence unless he is in a condition to defend himself, that is, unless he is fit to plead.  
        As this concept has developed, it has encompassed all persons who, for whatever reason, are unable to understand clearly the course and nature of the proceedings of the trial so as to make a proper defence, or to challenge a juror or to communicate adequately with a lawyer 
        . Although the original concept of fitness to plead was developed in regard to persons who were clearly insane, the notion of fitness to be tried  
        has come to be understood as covering all persons who from whatever cause are unable to plead, understand the proceedings or communicate with others 
        .  
         
        … 
        
       
       
        
        At present, if an accused person is found unfit to plead, the trial judge, in virtually all cases, will order that the accused be kept in strict custody in such place and manner as the judge thinks fit. This means detention in a mental hospital or prison. The major weakness in the present system is that a person may be detained indefinitely without having had an opportunity to present a defence case. In particular,  
        if a person is mentally retarded 
        , he or she may never become fit in the future so as to come before a court for trial. He or she may never get out, in effect.” 
        
       
     192   After noting some other deficiencies in the existing system relating to the onus of proof, and difficulties associated with the absence of any procedure for review, the Minister continued:  
      
       
        
        “It is towards overcoming these deficiencies that the provisions of part XIA of the Bill, entitled ‘Unfitness to be tried for an offence’, are directed. It is considered that the concept of unfitness to be tried is a more accurate statement of what is involved rather than fitness to plead. Proposed clause 428B states that a person is unfit to be tried for an offence (if) because of disability he is incapable of understanding the nature or purpose of the proceedings brought against him; or he is incapable of communicating adequately with a person for the purpose of conducting a defence to those proceedings.  
        The preceding provision, proposed section 428A defines disability to include mental illness, intellectual handicap, developmental disability of mind, speech impairment, and any combination of them. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        To overcome the possibility of a person who is found unfit being lost in the system without the merits of his case ever being considered, proposed section 428I (2)(c) provides for the holding of a special inquiry. The rationale behind this provision is that once a person is found unfit, no procedure currently exists to examine whether such a person committed the offence. This  
        is a particularly difficult situation for the mentally retarded, who are unlikely ever to be fit to be tried according to the conventional rules 
        . Such persons may be locked up forever, with no prospect of release. 
        
       
       
        
        Under the proposed procedure when it is found that a person will not become fit during the next twelve months a special inquiry must be held so far as is practicable within thirty days of the finding of unfitness to determine whether the person committed the offence or whether the person is not guilty of the offence. This will allow the  
        mentally retarded accused person 
         his day in court and at least the opportunity to have the charges against him dismissed. ( 
        Legislative Assembly Debates 24 November 1982 at 3005 to 3006)” 
        
       
     193   While it was assumed that all persons who could not understand the nature of the proceedings against them, including those with an intellectual disability, were to be considered unfit to be tried, and that the Act was to apply to them, the proposed definition provision (section 428A) was deleted when the Bill was re-introduced some twelve months later. So it was that the Minister said in November 1983, when the amended Bills were read:  
      
       
        
         
        “The next matter dealt with in the Crimes (Mental Disorder) Amendment Bill is that of fitness to be tried. These provisions have been revised but remain broadly provisions for a scheme whereby  
        mentally handicapped people, the developmentally disabled, 
         have a proper opportunity, when charged with criminal offences, for their presumed innocence to be demonstrated...” 
         
         
        “Following comments by one Supreme Court Judge, the attempt in the previous draft to define unfitness in the statute has been removed. The  
        definition of what will constitute unfitness under the new law 
         will remain for the courts to work out on a case-by-case basis”. (Legislative Assembly Debates, 29 November 1983 at p 3090.) 
         
        
       
     194   Consequently, Part XIA, was silent as to what constituted unfitness and did not expressly address the question of to whom the Chapter applied. It did not contain any definition of mental illness or mental condition. The use of the words “unfitness to be tried” however, reflected a shift in terminology from the Mental Health Act 1958 which had used the terms “mental illness upon arraignment” or “mental illness upon trial”.  
     195   Presumably one purpose of this shift was to remove the semantic difficulty involved in artificially defining a person incapable of communication with his or her lawyers as a person who is “mentally ill”. However, whether that purpose was achieved remains to be examined. 
     196   It is also relevant to note that section 428W of the 1983 Act, which was contained in Chapter 2 (Proceedings before a Magistrate Other Than Committal Proceedings), specifically addressed the issue of “developmentally disabled or mentally disordered” defendants who were not “mentally ill persons” within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1983, where such persons were involved in proceedings before a Magistrate. The present legislation, which repeats this formula, was obviously copied from the 1983 Act. 
     197   The Crimes (Mental Illness) Amendment Act 1986, No 93 again altered the terminology, and amended s 428B Crimes Act 1900, concerning the definition of “mental condition”. According to The Honourable B. J Unsworth, when delivering the Second Reading Speech:  
      
       
        
        “These amendments will also clarify the meaning of the term mental condition which is used in both the new Mental Health Act and the Crimes (Mental Disorder) Amendment Act, 1983. This term is used in both Acts to allow persons who are not mentally ill under the Mental Health Act, but who suffer from an abnormal mental condition to be referred to appropriate treatment in a psychiatric hospital where they consent to that course of action. For the purpose of clarification,  
        the term mental condition is to be defined as a condition of disability of mind not including either mental illness or developmental disability of mind. 
         The term is intended to encompass conditions which are not covered by the term mental illness but which can be treated in a hospital: for example drug or alcohol dependency.”  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        “The first cognate bill is the Crimes (Mental Illness) Amendment Bill 1986. As I have previously mentioned the main bill will insert a definition of the term mental condition. Similarly that term is defined in the same way by inserting that definition into the Crimes Act 1900. A further term mentally disordered is also clarified in the cognate bill by removing the provisions applicable to the term (from the proceedings before magistrates) and substituting instead the expression “is suffering from a mental illness or is suffering from a mental condition for which treatment is available in hospital”… 
         
        (Legislative Assembly Debates (NSW) 24 April 1986 p 2674-2675) 
        
       
     198   The Second Reading Speeches concerning the passage of the 1990 Procedure Act and the Health Act, (each of which received the assent on 1 June 1990 and commenced on 3 September 1990) did not address the definition of the expression “mental disorder” used in the heading to Part 2 of the Procedure Act. The Parliamentary debates focussed primarily upon the impact of the amendments effected by the Health Act to the 1983 Act, which had remained largely unproclaimed as it was overly complex and legalistic. A definition of “mental illness” was, however, adopted by that Act, the terms of which have previously been mentioned, and which in the speeches was expressly distinguished from the expression “mentally disordered persons” which it appears was intended to include the temporarily irrational, for whom (as people with a mental condition) treatment was available.  
     199   The following observations were made in relation to the Procedure Bill by the Minister (the Honourable Virginia Chadwick): 
      
       
        
        “the second cognate bill is the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Bill. This cognate bill will re-enact provisions relating to proceedings involving persons affected by mental illness and other mental conditions, which are currently contained in parts 11A and 11B of the Crimes Act 1900, with appropriate amendments consequential upon the drafting of the Mental Health Bill. It was considered that these provisions should more appropriately be placed in a new principal piece of legislation. It is intended that this legislation will provide clarification and simplification of the very complex area of mental health legislation (Hansard Legislative Council 2 May 1990 p 2138). 
        
       
     200   The 1990 Act has itself been the subject of amendment by the Criminal Legislation (Amendment) Act 1992, the Mental Health (Amendment) Act 1994, the Crimes Legislation (Unsworn Evidence) Amendment Act 1994, the Mental Health Legislation Amendment Act 1997, and the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sentencing Act) 1999, although not in a way that assists in the resolution of the jurisdictional question which here arises. 
     201   The existence of some uncertainty, and imprecision in relation to the position of the intellectually disabled, who do not suffer from a mental condition, has not gone unnoticed. The NSW Law Reform Commission in its Report 80 People with an Intellectual Disability and the Criminal Justice System recommended (at p 52) that a definition of “intellectual disability” be introduced into the Procedure Act. It also suggested that the failure to specifically recognise the needs of intellectually disabled people needed to be addressed (at p 174). However, this issue was not raised in relation to whether an intellectually disabled person could be found unfit to be tried under Part 2, but rather, it was raised with regard to the process of review employed by the Mental Health Review Tribunal, and in particular the determination which it is required to make as to the services or treatment for forensic patients, but which are confined to their patients with a mental illness or a mental condition.  
      
       
     202   The Commission recognised that the terminology used in the Procedure Act and in the Mental Health Act was both confusing and inappropriate, and that difficulty lies in the overlap between the civil and criminal patients who come within the control or supervision of the Mental Health Review Tribunal. The Commission suggested that the term “forensic patient” was also inappropriate as it implies that the person is ill, and in need of either hospital or medical care. 203   The Commission also suggested that the provisions of the Procedure Act be returned to the Crimes Act, to avoid confusion caused by the title of the Act, which it assumed, both in its short and long form, suggested that its provisions only apply to those who are mentally ill, whereas in truth, it observed, the issue of an accused’s fitness potentially extends to a much broader category of persons, including those with an intellectual disability. (Report 80 (1996) People with an Intellectual Disability and the Criminal Justice System, paras 5.7). 
      
       
      INTERPRETATION OF PART 2 
       
     204   This brings me to the question whether there is any proper basis for the assumption made by the Law Reform Commission, by reference to any relevant canon or principle of statutory interpretation, in addition to those previously mentioned, which have caused me to refer to the apparent purpose of the legislation and to such extrinsic materials as appeared to be relevant.  
     205   One such principle that may assist is that which declares that legislation is presumed not to alter common law doctrines, or to invade common law rights, especially those of a person accused of crime: R v Young (1999) 46 NSWLR 681 at 731, see Gaudron J, in R v Eastman (supra)  and Radway v The Queen (1990) 169 CLR 515.  
     206   While it is the case that legislation can override the common law, the courts do require that it be clearly shown that the legislature intended to do so. This presumption represents the philosophy that it is the responsibility of the courts to protect the individual against the excesses of the state. (Pearce and Geddes: Statutory Interpretation in Australia 4th Edition 1996, P 141)   
     207   While Australian Courts have recognised that the will of the legislature must prevail, they have frequently referred to the presumption and have not been reluctant in applying it. In FCT v Citibank (1989) 85 ALR 588 for example French J stated:  
      
       
        
        “The nature of our society, and its tradition of respect for individual freedoms, will support an approach to construction which requires close scrutiny and strict reading of statutes which would otherwise remove or encroach upon those freedoms. But where the natural meaning of the words is clear, the will of the Parliament must be respected.” (at 614) 
        
       
     208   A further principle of potential relevance is that which is applicable where it appears that Parliament has failed by inadvertence, to deal with an eventuality that is required to be dealt with, if the purpose of a Statute is to be achieved. This principle was examined by Spigelman CJ in R v Young (1999) 46 NSWLR 681, where his Honour said at (686 to 687): 
      
       
        
        “6. In order to construe the words actually used by parliament, it is sometimes necessary to give them an effect as if they contained additional words. This is not, however, to introduce words into the Act.  
        This involves the construction of words actually used. 
         Judicial statements which appear to have been prepared to countenance something more than this should be so understood. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        9. The contemporary approach is as set out by Lord Diplock in  
        Wentworth Securities v Jones  
        [1980] AC 74 at 105-107: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘My Lords I am not reluctant to adopt a purposive construction where to apply the literal meaning of the legislative language used would lead to results which would clearly defeat the purposes of the Act. But in doing so the task in which a court of justice is engaged remains one of construction; even where this involves reading into the Act words which are not expressly included in it.  
          Kammins Ballrooms Co Ltd v Zenith Investments (Torquay) Ltd  
          provides an instance of this; but in that case the three conditions that must be fulfilled in order to justify this course were satisfied. First, it was possible to determine from a consideration of the provisions of the Act read as a whole precisely what the mischief was that it was the purpose of the Act to remedy; second, it was apparent that the draftsman and parliament had by inadvertence overlooked, and so omitted to deal with, an eventuality that required to be dealt with if the purpose of the Act was to be achieved; and thirdly, it was possible to state with certainty what were the additional words that would have been inserted by the draftsman and approved by parliament had their attention been drawn to the omission before the Bill passed into law. Unless this third condition is fulfilled any attempt by a court of justice to repair the omission in the Act cannot be justified as an exercise of its jurisdiction to determine what is the meaning of a written law which Parliament has passed. Such an attempt crosses the boundary between construction and legislation. It becomes a usurpation of a function which under the constitution of this country is vested in the legislature to the exclusion of the courts.’ 
          
         
         
        11. The three conditions set out by Lord Diplock should not be misunderstood. His Lordship did not say, nor do I take any of their Honours who have adopted the passage to suggest, that whenever the three conditions are satisfied, a court is at liberty to supply the omission of the legislature. Rather, his Lordship was saying that in the absence of any one of the three conditions, the court cannot construe a statute with the effect that certain words appear in the statute. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        14. Putting to one side obvious typographical errors, the court supplies words “omitted’ by the draftsperson only in the sense that the words so included reflect in express, and therefore more readily observable form, the true construction of the words actually used. In my opinion, the authorities do not warrant the court supplying words ‘omitted’ by inadvertence per se. 
        
       
       
        
        15. Where the words actually used are not reasonably capable of being construed in the manner contended for, they will not be so construed; If a court can construe the words actually used by the parliament to carry into effect the parliamentary intention, it will do so notwithstanding that the specific construction is not the literal construction and even if it is a strained construction. The process of construction will, for example, sometimes cause the court to read down general words, or to give the words used an ambulatory operation. So long as the court confines itself to the range of possible meanings or of operation of the text - using consequences to determine which meaning should be selected - then the process remains one of construction.” 
        
       
     209   His Honour continued at 690: 
      
       
        
        “32 The two techniques of construction to which I have referred - reading down general words and giving words an ambulatory construction - are based on the text. In my opinion, there is no warrant for supplying omitted words, unless the result of some such recognised technique of construction can be so described. 
        
       
       
        
        33 It is not, in my opinion, appropriate to take an expression of intention from intrinsic materials to supply the omission by the draftsperson, when the result cannot reasonably be deduced from the words actually used by a recognised technique of construction. 
        
       
       
        
        As McHugh J has put it in  
        Newcastle City Council v GIO General Ltd: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘extrinsic material cannot be used to construe a legislative provision unless the construction of the provision suggested by that material is one that is ‘reasonably open’. Even if extrinsic material convincingly indicates the evil at which a section was aimed, it does not follow that the language always permits a construction that will remedy that evil. If the legislature uses language which covers only one state of affairs, a court cannot legitimately construe the words of the section in a tortured and unrealistic manner to cover another set of circumstances.’ 
          
         
        
       
     210   In Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) (1981) 147 CLR 297, the legislative inadvertence rule was applied so as to not give to the word ‘company’ in a particular paragraph, the extended meaning which was given to it elsewhere. As Spigelman CJ explained, (at 689 in R v Young), that was not a case of inserting words to perfect the intention of Parliament. The actual words were “construed to conform with the intention, where they may reasonably be so construed”. 
     211   The approach of Lord Diplock to statutory construction in Wentworth Securities Ltd v Jones was said by Kirby J in James Hardie & Co Pty Ltd v Seltsan Pty Ltd (1998) 73 ALJR 238 at 253 to be one that “now prevails throughout the common law world”. His Honour added  
      
       
        
        “Today unless driven to the result by unyielding words, no judicial satisfaction is to be derived from concluding that the manifest target of legislation has been missed.” 
        
       
     212   In the present case the individual Sections within Part 2 of the Procedure Act are silent as to the persons to whom they are addressed. Potentially, in those circumstances they apply to each and every accused who is placed on trial in the Supreme and District Courts, ie unless reference to the short or long titles, or to the heading to the Part, or to the cognate legislation, requires their sphere of application to be read down to those suffering from a mental illness or mental condition, in the colloquial sense, or in the sense to be derived from the Health Act.  
     213   It seems to me, in light of the legislative history, and the approach which the common law has consistently taken, concerning the fundamental right for a person placed on trial to have sufficient understanding of the proceedings so as to be able to mount a proper defence, that the Procedure Act should not be read down so as to exclude the developmentally or intellectually disabled. Such a consequence, it seems to me was certainly not intended, and can properly be avoided by an application of the legislative inadvertence rule, as well as by an application of the presumption as to the preservation of the common law previously mentioned.  
     214   To otherwise construe the Procedure Act would be to depart from the extended meaning given to the expression “mental illness” in the context of fitness to be tried, that was developed in Pritchard and Dashwood, And confirmed in Presser, Kesavarajah and Eastman; and potentially to negate a fundamental common law principle of fairness that has the authority of recognition over many centuries. 
     215   Notwithstanding this conclusion, it is the fact that an uncertainty persists as to what should occur at committal in the case of defendant whose fitness to participate in the hearing is under question. Similarly, the proper disposition or management of those accused persons who become forensic patients after a special hearing, and who suffer from an intellectual or developmental disability, rather than from a mental illness or mental condition, does require further consideration. 
      
       
      WAS THE APPELLANT WRONGLY DENIED A FITNESS HEARING? 
       
     216   Upon the assumption that the Procedure Act does potentially apply, as I have found that it does, to persons suffering from an intellectual disability, but without any underlying mental illness or mental condition, strictly so called, the question arises whether the appellant should have been allowed a fitness hearing at trial? 
     217   In my view the approach taken by his Honour at trial in relation to the two applications made by Counsel was in error. Upon the basis of the additional material provided in the form of the report from Dr. O’Dea, who had an advantage not available to Dr. Westmore of long term contact with the appellant, and in the form of the additional experience of the appellant’s legal advisers in the period leading up to and including the trial, which suggested continuing and serious difficulty on their part in communicating with him, and in obtaining instructions, there clearly was a serious question as to his fitness. That position became even more evident from the bizarre behaviour displayed by the appellant between 28 April and 6 May which seems to have resolved only when his medication was provided on a more regular basis, leaving him somewhat sedated and drowsy, as it had done at the Inquest and Committal. 
     218   In this regard there is clear authority for the Court taking into account the appearance and behaviour of an accused when he or she appears for trial: R v Khallouf (1981) VR 360 at 364-5. What was also of importance was the fact that the Crown prosecutor accepted, that the question had been raised by Counsel “in good faith”. 
     219   In dismissing the application, his Honour made no finding that the appellant was deliberately and consciously feigning unfitness or mental illness, or acting in a planned way so as to disrupt the trial and to secure some advantage for himself. Rather, he concluded that the issue had been foreclosed by the earlier hearing, and that what was under consideration was not a fresh application under S10(1) (b) but a continuation of the original application under S10(1)(a). 
     220   It is in this respect that I believe his Honour fell into error. While it was the case, as might have been expected, that the issue of fitness revolved around the appellant’s intellectual disability of which evidence had previously been given, and the difficulty which his legal advisers had in communicating with him, there was in fact more information available to the Court than previously. It was capable of throwing light on those aspects of his comprehension that were relevant for the Presser criteria. 
     221   Additionally, there was the frank demonstration before his Honour of bizarre behaviour which had been absent during the earlier fitness hearing when, it would appear, the appellant had been sedated. In this regard the possible relevance of medication for his fitness, either by reason of its underuse at the trial, or its overuse at the committal and earlier fitness hearing, was expressly raised by defence Counsel, yet left unexplored. This was potentially a matter of some importance since, while appropriate therapeutical medication may have aided the appellant to behave, it would not necessarily have improved his comprehension of the trial. Over-medication reducing him to a comatose state where he was unable to participate, or even to begin to appreciate the events surrounding him, of course, would not have constituted a compliance with Presser. 
     222   In these circumstances, it seems to me that his Honour fell into error in approaching the question on an adversary basis, rather than as a matter in which an obligation to raise and determine the issue rested not only with the parties but also with the Court, and in requiring the existence of fresh or new evidence before allowing the matter to be reventilated. 
     223   As the Procedure Act makes clear, the question of fitness is not determined conclusively, and for all time, at a pre trial hearing, or indeed at any one hearing during a trial. The question remains potentially open, at least until the jury retires to consider their verdict and possibly until that verdict is returned. 
     224   While there is a statutory presumption of fitness once a person has been found fit (S 15(2) of the Procedure Act), it still remains necessary for a trial Judge to interrupt proceedings and to direct that there be a further inquiry if a genuine question as to fitness re-emerges, no matter how inconvenient or disruptive that may be. 
     225   In this regard, I respectfully adopt the observations of Sheller JA and Kirby J in Tier, as to what is a “question of unfitness” within the meaning of the Procedure Act, and as to whether that question has been “raised in good faith”. 
     226   In particular, as Kirby J observed in Tier, at para 84, the question whether the appellant was, as a matter of probability, unfit to be tried, was a question for a jury empanelled to try the question, on the whole of the material available, including the expert evidence, and the lay evidence as to his behaviour both in and out of Court. 
     227   In circumstances where it was common ground that the question had been raised by trial counsel in good faith, and where that aspect was not canvassed by his Honour, it is difficult to understand why the applications were dismissed. While the brake of good faith is an important part of the Procedure Act, and while its content is undefined, I would find it difficult for a Court to make a finding that a question had been raised other than in good faith, where the material available suggested that there was a real and substantial, or a genuine concern as to an accused’s fitness to stand trial, and where Counsel, who it may be assumed had much greater contact with the accused than anyone else, had drawn that matter to attention. 
     228   This question having been unaddressed and there being, in my view, occasion for real or genuine concern in relation to the appellant’s fitness, error has been shown. There was accordingly a fundamental flaw in the trial process, rendering it a nullity, as was held to be the case in R v Begum (1985) 83 Cr App R 96, and Kesavarajah v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 230 at 247. 
     229   I would, accordingly, allow the appeal, quash the conviction and sentence and direct a new trial. 
     230   GREG JAMES J: I agree with the orders proposed by Wood, CJ. at CL. and his reasons therefor. I also agree with the further observations of the Chief Justice.

      REGINA v Reuben Kingsley SWEET 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
     1 SPIGELMAN CJ: The Applicant seeks leave to appeal from a sentence imposed on him by Judge Shadbolt on 24 April 2001, with respect to twenty-four offences of defrauding the Commonwealth, pursuant to s29D of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). 
      
       
     2 The maximum penalty for an offence under s29D is imprisonment for a period of ten years and/or a fine of $110,000. On 24 April 2001, Shadbolt DCJ sentenced the Applicant with respect to each of the twenty-four offences to imprisonment for four years, with a non-parole period of three years. The Applicant wishes to appeal from the alleged severity of this sentence. 
      
       
     3 Between 23 January 1998 and 8 June 2000, the Applicant was paid a Newstart Allowance by the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency to which he was entitled. This followed his release from custody after serving a term of imprisonment for dishonesty offences. During this period, he applied for and was paid Newstart allowances in twenty-four different names. Over the period between September 1998 and June 2000, he was paid a total of $125,065 to which he was not entitled. When he was arrested, the Agency was paying him $7,320 per fortnight to which he was not entitled. 
      
       
     4 The obtaining of these payments required the Applicant to lodge false applications supported by forged documentation and to attend at Agency offices throughout Sydney for the purposes of ensuring the continuation of payments. It also involved the creation of bank accounts in false names to which monies could be paid. 
      
       
     5 Shadbolt DCJ described the scheme as: 
      
       
        
         
         “… A systematic fraud on the system carried out in a business like manner.” 
          
         
        
       
       
       His Honour was amply justified in drawing this conclusion. 
        
       
     6 The Applicant had obtained a number of forged identification documents, including birth extracts, “proof of age” cards issued in Queensland, driver’s licences, a Marriage Certificate, a Certificate of Dissolution of Marriage, a Baptismal Certificate, telephone accounts and medical bills. He opened numerous bank accounts in false names and gave various false addresses, causing mail to be re-directed to a post office box of which he was the lessee. When he was arrested, the police found in his possession an expandable file in which had systematically organised the false documentation, grouped according to the particular false identity to which the documents related. 
      
       
     7 The Applicant had a substantial criminal history to which his Honour referred in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “… He has convictions since 1972 in three States in the Commonwealth including 44 convictions for theft or criminal deception of some sort or another. He has been imprisoned on 8 occasions, the most recent in 1996 and the longest period, for one of 5 years in 1992. It is clear that it is a record which would not permit leniency to be extended to him by this court.” 
          
         
        
       
     8 The criminal history tendered before his Honour revealed many offences involving deception. This included the offences which led to the term of five years imprisonment from December 1992 in Queensland, being for nine counts of misappropriation, which term he served concurrently with sentences for fifteen counts of stealing, seven counts of receiving and a count of bringing stolen goods into Queensland. After his release in August and September 1996, he was convicted in Queensland of three further counts of receiving stolen property. 
      
       
     9 There was nothing remarkable about the subjective circumstances of the Applicant. The principal factor entitling him to a significant discount on sentence was the fact he pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and also he had given assistance to the police, which Shadbolt DCJ correctly described as both “timely and useful”. 
      
       
     10 There is a tendency in severity appeals for applicants to regard a trial judge’s determination as some kind of “starting point” so that if some form of criticism can be directed to one particular element in the judge’s remarks on sentence, that should lead to a favourable result to an applicant. This tendency should be discouraged. The exercise of the sentencing discretion necessarily involves the interconnection of a number of different elements. It cannot be and should not be assumed that the end result would have been different at first instance, and should be different on appeal, if criticism with respect to one element can be sustained. 
      
       
     11 A sentencing judge, and this Court, must, in the end, be satisfied that the final sentence – both the head sentence and any non-parole period - appropriately reflect the degree of criminality involved in the offence given the particular circumstances of the offender. An error by a sentencing judge will not lead this Court to reduce a sentence where the re-exercise of the discretion would lead to no lesser result. That is the case here. 
      
       
     12 In Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [3], Gleeson CJ and Hayne J said: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is of the first importance to identify the jurisdiction which the Court of Criminal Appeal exercises, the power the Court is given, and the circumstances in which those powers may be exercised.” 
          
         
        
       
     13 In the case of New South Wales, s5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides that a person may appeal with the leave of a court against sentence. Section 6(3) provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “On an appeal under s5(1) against a sentence, the court, if it is of opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal.” 
          
         
        
       
     14 It is pertinent to note that even on a severity appeal, the Court has an express statutory power to impose another sentence “whether more or less severe” than that which is appealed from. As a matter of practice, rather than power, the Court does not increase the sentence on a severity appeal. (See Neal v The Queen (1982) 149 CLR 305.) Nevertheless, the Court must, in order to exercise its statutory power, form an opinion to the effect that “some other sentence … is warranted in law and should have been passed”. In the present case, I am of the view that the Court should not form any such opinion. 
      
       
     15 In my opinion, the appeal should be rejected. No complaint is made, nor could any such complaint be made, that the sentence itself was in any way manifestly excessive and suggestive of error. Indeed, given the objective circumstances of the offence and the substantial criminal record of the offender, I would myself regard the sentence as towards the lower end of the permissible range. The appeal should be rejected on the basis that, if this Court did quash the sentence of the District Court and came to exercise its discretion afresh, it would impose no lesser sentence than that actually imposed by the trial judge.  
      
       
     16 Furthermore, and alternatively, I would reject the bases upon which his Honour’s exercise of discretion was challenged in this Court. The Applicant identified three alleged errors in his Honour’s reasons: 
      
       
       
       (1) Failure to make sufficient allowance for the absence of remissions in this State, pursuant to s16G of the Commonwealth Crimes Act. 
        
         
        
       (2) Failure to make adequate allowance for the combined effects of the plea of guilty and the assistance provided by the Applicant. 
        
         
        
       (3) Fixing the non-parole period at 75 percent of the total sentence. 
        
       
     17 The Applicant submitted that his Honour failed to properly take into account the fact that remissions are not available in New South Wales, pursuant to s16G of the Crimes Act (Cth). His Honour indicated that a sentence of eight years was appropriate and that it would be reduced to six years having regard to s16G. There are statements in the authorities that a one-third reduction is an appropriate starting point, indeed that it is the norm. It is not, however, in any way a rule or a fixed ratio (see e.g. DPP v El Karhani (1990) 21 NSWLR 370; R v Beeforth (NSWCCA, 24 November 1995, unreported). 
      
       
     18 It is over a decade since this Court identified that the usual practice throughout Australia for remissions was something of the order of one-third. It is by no means obvious that this continues to be accurate. 
      
       
     19 In the present case, an experienced sentencing judge, who is well aware of the practice, departed from it in the exercise of his discretion. The norm should not be treated as some sort of rule or ratio applicable on a mathematical basis. It remains a question of discretion as to what the appropriate discount should be in all of the circumstances. In my opinion, his Honour was entitled to come to the view that he did. 
      
       
     20 I can see no proper basis for interfering with his Honour’s discretion in that regard. 
      
       
     21 As to the second matter, his Honour took into account the plea and assistance together, reducing the figure of six years by one-third to four years. It was submitted that this was an inadequate recognition of the value of the two elements. 
      
       
     22 This submission was based on the proposition that in R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 this Court had indicated that a discount of ten to twenty-five percent was appropriate to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea. It was submitted, correctly, that the utilitarian value of the plea in this case was high as the plea was entered at the earliest opportunity. It was submitted that in this case the Applicant was entitled to a discount at the top of the range, i.e. of twenty-five percent, and therefore the discount for assistance of only eight and a third percent was inadequate, given the trial judge’s findings that the assistance was “timely and useful”. Alternatively, the “combined discount” was inadequate. 
      
       
     23 For the reasons given in Thomson & Houlton, the Court has determined that, for New South Wales State offences, it is appropriate to quantify and separately articulate in terms of quantum the utilitarian value of a plea. This Court has not held that it is necessary to separately identify and quantify a discount in the case of Commonwealth offences. However, in R v Bugeja [2001] NSWCCA 196 at [24]-[28], Hodgson JA found that the range identified in Thomson & Houlton was a reasonable range to adopt for the purposes of Commonwealth offences. Nevertheless, the scheme of s16A of the Crimes Act (Cth) contains a somewhat different approach for Commonwealth offences. A plea of guilty is one of a list of matters required to be taken into account under s16A(2). 
      
       
     24 It is not the case that everyone who pleads guilty at the earliest opportunity must be given a twenty-five percent discount and nothing in Thomson & Houlton suggested it was. The matter remains one of discretion, not mathematical precision. To say something is permissible or appropriate is not to say that it is required. Nothing in R v Carter [2001] NSWCCA 245, to which the Applicant referred, suggests the contrary. I see no error in the trial judge assessing the combined value for the plea and assistance as a substantial discount of one-third. 
      
       
     25 Finally, it was submitted that his Honour erred in setting the non-parole period at seventy-five percent of the head sentence. The Applicant relied on the authorities which indicate that the norm for non-parole periods is in the range of about sixty to sixty-six percent of the head sentence (see e.g. R v Drazkiewicz (NSWCCA, 23 November 1993, unreported); R v Bernier (1998) 102 A Crim R 44 at 49 and R v Behar (NSWCCA, 14 October 1998, unreported)). 
      
       
     26 In the present case, the sentencing judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “… Because of his previous record and the seriousness of these offences, I set a non-parole period of three-quarters of that period, namely three years on each”. 
          
         
        
       
     27 The Applicant submitted that his Honour erred in approaching the matter in this way in that each of the matters to which his Honour referred, i.e. previous record and seriousness of offence, had already been taken into account in fixing the head sentence and, accordingly, to take into account by way of an increase in the non-parole period was, in effect, some form of double counting. 
      
       
     28 This issue has been considered by this Court recently in Bugeja. Hodgson JA said at [31]: 
      
       
        
         
         “In my opinion the circumstance that the offence as a repeat offence, and a conclusion by the sentencing Judge that the prospects of rehabilitation are small, are relevant factors in fixing the proportion for the non-parole period. In my opinion a sentencing judge is not precluded from taking those matters into account in fixing the proportion, simply because they have also been taken into account in fixing the head sentence.” 
          
         
        
       
     29 Adams J disagreed with this approach. He said at [36] and [37]: 
      
       
        
         
         “[36] So far as setting a non parole period is concerned, there can be little doubt that his Honour imposed a term whose relationship with the head sentence was well within the upper range. That head sentence had already been set with regard to the need for personal deterrence being demonstrated by the offender’s earlier convictions. Thus, if the non-parole period were to be set by reference to the conventional two-thirds relationship with the head sentence the need to deal with the issue of personal deterrence was already catered for. 
          
          
         [37] On this basis, while there might theoretically be cases where the application of the conventional relationship would produce a non parole period that was too low having regard to the objectives of sentencing law, there would be very few where this was so and the circumstances justifying a significant departure from the usual proportion would need to be comprehensively set out.” 
          
         
        
       
     30 Greg James J appears also to have expressed a view closer to that expressed by Adams J, in this respect. His Honour said at [34]: 
      
       
        
         
         “[34] For myself, I would have inclined to the view that his Honour had also fallen into error in the way in which his Honour came to assess the non-parole period, perhaps because his Honour appears, arguably, to have increased both the non parole period and the head sentence because the applicant was a repeat offender.” 
          
         
        
       
     31 In the event, his Honour did not decide the issue. 
      
       
     32 This case is distinguishable from that considered by Adams J in Bugeja. While Shadbolt DCJ acknowledged there was some prospect of rehabilitation, the head sentence in this case did not impose a term at the upper level of the appropriate range. Where, as here, a head sentence was at the lower end of the appropriate range, a larger than usual ratio for a non-parole period may, in my opinion, be appropriate. As Badgery-Parker J said in Drazkiewicz: 
      
       
        
         
         “There is no tariff which dictates what should be the non-parole period but it is important to remember in determining a non-parole period that it must be of sufficient length to ensure that the sentence reflects the criminality involved and does not lose the very important significant effect of general deterrence …” 
          
         
        
       
     33 The matter was addressed directly in a joint judgment of this Court in R v Bernier at 49 where the Court, after acknowledging that no fixed ratios were involved in matters of this character, said: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Subject to those caveats, the norm for non-parole periods is in the range of about 60 per cent to 66 and two-thirds per cent.  
         One factor which may be material is the length of the head sentence and its position in the permissible range. Circumstances may exist which make it appropriate to move outside the usual range for non-parole periods 
         . The process is not mathematical or rigid, and often requires a finely tuned assessment. The determination of the appropriate non-parole period, as of the head sentence, should be approached with the caution and flexibility enjoined by Hunt CJ at CL in  
         Lawson 
          (at 324-325; 464-465)."" 
          [Emphasis added] 
         
        
       
     34 The reference to ""flexibility"" in matters of this character must be acknowledged in all such cases because the court is dealing with the exercise of discretion. To suggest that there is some form of “double counting” involved in taking into account matters on both the head sentence and the fixing of the non-parole period is, in my opinion, to wrongly suppose that mathematical precision is involved in the sentencing exercise and to introduce an undesirable form of inflexibility into the sentencing exercise. A norm is not a rule or fixed ratio. 
      
       
     35 The appropriateness of taking into account the matter which his Honour took into account is indicated in the statutory scheme itself. Section 19AB of the Crimes Act (Cth) provides in subs (1) for the fixing of a non-parole period and in subs (3) for an exemption from that obligation. 
      
       
     36 Subsection 19AB(3) provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “Where, but for this subsection, a court would be required by this section to fix a non-parole period, or make a recognizance release order, in respect of a person, the court may decline to do either if, having regard to the nature and circumstances of the offence or offences concerned and to the antecedents of the person, the court is satisfied that neither is appropriate.” 
          
         
        
       
     37 Subsection (4) requires the Court to state and record its reasons for refusing to fix a non-parole period. 
      
       
     38 Where the legislative scheme permits a court to refuse to fix any non-parole period by reason of “the nature and circumstances of the offence … and … the antecedents of the person”, then such matters may be taken into account when fixing the relationship between the non-parole period and the head sentence. While a non-parole period of seventy-five percent will be infrequent, and indeed perhaps rare, it is not impermissible, let alone itself indicative of error.  
      
       
     39 I refer again to Bernier at 49. In R v Stitt (1998) 102 A Crim R 428 at 432, in a passage referred to with approval in R v Meloh [2001] NSWCCA 211 at par [10], the Court indicated that non-parole periods of seventy-five per cent may be ""limited to the more serious cases where the prospects of rehabilitation have not been considered good”. I do not understand that the Court was there propounding a comprehensive list of all circumstances in which a non-parole period outside the sixty to sixty-six per cent norm can be justified. Indeed, any such suggestion would be inconsistent with the reasoning in Bernier about flexibility and the specific example, directly applicable to the present case, referred to in the joint judgment of the Court.40 The Applicant also referred the Court to the decision in R v Acosta [1999] NSWCCA 334 where his Honour Kirby J, with whom Meagher JA and James J agreed, referred to a seventy-five per cent non-parole period as being ""reserved for the worst class of case"". His Honour made reference to R v Paull (1990) 20 NSWLR 427 and R v Behar. In neither of those authorities is the phrase ""worst class of case"" used.  
      
       
     41 The phrase ""worst class of case"" is terminology that is used in criminal sentencing with respect to circumstances in which the maximum penalty for an offence is appropriate. However, in that context there is a fixed, identifiable and quantified amount, to which terminology such as ""worst class of case"" is clearly appropriate. In the case of a non-parole period, on any view, there is a range of permissible percentages within which the exercise of the discretion can occur.  
      
       
     42 As I understand Kirby J, his Honour was saying that seventy-five per cent would be a rare case. What his Honour identified as a ""worst class of case"" cannot be limited to the circumstances in which a maximum penalty is imposed. Any suggestion that the Court cannot impose a ratio greater than seventy-five percent would be contrary to the express legislative provision in s19AB(3) of the Crimes Act (Cth), which permits the Court in certain circumstances not to fix a non-parole period of any kind at all. 
      
       
     43 Shadbolt DCJ identified the reasons which made him exercise the discretion in the way he did. The matters to which his Honour referred were, in my opinion, pertinent to the decision that his Honour had to make. The question of the weight that his Honour attached to those matters was a matter for his Honour. I can see no error in his Honour's exercise of the discretion. 
      
       
     44 In my opinion, leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal dismissed. 
      
       
     45 STUDDERT J: I agree with the orders proposed by the Chief Justice and I also agree with the reasons expressed by him. 
      
       
     46 IRELAND AJ: I also agree. 
      
       
     47 SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders are: Leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is dismissed.

       NOMINAL DEFENDANT v Brett Edward HALL 
        
       
      
      
      The respondent was involved in a motorcycle accident on 16 October, 1997, where he fell from his motorcycle allegedly as a result of the presence of diesel oil on the roadway negligently spilt by an unidentified motor vehicle. Conflicting evidence was given at trial by a number of parties as to the presence of oil on the road. Certoma ADCJ accepted the evidence of a number of witnesses as to presence of the oil spill. None of the witnesses had been present at the time of the accident. Some of those whose evidence was accepted had attended the scene of the accident, at the earliest, some 4 hours after it occurred. The appellant appealed the finding against it on liability.  
       
       
      Held: 
       
       
      Per Stein JA ( Sheller and Hodgson JJA agreeing): 
       
     1 It could not be shown that the trial judge failed to use or palpably misused his advantage in preferring the evidence of Cottam, Taket and Nation, nor could it be shown that he acted on evidence which was inconsistent with facts incontrovertibly established. His finding of the existence of diesel oil on the roadway was not glaringly improbable.  
     2 The trial judge did not overlook a substantial body of evidence. His treatment of the evidence of Mr Till and Constable Wiggins was open to him and the findings about the diesel oil on the roadway stand. 
     3 His Honour did not address the fact that the evidence did not establish that the diesel was on the roadway at the time of the accident. There was a complete absence of reasoning as to how it was reasonable to infer the presence of the diesel oil spill back to the time of the accident, from the evidence given. 
     4 Whether diesel oil was present on the roadway at the time of the accident was central to the respondent’s case. There was a complete absence of consideration of this critical issue. The failure to explain the basis of a crucial finding of fact constitutes a breach of the principle that justice must not only be done but be seen to be done. Mifsud v Campbell  91991) 21 NSWLR 725, Beale v Government Insurance Office of NSW (1997) 48 NSWLR 430 applied. 
      
       
      Orders: 
       
     1 Appeal allowed with costs.2 Judgment entered for the plaintiff set aside.3 The matter to be remitted to the District Court for a new trial on liability. 4 Costs of the first trial should abide the second trial5 The respondent is entitled to a certificate under the Suitors' Fund Act 1951 in respect of the costs of the appeal, if so qualified.

       NOMINAL DEFENDANT v Brett Edward HALL 
       
       
       Judgment 
        
       
     1 SHELLER JA: I have had the benefit of reading the reasons for judgment prepared by both Stein JA and Hodgson JA. I agree with what their Honours say and the orders Stein JA proposes. 
     2 STEIN JA: This is an appeal by the Nominal Defendant from a finding against it on liability by Certoma ADCJ on 17 October 2000. The appeal arises out of an accident involving the respondent, Brett Edward Hall, which occurred at Wandandian on 16 October 1997. The quantum of damages was agreed during the course of the trial, thus the court is only concerned with the issue of liability. 
     3 The plaintiff’s claim was that he fell from his motorcycle as a result of the presence on the roadway of diesel oil negligently spilt by an unidentified motor vehicle. 
     4 It is necessary to examine the facts with some care. Their ascertainment is not made any easier as a result of the plaintiff’s loss of memory of the accident and the events surrounding it. He suffered a head injury in falling from his motorcycle. Moreover, no one witnessed the accident. However, the following findings were made by his Honour which can be accepted without question. 
     5 Shortly before 7.30 pm on 16 October 1997 the plaintiff was riding his motorcycle south on the Princes Highway at Wandandian. The weather was fine and the roadway dry. When he reached a left hand bend about 500m south of the Bewong Roadhouse, the cycle travelled across the double centre lines onto its incorrect side of the road and both the plaintiff and the cycle ended up in a culvert off the road on the northbound lane. The cycle struck two posts at the side of the road. The plaintiff was unconscious when found by a truck driver who was also travelling south. No other vehicle was involved in the accident. The area was sparsely populated with few houses in the vicinity. 
     6 While the plaintiff, because of his injuries, had no recollection of the accident, we do know some facts concerning him. He was 31 years of age at the time of the accident and had been riding motorcycles for 12 years. The plaintiff was riding a Harley Davidson which he had owned for four years. He was very familiar with this section of the highway and travelled it at least four times each week. The plaintiff’s job was to collect blood samples. He was apparently wearing an open helmet at the time of the accident and had a negative blood alcohol reading. He first obtained his driving licence in 1983 and had incurred some 7 speeding offences prior to the accident. All except one of those was for exceeding the speed limit by 15 to 30 kph. His Honour found that the plaintiff was not a driver prone to motor vehicle accidents having had only one accident before (in 1991). The judge made a positive finding as to the plaintiff’s credit. 
     7 Evidence was given at the trial by three friends of the plaintiff, by Mr Till (the truck driver who found the plaintiff at the side of the road) and a police officer. 
     8 Constable Wiggins arrived at the scene at 7.45 pm when it was dark and noted that an ambulance was in attendance, which took the plaintiff to hospital. He inspected the roadway and the direction from which the motorcycle came. The officer made some brief notes and a sketch in his notebook. He said in evidence that he did not see any oil or diesel spill or stain on the roadway. 
     9 I will return to the officer’s evidence in a moment. Mr Till, who came upon the accident, went along the roadway with the officer. They had a torch and inspected the area where the motorcycle left the road. Mr Till found some gouge or scrape marks on the road and followed them to where the motorcycle had come to rest. He did not walk further to the north or south along the highway from the gouge marks. Mr Till did not see any oil spill but his Honour found that he did not walk to the area where the spill was alleged to be located. 
     10 The police officer went back to the scene the following morning after he had a conversation with Mr Kevin Taket, a friend of the plaintiff. When the officer returned to the scene, he noted a dry stain on the roadway which was either oil or diesel. It measured 1.5m in length and was 15 cm wide. It was not slippery. While he said in evidence that the stain did not line up with the gouge marks left by the motorcycle, the officer amended his notes by adding ‘oil/diesel spill’ with an arrow pointing to two parallel lines, which seem to be the area of the ‘spill’ or ‘stain’ his Honour noted that, although the diagram in the notebook was not to scale, the gouge marks indicated in the northern lane lead directly from the area of the ‘spill’.  
     11 Evidence was given by Mr Michael Cottam, who had been a friend of the plaintiff for 10 to 12 years and shared a house with him. He worked at the Bewong Roadhouse. Mr Cottam received a telephone call from someone at the roadhouse about an accident to a motorcycle resembling the plaintiff’s. He went to the scene. It was dark and the plaintiff had already been taken to hospital and the motorcycle was being removed by a tow truck. Mr Cottam went to the roadhouse and telephoned Mr Taket. Taket came and picked him up and together they went to the hospital until about 11.30 pm or so when the plaintiff was airlifted to Sydney. Cottam and Taket returned home but at about midnight decided to return to the accident scene with a torch. 
     12 Mr Cottam said that he saw a line of diesel oil and scratch marks on the road. The scratch marks ran from the diesel to where the motorcycle came to rest, that being evident from a post which had been knocked out by the cycle and another damaged post. He saw no skid or tyre marks coming out of the spill but only scrape marks on the road. 
     13 Mr Cottam described the spill as about one foot wide and in the middle of the southbound lane. He (with Mr Taket) followed the spill up the hill and around the corner. 
     14 The next day Mr Cottam returned to the scene and saw that the spill went further and came out of the roadhouse. 
     15 Mr Taket’s evidence was to similar effect and confirmed that the spill came from the roadhouse. His description of the spill was different from that of Cottam. He said it was a line of diesel 2 to 5 inches wide and 2 to 3 feet from the side of the road. It ‘looked fresh’ and when he rubbed his hand in it he had smelt that it was diesel. 
     16 When he returned with Mr Cottam the next day, they had Colleen Nation with them. She was Mr Taket’s partner. Mr Taket said that he could see the diesel trail clearer and it went 200 to 300m down the road from the corner and faded off. Mr Taket later spoke to the police, hence Constable Wiggins returned to the scene. 
     17 Ms Colleen Nation gave evidence that she went to the accident scene on the day after the accident. She described seeing a spillage at about 1.5 feet from the side of the road and that it looked like a splattered paint spill, 10 to 15cm wide. It went as far as ‘we could see’. The spill came from the roadhouse and went to the south for a few hundred metres from the bend eventually dissipating and becoming only drops. She touched the substance and it felt oily. She saw Mr Taket touch and smell it. 
     18 Clearly, the evidence regarding the diesel spill was in conflict. The credit of the witnesses on both sides was challenged. His Honour noted that he had had the benefit of hearing and observing the witnesses. He said: 
      
       
        
        The plaintiff’s friends appear to be truthful witnesses with little self interest other than supporting their friend and, understandably, seeking an explanation as to why the plaintiff, whom they consider an experienced driver, fell from his motorcycle. They did not give me the impression of any collusion between them, as was evident from the differing details in their evidence including their descriptions of the spill. However, these differences in their evidence, and in particular, their descriptions of the spill, was not of such significant difference as to make me doubt their evidence or truthfulness. These differences were in my view no more than normal differences in perception and measurement by different persons.  
        
       
     19 Turning to the appellant’s witnesses, his Honour thought that Mr Till did not venture beyond the area of the scrape marks and this could have explained his not seeing any spill. Moreover, Mr Till was not on the lookout for any spill marks on the road, unlike the police officer when he returned to the scene the next day. 
     20 His Honour then turned to the officer’s evidence. Of his evidence his Honour said: 
      
       
        
        He included in the diagram of the accident scene in his notebook an “oil/diesel spill” which he had missed on the evening of the accident but later thought it important enough to include in the diagram when he discovered the spill the next day after a conversation with Taket. Although he stated that the spill was only a stain at the time he inspected it, there certainly was some sort of spill which must have been of sufficient significance to include in the diagram. And in relation to his view that the spill or stain did not line up with the gouge marks that the motorcycle left in the road, as will become evident from the report of Schnerring that will be referred to later, this may not be material since a motorcycle may travel some distance after hitting a spill before it strikes the ground.  
        
       
     21 The trial judge thought it not unreasonable that the officer’s recollection might now be vague, or that the investigation at the time was not as thorough as it could have been, since he had initially assumed that the rider had simply come off his motorcycle. 
     22 His Honour concluded: 
      
       
        
        Considering all of these matters and my observations of the witnesses, I accept the evidence of Cottam, Taket and Nation. I therefore find that there was a wet diesel spill on the roadway; and that the spill consisted of a trail located somewhere between the middle and some 50 cm from the edge of the southbound lane and extending from the roadhouse to some distance beyond the scene of the accident until it dissipated or “faded off”. 
        
       
       
      This is a classic credibility finding. It cannot be shown that the trial judge failed to use or palpably misused his advantage, or that he acted on evidence which was inconsistent with facts incontrovertibly established. Nor that his finding of the existence of diesel on the roadway was glaringly improbable or that the evidence of Cottam and Taket to that effect was glaringly improbable. ( 
      Devries v Australian National Railways)  
      (1992 –1993) 177 CLR 472 at 479). 
       
     23 Examining the whole of the relevant evidence with care, including that of the police officer and Mr Till, does not lead to the court intervening. The appellant contends that the trial judge overlooked a substantial body of evidence and failed to give sufficient attention to the evidence of Mr Till and Constable Wiggins. I do not see how it can be said that his Honour overlooked a substantial body of evidence. His Honour had regard to the evidence of Mr Till and the officer. He distinguished Mr Till’s evidence and it cannot be said that this was not open. He did not accept the whole of the officer’s evidence and, on the crucial issue of the extent of the diesel on the roadway, he preferred the evidence of the plaintiff’s witnesses. In doing so, it cannot be said that his Honour infringed the principles laid down in the authorities. Accordingly, his Honour’s findings upon the diesel on the roadway must stand. 
     24 However, there is one particularly important aspect of the evidence of the diesel spill which his Honour did not address at all. The accident occurred at 7.30 pm but the first direct observation of diesel oil on the roadway is from Messrs Cottam and Taket at about midnight. That is, some 4 ½ hours after the accident. Their evidence did not establish that the diesel was on the roadway at the time of the accident. It was possible that the oil was deposited on the roadway at any time between 7.30 pm and midnight. Could an inference be drawn from the evidence, including the observations of Cottam and Taket, that the diesel was present on the roadway at 7.30 pm and caused the plaintiff to have the accident? This is not an issue which it appears that his Honour considered. Having preferred the observations of the plaintiff’s witnesses about the existence of diesel oil on the roadway, his Honour simply found that ‘there was a wet diesel spill on the roadway’. Assuming this finding implies that the diesel was present at the time of the accident, there is a complete absence of reasoning as to how it was reasonable to infer back 4 ½ hours from midnight. 
     25 It was clearly a critical issue that the diesel oil be found to be on the roadway at the time of the accident at 7.30 pm. It was central to the plaintiff’s case. Mere acceptance of the plaintiff’s witnesses that the oil was there 4 ½ hours later does not provide evidence of the critical issue unless proper inferences can be drawn. 
     26 In Mifsud v Campbell (1991) 21 NSWLR 725 at 728 Samuels JA, referring to McHugh JA in Soulmezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Ltd (1987) 10 NSWLR 247 at 281, noted that a failure to explain the basis of a crucial finding of fact involves a breach of the principle that justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done. He went on to state that: 
      
       
        
        … it is an incident of judicial duty for the judge to consider all the evidence in the case. It is plainly unnecessary for a judge to refer to all the evidence led in the proceedings or to indicate which of it is accepted or rejected. The extent of the duty to record the evidence given and the findings made depend, as the duty to give reasons does, upon the circumstances of the individual case. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        Accordingly, a failure to refer to some of the evidence does not necessarily, whenever it occurs, indicate that the judge has failed to discharge the duty which rests upon him or her. However,  
        for a judge to ignore evidence critical to an issue in a case 
         and contrary to an assertion of fact made by one party and accepted by the judge… may promote a sense of grievance in the adversary and create a litigant who is not only “disappointed” but “disturbed” – to use the words which appear in the New Zealand case of  
        Connell v Auckland City Council 
         [1977] 1 NZLR 630 at 634. It tends to deny both the fact and the appearance of justice having been done. If it does, as in my opinion is the case here,  
        then it will have worked a miscarriage of justice and have produced a mis-trial and resulted in what I would take to be an error of law which is reviewable on appeal. 
         Whether it is an error of law or an error of fact, it seems to me a failure by the judge to do what the nature of the office requires. (at 728) [my emphasis] 
        
       
     27 The principle of justice being done and being seen to be done was discussed by Meagher JA in Beale v Government Insurance Office of NSW (1997) 48 NSWLR 430. He said at 443-444: 
      
       
        
        … reasons need not necessarily be lengthy or elaborate: 
        Ex parte Powter: Re Powter 
         (1945) 46 SR (NSW) 1 at 5; 63 WN (NSW) 34 at 36. The scope of the reasons to be given is, as Mahoney JA said in  
        Housing Commission of New South Wales v Tatmar Pastoral Co Pty Ltd  
        [1983] 3 NSWLR 378 at 386, related “… to the function to be served by the giving of reasons”. Accordingly, the content of the obligation is not the same for every judicial decision. No mechanical formula can be given in determining what reasons are required. However, there are three fundamental elements of a statement of reasons, which it is useful to consider. First, a judge should refer to relevant evidence. There is no need to refer to the relevant evidence in detail, especially in circumstances where it is clear that the evidence has been considered. However, where certain evidence is important or critical to the proper determination of the matter and it is not referred to by the trial judge, an appellate court may infer that the trial judge overlook the evidence or failed to give consideration to it:  
        North Sydney Council v Ligon 302 Pty Ltd 
         (1995) 87 LGERA 435. Where conflicting evidence of a significant nature is given, the existence of both sets of evidence should be referred to. 
        
       
       
        
        Secondly, a judge should set out any material findings of fact and any conclusions or ultimate findings of fact reached. The obvious extension of the principles in  
        North Sydney Council 
         is that, where findings of fact are not referred to, an appellate court may infer that the trial judge considered that finding to be immaterial… But that is not to say that a judge must make explicit findings on each disputed piece of evidence, especially if the inference as to what is found is appropriately clear:  
        Selvanayagam v University of the West Indies 
         [1983] 1 WLR 585; [1983] 1 All ER 824… 
        
       
       
        
        Thirdly, a judge should provide reasons for making the relevant findings of fact (and conclusions) and reasons in applying the law to the facts found. Those reasons or the process of reasoning should be understandable and preferably logical as well. 
         
        Whilst it is desirable to address these elements in giving reasons for the decision, it is the purpose which the reasons serve which assumes primary importance in determining the content of the reasons. That purpose must be weighed against other considerations…On the one hand, the provision of inadequate reasons can lead to a sense of injustice and a reduced appreciation or understanding of legal rights and obligations. On the other hand, an overly onerous duty to provide reasons increases costs and delay in the judicial system which has the effect of undermining public confidence…In the end, the balancing act which needs to be undertaken in considering the sufficiency of a statement of reasons involves the adoption of, at the least, a minimum standard which places the parties in a position to understand why the decision was made sufficiently to allow them to exercise any right of appeal. 
        
       
       
        
        … an appeal court will reserve any intervention to those situations in which it is left with no choice: where no reasons have been given in circumstances where there was an obligation to provide them and in circumstances where a statement of reasons is so inadequate as to constitute a miscarriage of justice… 
        
       
       
        
        Another question, which need not presently be decided, is whether the failure to provide reasons or the provision of inadequate reasons constitutes either an error of law or some other appealable error. This was a question which Hope A-JA noted but found unnecessary to decide in  
        Mifsud v Campbell  
         (at 729). It is sufficient to note that most cases have assumed the error is one of law. 
        
       
     28 Whether it could be reasonably inferred from the acceptance of Cottam and Taket that the diesel was present at midnight, that it was present at the time of the accident, required consideration. On an examination of the whole of the evidence, that inference may have been open. However, we are left with a complete absence of consideration of this critical issue. Accordingly, it is my opinion that a new trial must be ordered on the issue of liability. The Court of Appeal is not in a position to substitute a finding one way or the other. 
     29 It follows from my conclusion that the court does not need to address the issues in the remainder of the appeal, in particular the issues of causation and contributory negligence. Indeed, in the circumstances of a new trial, it would be preferable to make no comment. 
     30 Accordingly, I would propose that the appeal be allowed with costs and the judgment entered for the plaintiff set aside. A new trial is ordered on liability. The costs of the first trial should abide the second trial. If qualified, the respondent is entitled to a certificate under the Suitors’ Fund Act 1951 in respect of the costs of the appeal. 
     31 HODGSON JA: I agree with the orders proposed by Stein JA. 
     32 If the ultimate question in this case were whether or not there was a substantial quantity of diesel fuel on the road in the vicinity of the accident at about midnight on 16th October, the primary judge’s decision in favour of this proposition could not have been challenged. 
     33 However, the relevant issues in this case were whether or not there was such a quantity of diesel fuel on the road at about 7.30 pm on 16th October, whether or not this caused the plaintiff’s accident, and whether or not it was due to the negligence of an owner or driver or a motor vehicle in the use of operation of that vehicle. 
     34 The presence of a substantial quantity of diesel fuel on the road at midnight, coupled with the occurrence of the accident, could have supported an inference that the fuel was there at 7.30 pm and caused the accident. However, quite apart from the passage of 4 ½ hours, there were substantial factors against the drawing of such an inference, in particular the apparent non-detection of the fuel by Constable Wiggins and Mr. Till at 7.45 pm, and Mr Cottam’s evidence that there were no skid or tyre marks coming out of the spill (and the absence of any evidence of smearing of the spill in the direction of the crash). 
     35 As observed by Stein JA, the primary judge gave no consideration to whether or not the inference should be drawn. Accordingly, there would need to be a new trial, subject to the following. 
     36 For the appellant, it was submitted that, even if such an inference could be drawn, it could not be inferred that the presence of the spill was due to the negligence of the owner or driver of a motor vehicle. There was some evidence that it could have been caused by a driver overriding the automatic cut-off of the diesel pump at a nearby garage, and thereby putting a quantity of fuel into the cavity under the flap over the pipe leading to the fuel tank; but it was submitted for the appellant that it was inconceivable that this could have caused such an extensive spill. 
     37 For my part, I agree with that submission. But I think the presence of diesel fuel in the quantity and location described by the plaintiffs’ witnesses could support an inference that an owner or driver of a motor vehicle, by itself or its agent, had been negligent without the necessity of specifying the exact mechanism by which tis occurred. For that reason, in my opinion this Court cannot enter a verdict for the appellant on this basis. 
     38 There is some doubt in my mind as to whether both the inferences I have identified can be drawn with sufficient assurance to discharge the civil onus of proof in relation to the whole of what the plaintiff must prove (relevantly, negligence and causation of damage); but I think the better view is that this is possible, so that there must be a new trial, as proposed by Stein JA.

       REGINA v Christopher Mark PORTER 
        
       
       
      On 3 December 1998 the Appellant arrived at the Ansett terminal at Mascot having flown to Sydney from Western Australia. New South Wales police had information which caused them to be at the airport when the Appellant arrived. He was arrested and his bags searched. The bag was found to contain $150,000. The Appellant was charged with having “goods in custody” in contravention of s527C of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900 (NSW). He was convicted before a magistrate. 
      
      
      The Appellant appealed to the District Court. At the commencement of the appeal the State Director of Public Prosecutions (“DPP”) took over the conduct of the proceedings on behalf of the Crown pursuant to ss9 and 10 of the  
      Director of Public Prosecutions Act 
       1986 (NSW) (“the DPP Act”). The Appellant then raised a number of issues to be decided prior to the hearing of the appeal. Ainslie-Wallace DCJ reached conclusions on each issue adverse to the Appellant. The Appellant appealed by way of Stated Case from her Honour’s decision.

      1 The  
      Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act 
       1970 (Cth) (“the Commonwealth Places Act”) is a valid law of the Commonwealth. It does not “delegate” the Commonwealth’s exclusive legislative power to the States.  
      R v Holmes 
       (1988) 93 FLR 405 applied. 
      
      
      2 The effect of s4 of the Commonwealth Places Act is to enact Commonwealth law in the same terms as each State which falls within its terms. Any offence created by such a law is a Commonwealth offence.  
      R v Pinkstone 
       [2001] WASC 172 referred to. 
      
      
      3 Though the Appellant’s charge did not specify that he was charged with an offence against s527C of the  
      Crimes Act  
      “as applied by s4 of the Commonwealth Places Act”, there was no relevant defect in the charge. The proceedings could be conducted on this charge either pursuant to s12(1) or by application of s14 of the Commonwealth Places Act.  
      R v Holmes 
      ,  
      R v Pinkstone 
       referred to. 
      
      
      4 Section 24 of the DPP Act does not represent a mini-code with respect to State DPP prosecution of Commonwealth offences. Section 24 does not operate as an implied repeal of the Arrangement between the State and the Commonwealth made pursuant to s6(2) of the Commonwealth Places Act. There is a strong presumption that a legislature in a federal system would not alter a statute that forms part of a collaborative and uniform national scheme, save in express terms. 
      
      
      5 The Commonwealth Parliament did not intend to confer an exclusive power on the Commonwealth DPP to conduct proceedings with respect to Commonwealth offences in Commonwealth places. The NSW DPP had standing to respond to the appeal.  
      
      
      6 The powers of arrest and search contained in ss352 and 357E of the  
      Crimes Act 
       are a “power or … function” within both s6(2) of the Commonwealth Places Act and the Agreement. The State police were authorised to act as they did in this case. 
      
      
      7 By force of s4(1) of the Commonwealth Places Act, s527C of the  
      Crimes Act 
       operates as a Commonwealth law. Accordingly, no inconsistency under s109 of the Constitution arises between s527C and s82 of the  
      Proceeds of Crime Act 
       1987 (Cth).

       REGINA v Christopher Mark PORTER 
        
        
       JUDGMENT 
       
     1 SPIGELMAN CJ: This is an appeal by way of a case stated by Ainslie-Wallace DCJ pursuant to s5B of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). The relevant facts are as follows. 
     2 On 3 December 1998, the Appellant, Christopher Mark Porter, arrived at the Ansett terminal at Mascot, having flown to Sydney from Western Australia. New South Wales police had information about the Appellant which caused them to be at the airport when he arrived. The Appellant was arrested and his bags were searched. The bag was found to contain $150,000 in Australian currency. 
     3 The Appellant was charged with having currency in his possession which was reasonably suspected of being stolen, or otherwise unlawfully obtained (“goods in custody”) pursuant to s527C(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). He was convicted on 6 October 1999 before a magistrate. In those proceedings, the informant, a member of the New South Wales Police Service, was represented by a police prosecutor. 
     4 The Appellant lodged an appeal to the District Court. At the commencement of the hearing of the appeal, the solicitor representing the Crown filed in Court a notice under ss9 and 10 of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986 (NSW) (“the DPP Act”). The effect of such a notice is to inform a court that proceedings which, having been instituted by a person other than the Director of Public Prosecutions (“DPP”), are to be continued by the DPP. 
     5 After the notice, the Appellant raised a number of legal issues to be decided prior to the hearing of the appeal. One of those issues was a challenge to the standing of the DPP to respond to the appeal. Submissions were heard on that argument and the matter was reserved for judgment. In the intervening period, the Solicitor General, on behalf of the Attorney General of New South Wales, appeared and made submissions. There was then a further hearing on the issue of the DPP’s standing and, in addition, the balance of the matters raised by the Appellant were dealt with.  
     6 There was no dispute that the Appellant was arrested in possession of the currency in a Commonwealth place. The case was commenced and conducted before the magistrate as if it were a matter under New South Wales legislation. It was conceded before Ainslie-Wallace DCJ that s14 of the Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act 1970 (Cth) (“the Commonwealth Places Act”) had the effect of making the charge and prosecution of the Appellant one under the provisions of the Crimes Act as applied. 
     7 Four issues were raised: 
      
       
      (i) The validity of the Commonwealth Places Act; 
       
       
      (ii) Whether pursuant to s4(13) and s4(14) of the Commonwealth Places Act State police have no power of search and arrest in Commonwealth places; 
       
       
      (iii) The standing of the New South Wales DPP to respond to the appeal; and 
       
       
      (iv) Whether there was an inconsistency between section 527C of the  
      Crimes Act 
       and section 82 of the  
      Proceeds of Crime Act 
       1987 (Cth). 
       
     8 Ainslie-Wallace DCJ dealt with each of the issues. In each case her Honour reached conclusions adverse to the Appellant. The Appellant appeals by way of Stated Case from her Honour’s decision. 
     9 Paragraph [5] of the Stated Case is: 
      
       
        
        “The matter to be determined by the Court is whether my determination was erroneous in point of law.” 
         
        
       
     10 The reference to “my determination” is a reference to each of the matters which Her Honour said in par [3] of the Stated Case that she had “determined”, namely the four issues I have set out in par [7] hereof: 
      
       
        
        “3 GROUNDS FOR DETERMINATION 
         
         
        As to (i) 
         
         
        I determined that the Act was valid relying upon R v Holmes (1998) 93 FLR 405, a decision of the South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal which, in turn, relied upon US v Sharpnack 355 US 286 (1958). 
         
         
        As to (ii) 
         
         
        I determined that State police have the power of search and arrest in Commonwealth places by virtue of s.4(1) of the Act which applies ss.357E and 352, Crimes Act. Sections 4(13) and (14) of the Act were not relevant to my determination. I further determined that, to the extent that it might be suggested that s.4(1) of the Act only applied to substantive law and not to the duties and powers necessary for the exercise of that power, the arrangement under s.6(2) of the Act published in the Gazette of 30 September 1971 was a complete answer. 
         
         
        As to (iii) 
         
         
        I determined that the DPP had standing to respond to the appeal under s.6(2) of the Act (see arrangement referred to above). I rejected an argument that s.24 of the DPP Act precluded the DPP conducting the appeal and distinguished Bond v The Queen (2000) 169 ALR 607 on the basis that it related to a ‘federal appeal’ whereas the offence was a State offence not a federal offence. 
         
         
        As to (iv) 
         
         
        I determined that there was no legislative intention in the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 (Cth) to cover the field to the exclusion of s.527C, Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) so that s.4(2)(a) of the Act did not preclude s.527C applying under s.4(1) of the Act.” 
        
       
     11 Paragraph [4] of the Stated Case is headed “Appellant’s Contention” and says: 
      
       
        
        “The Appellant contends that my determination was erroneous in point of law upon the following grounds: 
         
         
        (1) I erred in finding that the Act was valid (judgment, pages 2-4). 
         
         
        (2) (a) I erred in finding that s.357E, Crimes Act applied in respect of arrests for Commonwealth offences. 
         
         
          
          (b) I erred in finding that s.352, Crimes Act applied in respect of arrests for Commonwealth offences. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) I erred in finding that ss.4(13) and 4(14) of the Act played no part in these circumstances. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) I erred in finding that the charge preferred against the appellant was not a federal offence. 
         
         
        (4) I erred in finding that that there was no inconsistency between s.527C, Crimes Act and s.82, Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 (Cth).” 
         
        
       
     12 The issue for this Court is to decide whether her Honour erred in any of the respects identified in par [4] of the Stated Case and, if so, whether the error resulted in any, and if so which, of the “determinations” set out in par [3] of the Stated Case being wrong in law. 
      
       
       
      The Statutory Regime 
     13 The Commonwealth Places Act was enacted after the decisions of the High Court in Worthing v Rowell and Muston Pty Ltd (1970) 123 CLR 89 and The Queen v Phillips (1970) 125 CLR 93. The effect of those two decisions was that the States did not have power to pass legislation which had effect within places acquired by the Commonwealth for public purposes, by reason of the exclusive legislative power in s52(i) of the Constitution. Accordingly, a State could not prosecute a person for an offence against State law if it was committed in a Commonwealth place. 
     14 The principal operative provision of the Commonwealth Places Act is s4(1): 
      
       
        
        “4(1) The provisions of the laws of a State as in force at a time (whether before or after the commencement of this Act) apply, or shall be deemed to have applied, in accordance with their tenor, at that time in and in relation to each place in that State that is or was a Commonwealth place at that time.” 
         
        
       
     15 Sections 4(13) and 4(14) are: 
      
       
        
        “4(13) Without limiting the effect of any of the preceding provisions of this section, it is declared that the powers of a person under the applied provisions may be exercised in a Commonwealth place in a State in respect of an act done in that State notwithstanding that the act was not done in or in relation to that place and the applied provisions as having effect in or in relation to that place have effect in relation to anything done by a person in the exercise of a power referred to in this subsection. 
         
         
        (14) Without limiting the effect of any other law of the Commonwealth, it is declared that the powers of a person under the law of a State may be exercised in that State in respect of an act done in that State notwithstanding that the act was done in or in relation to a Commonwealth place and the provisions of the laws of the State have effect in relation to anything done by a person in the exercise of a power referred to in this subsection.” 
         
        
       
     16 Section 12(1) of the Act states: 
      
       
        
        “12(1) Subject to this Act, proceedings (whether civil or criminal and whether original or appellate) under any part of the applied provisions shall be instituted and conducted in the same manner as though they were proceedings under the law of the State to which that part corresponds and all other proceedings in relation to any such proceedings (including declining to proceed further in a prosecution) shall also be taken as though the first-mentioned proceedings were proceedings under that law.” 
        
       
     17 Section14 states: 
      
       
        
        “14 Where a person is charged with an offence against a law of a State and the court before which he is charged is satisfied that: 
         
         
          
          (a) that law is inapplicable by reason of the operation of section 52 of the Constitution in relation to Commonwealth places; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) a part of the applied provisions corresponds to that law; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        the proceedings shall be continued as though that person had been charged with the corresponding offence under that part of the applied provisions.” 
         
        
       
     18 Section 7 states, relevantly: 
      
       
        
        “7(1) The several courts of a State are, within the limits of their several jurisdictions, whether those limits are as to subject matter or otherwise, but disregarding any limitation that exists by reason of a place being a Commonwealth place, invested with federal jurisdiction in all matters arising under the applied provisions as having, or as having had, effect in or in relation to a Commonwealth place.” 
        
       
     19 “Commonwealth place” is defined in s3 to be: 
      
       
        
        “a place (not being the seat of government) with respect to which the Parliament, by virtue of section 52 of the Constitution, has, subject to the Constitution, exclusive power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth”. 
         
        
       
     20 The scheme makes express provision for the execution of State laws which are applied to Commonwealth places. Section 6(2) of the Commonwealth Places Act provides: 
      
       
        
        “6(2) The Governor-General may make an arrangement with the Governor of a State for or in relation to the exercise or performance of a power, duty or function (not being a power, duty or function involving the exercise of judicial power) by an authority of the State under the applied provisions having effect in or in relation to a Commonwealth place in that State and, where such an arrangement is in force, the power, duty or function may or shall, as the case may be, be exercised or performed accordingly.” 
         
        
       
     21 An Arrangement pursuant to s6(2) between the Commonwealth and the State of New South Wales was gazetted on 30 September 1971. The Arrangement states: 
      
       
        
        “… where, under a law of the State to which a part of the applied provisions corresponds, an authority (as defined in the Act and in the State Act) of the State (not being a court) may or shall, as the case may be, exercise or perform any power, duty or function (not being a power, duty or function involving the exercise of judicial power), the corresponding power, duty or function under that part of the applied provisions may or shall, as the case may be, be exercised or performed by that authority.” (Commonwealth of Australia Gazette, No. 91, 30 September 1971, Australian Government Publishing Service, at 6160) 
        
       
     22 The word “authority” is defined in s3 to mean, inter alia: 
      
       
        
        “(d) a body created by or under the law of the State; and 
         
         
        (e) an officer or an employee of the State or of a body referred to in the last preceding paragraph;” 
         
        
       
     23 Furthermore, s10 of the Commonwealth Places Act provides: 
      
       
        
        “10 Where an authority of a State or a person has purported to do an act under a law of a State in or in relation to a Commonwealth place and: 
         
         
          
          (a) that law is inapplicable by reason of the operation of section 52 of the Constitution in relation to that Commonwealth place; and 
           
           
          (b) a part of the applied provisions corresponded to that law; 
           
          
         
        that act shall be deemed to have been done under that part of the applied provisions. 
         
        
       
     24 The New South Wales Parliament passed complementary legislation in the Commonwealth Places (Administration of Laws) Act 1970 (“the State Act”). Sections 4 and 5 of the State Act relevantly provide: 
      
       
        
        “4(1) Where, under a law of the State, provision is made for or in relation to the exercise or performance of a power duty or function by an Authority of the State and under the applied provisions, provision is made for or in relation to the exercise or performance of a like power duty or function, the Governor may make an arrangement with the Governor-General of the Commonwealth for the exercise or performance of that power duty or function under the applied provisions by an Authority of the State in and in relation to Commonwealth places as provided in the arrangement. 
         
         
        (2) The Governor may make an arrangement with the Governor-General with respect to any matter necessary or convenient for the purpose of carrying out or giving effect to the Commonwealth Act in or in relation to the State. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        5 Notwithstanding the provisions of any law of the State, an Authority may - 
         
         
          
          (a) exercise or perform the powers or functions that it or he is empowered to exercise or perform under the Commonwealth Act; and 
           
          
         
        
       
     (b) act in any office or capacity in accordance with the provisions of an arrangement in force under section 4, 
      
       
        
         
          
         
        in addition to carrying out its or his duties under the laws of the State.” 
         
        
       
      The Validity of the Commonwealth Act 
     25 The Appellant contends that the Commonwealth Places Act is invalid because it delegates the exclusive power to legislate to the State. This argument was rejected by the South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Holmes (1988) 93 FLR 405. Ainslie-Wallace DCJ applied that decision. An argument to like effect had been rejected by a majority of the Supreme Court of the United States in United States v Sharpnack 355 US 286 (1958). 
     26 The basic principle against delegation is well established (see Cobb & Co Ltd v Kropp [1967] 1 AC 141 at 154-8). As Scalia J said in Mistretta v United States 488 US 361 (1989): 
      
       
        
        “Strictly speaking, there is  
        no 
         acceptable delegation of legislative power. As John Locke put it almost 300 years ago ‘[t]he power of the  
        legislative  
        being derived from the people by a positive voluntary grant and institution, can be no other, than what the positive grant conveyed, which being only to make  
        laws 
        , and not to make  
        legislators 
        , the  
        legislative 
         can have no power to transfer their authority of making laws, and place it in other hands.’ J. Locke, Second Treatise of Government 87 (R. Cox ed. 1982) (emphasis added). Or as we have less epigrammatically said: ‘That Congress cannot delegate legislative power to the President is a principle universally recognized as vital to the integrity and maintenance of the system of government ordained by the Constitution.’ Field v. Clark, [148 US 649 (1892)], at 692.” (at 419-420) 
        
       
     27 In this Court, as in the District Court, the Appellant submitted that Holmes should not be followed and relied on the reasoning of the dissentients in Sharpnack (Douglas J and Black J). This Court should follow the decision of a Court of Criminal Appeal in another State when dealing with a Commonwealth law, unless satisfied that the reasoning is plainly wrong. (Australian Securities Commission v Marlborough Gold Mines Ltd (1992-1993) 177 CLR 485 at 492.) Far from being so satisfied, I agree with the reasoning in Holmes. Indeed, as pointed out in Holmes, the legislative solution to the lacuna had been suggested in general terms by three of their Honours in Worthing v Rowell (see supra at 103 per Barwick CJ; at 120 per Menzies J and at 132 per Windeyer J). 
     28 The Commonwealth Places Act does not “delegate” the Commonwealth’s exclusive power to make laws for Commonwealth places. It constitutes an exercise of that power in a particular manner. 
     29 Indeed the Commonwealth Parliament has made clear the retention by the Commonwealth of its control over the application of State laws by enacting s4(6) which provides: 
      
       
        
        “The regulations may provide that such of the provisions referred to in subsection (1) of this section as are specified in the regulations do not apply, or shall be deemed not to have applied, by reason of this section or so apply, or shall be deemed to have so applied, with such modifications as are specified in the regulations.” 
        
       
     30 In Holmes, King CJ said: 
      
       
        
        “It is a fundamental principle of constitutional law that Parliament cannot effectively divest itself of its sovereign legislative power, nor assign or transfer or abrogate that power, and in that sense it cannot abdicate its legislative power: Cobb & Co Ltd v Kropp [1967] 1 AC 141 at 157. The Parliament is entitled, however, to use any machinery considered appropriate for carrying out its purposes, Cobb & Co Ltd v Kropp, and ‘has, within its ambit, full power to frame its laws in any fashion, using any agent, any agency, any machinery that in its wisdom it thinks fit, for the peace, order and good government of Australia’: Baxter v Ah Way (1909) 8 CLR 626 at 646, per Isaacs J. The machinery chosen by the legislature for present purposes is the application to a Commonwealth place of the body of law existing from time to time in the State in which the place is located. There is no relinquishment or abdication of power. The Parliament may amend or repeal the Act and replace it with a new body of law, at any time. There is no inconsistency with the grant of exclusive legislative power in s 52(i); the Parliament has exercised that exclusive power by providing for the body of law which is to apply 
        . (at 406-407) 
        
       
     31 King CJ concluded: 
      
       
        
        “I see no reason why the Commonwealth Parliament cannot lawfully exercise its exclusive legislative authority with respect to Commonwealth places by applying to those places State law as it exists from time to time. … [The Commonwealth Places Act] is a valid exercise of the legislative power conferred on the Parliament of the Commonwealth by s 52(i) of the Constitution.”  
        (at 409) 
        
       
     32 To similar effect is the reasoning of Bollen J: 
      
       
        
        “… Parliament … has abdicated nothing. It has exercised its power in a particular way following a suggestion of some justices of the High Court. It has acted itself. … It is a direct exercise of its powers by the Commonwealth and in no sense an abdication at all.”  
        (at 412-413) 
        
       
     33 I agree with King CJ and Bollen J. Her Honour was correct to apply this reasoning.  
     34 The Appellant’s contention 4(1) should be rejected, and her Honour’s determination 3(i) should be upheld. 
      
       
      A “Commonwealth” or “State” Offence 
     35 Ainslie-Wallace DCJ concluded:  
      
       
        
        “The effect of section 4(1) is to apply state laws according to their ‘tenor’. The appellant is charged with a state offence and this appeal is against a conviction for a state offence under the applied provisions and said to have been committed in a Commonwealth place. It is not a federal offence, section 4(1) makes that clear”. 
         
        
       
     36 The Appellant submitted that the basis of the scheme under the Commonwealth Places Act was that that State laws are applied as Commonwealth laws. Accordingly, the only “potential” offence was a “federal offence” under the applied provision of s527C(1)(a) of the Crimes Act. The Appellant submitted that at no time was his charge amended “to provide for its federal status”. 
     37 The Solicitor General conceded that if when her Honour said “It is not a federal offence” her Honour meant that the source of the authority of the offence was not federal, then her Honour was in error. However, the Solicitor General submitted that when read in context, that is not what her Honour meant. It was submitted that her Honour’s statement merely recognised that s4(1) requires the court to construe the applied provisions “so that their character is not changed by reason of the operation of the Act”. This is because the State laws are applied “according to their tenor”. 
     38 The Solicitor General submitted that though it would have been “more accurate” to describe the offence as a charge under s527C(1) “as applied” by the Commonwealth Places Act, it had no effect in this case as the alleged error was not fundamental. The Solicitor General referred to R v Pinkstone [2001] WASC 172. 
     39 In Pinkstone, Roberts-Smith J at [23]: 
      
       
        
        “Whilst State laws are applied to such places by virtue of s4 of the Commonwealth Places Act, they apply as Commonwealth law. It follows that the present offences are Commonwealth offences and the trial of them is an exercise by this Court of federal jurisdiction.” 
        
       
     40 His Honour reiterated the proposition at [91], after referring to submissions made to him: 
      
       
        
        “His contention is quite simply that s14 of the Commonwealth Places Act dictates that the proceedings, initiated as they have been by a State prosecutor on a State indictment, but charging an offence which can only be one under the applied provisions, must continue as a prosecution of Commonwealth offence in the exercise by this Court of federal jurisdiction. I accept that submission.” 
         
        
       
      In oral submissions the Solicitor General accepted this as a correct statement.  
       
     41 I agree with Roberts-Smith J. The effect of s4 of the Commonwealth Places Act is to enact a Commonwealth law in the same terms as each State law which falls within its terms. Insofar as offences are created by such a law, they are Commonwealth offences. The phrase “according to its tenor” in s4 does not in any way prevent the transmogrification of a State law into a Commonwealth law. Any State law which is “applied” or is “deemed to have applied” by s4 becomes a Commonwealth law. 
     42 Numerous provisions of the Commonwealth Places Act and of the State Act describe the “applied provisions” as “corresponding” to the State laws. (See e.g. the Commonwealth Places Act ss4(9), 4(10), 4(11), 10 and 12; the State Act ss8, 9, 10 and 12.) That is an appropriate description of the relationship between the Commonwealth law and the State law which has been applied. 
     43 Her Honour distinguished between “a state offence under the applied provisions” and a “federal offence”. This reasoning is, in my opinion, erroneous. The offence was an offence under Commonwealth law. However, to conclude that her Honour erred in finding that “the charge … was not a federal offence” under par [4(3)] of the Stated Case, does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that any “determination” made by her Honour, as set out in par [3] of the Stated Case, was erroneous in point of law. 
      
       
      Defect in the Charge 
     44 The Appellant also submitted that the charge was defective because of the omission from that charge of an express reference to the fact that s527C of the Crimes Act operated as a Commonwealth law. He submitted that the charge should, after reference to the State section, have used words such as “as applied by s4 of the Commonwealth Places Act”. He submitted that these words represented an essential element of a Commonwealth offence and accordingly the charge did not disclose an offence known to the law. 
     45 It is not clear to me that this issue arises under the Stated case. It is, however, capable of being disposed of shortly in either of two ways: applying s12 or s14 of the Commonwealth Places Act. 
     46 I have set out above s12 of the Commonwealth Places Act. A charge in the form of a State offence appears to me to be the “institution” of proceedings, “in the same manner as though they were proceedings under the law of the State” within s12. 
     47 With respect to s14, in Holmes, King CJ said in reasoning which I should follow and with which, in any event, I entirely agree: 
      
       
        
        “There is no doubt that the offence would have been more accurately described if the count in the Information had alleged that the offence occurred in a Commonwealth place, namely Adelaide Airport, and had referred to the section of the Narcotic and Psychotropic Drugs Act 1934 (SA) as having been applied by the federal Act. Whether, apart from express statutory provision, that defect would have been fatal to the conviction need not be determined because the situation is provided for by s14 of the Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act. … 
         
         
        The point was raised before the trial judge who was referred to s14. He allowed the proceedings to continue as though the appellant had been charged under the federal law. He was correct to do so as there could be no doubt that s5(2)(c) of the Narcotic and Psychotropic Drugs Act is a law that is inapplicable to the Adelaide Airport by reason of s 52 of the Commonwealth Constitution but as ‘part of the applied provisions corresponds to that law’.” (at 409) 
         
        
       
     48 R v Pinkstone was an application to quash an indictment. The applicant was charged with supplying and attempting to supply prohibited drugs in contravention of s6(1)(c) and s33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1981 (WA). The offences were said to have occurred at Perth Airport. 
     49 Roberts-Smith J referred to s14 and s15 of the Act and their effect with respect to prosecutions of offences under the Act and said: 
      
       
        
        [89] … As I am satisfied the Misuse of Drugs Act (WA) and the Criminal Code (WA) are inapplicable to Perth Airport by reason of the operation of s52 of the Constitution in relation to Commonwealth places, but are part of the applied provisions and so correspond to those laws, the effect of s14 is mandatory: the proceedings ‘shall be continued’ as though these accused had been charged with the corresponding offence under those parts of the applied provisions. 
         
         
        [90] As the South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal said in Holmes, the present offences would have been more accurately described if the indictment had alleged the offences occurred in a Commonwealth place, namely Perth Airport, and had referred to the relevant sections of the Misuse of Drugs Act (WA) as having been applied by s4(1) of the Commonwealth Places Act, as was done in Tucs v Algie (supra). The form is not uncommon; it is used for instance in proceedings relating to charges of a ‘territory offence’ under s61(1) of the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 (Cth). Nonetheless, although such a formulation here would have been preferable, the lack of it is not fatal for the reasons given in Holmes and Willoughby. 
         
         
        [91] I was informed by Mr Cock QC that the Commonwealth/State Agreement under s6(2) of the Commonwealth Places Act referred to in Willoughby and published in the ‘Commonwealth Government Gazette’ No 91 of 30 September 1971 at 6161 (exhibit A) (‘the Commonwealth/State Agreement’) is still operative. However, he expressly disavowed any reliance upon that here. His contention is quite simply that s14 of the Commonwealth Places Act dictates that the proceedings, initiated as they have been by a State prosecutor on a State indictment, but charging an offence which can only be one under the applied provisions, must continue as a prosecution of Commonwealth offences in the exercise by this Court of federal jurisdiction. I accept that submission.” 
        
       
     50 I agree with the analysis of King CJ and of Roberts-Smith J. I have set out s14 above. The Commonwealth offence created by s4(1) is an “applied provision” which “corresponds” with s527C of the State Act. By force of s14, proceedings are to be “continued” as if the Appellant “had been charged” with the Commonwealth offence. The Appellant’s contention in this respect should be rejected. 
      
       
      Powers of the State DPP 
     51 The legal error with respect to the characterisation of the proceedings as not involving a “federal offence” occurred in the course of her Honour dealing with issue (iii) i.e. the challenge to the standing of the State DPP. 
     52 Section 24 of the DPP Act refers to the capacity of officers of the DPP to conduct Commonwealth matters. It provides: 
      
       
        
        “If an Officer, with the consent of the Attorney General, holds an appointment, commission or authority to prosecute offences against laws of the Commonwealth, the Officer may institute and conduct (in accordance with the terms of the appointment, commission or authority) prosecutions for such offences.” 
         
        
       
     53 The Appellant submitted that the conduct of appeals was a distinct step in litigation (referring to Bond v The Queen (2000) 201 CLR 213). He submitted that ss8, 9 and 10 of the DPP Act contained ideas and processes relating to prosecutions and not to appeals. That submission must be rejected. Sections 9(1)(b), (c) and (d) expressly authorise the DPP to conduct appeals in matters that he or she has “taken over”. 
     54 The Appellant submitted that s24 “covered the field” of State DPP conduct of Commonwealth matters and that ss8, 9 and 10 do not apply to s24. Although the Appellant invoked terminology from s109 constitutional jurisprudence, the essential submission was that s24 represented a mini-code within the DPP Act with respect to the institution of proceedings for Commonwealth offences. 
     55 On that basis, the Appellant submitted that to the extent that the State Act and the Arrangement under s6(2) of the Act consented to the exercise by “Officers” (within s24 of the DPP Act) of powers in relation to offences under the applied provisions of the Commonwealth Places Act, the State Act was “wholly repealed” by s24 of the DPP Act, the DPP Act being a latter Act. The Appellant submitted that since s24 of the DPP Act “covers the field” in respect of the State DPP’s powers relating to Commonwealth offences, it has “put an end to” the Arrangement. 
     56 There is no warrant for construing s24 as some kind of mini-code with respect to Commonwealth offences. It empowers a specific officer to institute and conduct prosecutions. It is a facultative provision. It is not necessary to decide whether the conduct of an appeal would, in any event, fall within the reference to “conduct prosecutions”. The mechanism for “taking over” an appeal provided in s9 and s10 can plainly operate without any inconsistency with s24. Sections 9 and 10 are applied as Commonwealth law under either s4(1) or s6(2) of the Commonwealth Places Act. Sections 4 and 5 of the State Act authorise the NSW DPP to perform these functions. 
     57 The Solicitor General submitted that the source of the DPP’s authority was the Commonwealth Places Act and the Arrangement. This authority covered the circumstances of this case, in which the DPP “took over” the matter pursuant to s9 of the DPP Act.  
     58 The Solicitor General submitted that s24 of the DPP Act does not operate as an implied repeal. The Solicitor General referred to Butler v Attorney General (Vic) (1961) 106 CLR 268 at 275-276 where Fullagar J said that for a latter statute to repeal an earlier one “actual contrariety” needed to be “clearly apparent”. He submitted that there was insufficient indication of any such intention in the DPP Act. 
     59 The State Act is part of a national collaborative scheme between the Commonwealth and all the States. The proposition that one State has impliedly repealed one of the provisions of this scheme without consultation, lacks even a scintilla of force. There is a strong presumption that a legislature in a federal system would not alter a statute that forms part of a collaborative and uniform national scheme, save in express terms. There is nothing express here. 
     60 In the course of oral submissions the Appellant propounded an alternative argument to the effect that on the proper construction of the Commonwealth Places Act, the Commonwealth DPP was given exclusive authority to conduct the proceedings of the character involved in this case. This submission turned on ss5(3) and (4) of the Commonwealth Places Act which provide: 
      
       
        
        “5(3) Where there is in force an arrangement with the Governor of a State under subsection (2) of the next succeeding section, the provisions of the Acts set out in the Schedule to this Act do not apply to or in relation to matters arising under the applied provisions having effect in or in relation to a Commonwealth place in that State. 
         
         
        (4) Paragraph 6(1)(e) of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983 applies, in relation to a State to which subsection (3) applies, only to proceedings instituted under the applied provisions by: 
         
         
          
          (a) the Director of Public Prosecutions; 
           
           
          (b) an officer of, or a person employed by, the Commonwealth or a body established by or under an Act or by or under a law of a Territory (other than the Northern Territory); or 
           
           
          (c) a person holding office under an Act or under a law of a Territory (other than the Northern Territory).” 
           
          
         
        
       
     61 The Schedule to the Act under s5(3) excludes ss6(1)(a), (b), (baa), (ba), and (f), ss9(1), (3), (3A), (4) and (5) and s11 of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983 (Cth) (“the Commonwealth DPP Act”). 
     62 The Appellant submitted that the pertinent provisions opf the Commonwealth DPP Act which continue to apply are sections 6(1)(c), (d) and (e) which state: 
      
       
        
        “6(1) The functions of the Director are: 
         
         
        … 
         
         
          
          (c) to institute proceedings for the commitment of persons for trial in respect of indictable offences against laws of the Commonwealth; and 
           
           
          (d) to institute proceedings for the summary conviction of persons in respect of offences against the laws of the Commonwealth; and 
           
           
          (e) to carry on proceedings of a kind referred to in paragraphs (c) or (d) (whether or not instituted by the Director)”. 
           
          
         
        
       
     63 In view of the submission that the powers of the Commonwealth DPP were exclusive, the Court gave the Commonwealth and opportunity to make submissions. The Attorney General of the Commonwealth intervened and filed a written submission. The Commonwealth submitted that the powers were not exclusive. 
     64 The words in parenthesis in s6(1)(e) indicate clearly that the Commonwealth Parliament was not intending to confer an exclusive power on the Commonwealth DPP. The power in s6(1)(e) to carry on proceedings expressly envisages, in terms, proceedings having been instituted by someone else (i.e. “whether or not instituted by the Director”).  
     65 Section 5(4), inserted by the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act (No 2) 1986 (Cth), of the Commonwealth Places Act reinforces the conclusion of non-exclusivity by expressly providing that the s6(1)(e) power may be exercised, in the case of a State with a s6(2) Arrangement, only if the original proceedings had been instituted by a Commonwealth officer. Section 5(4) operates to the same effect as if the Schedule to s5(3) included a reference to s6(1)(e) of the Commonwealth DPP Act with respect to proceedings instituted by officers of a State. 
     66 Accordingly, where, as here, a s6(2) Arrangement applies to proceedings, the Commonwealth DPP may not “carry on” the proceedings, because they were instituted by officers of the State. 
     67 The NSW DPP was authorised to perform the Commonwealth function by ss4 and 5 of the State Act. He had standing to respond to the appeal. 
     68 The Appellant’s submissions should be rejected. There was no error in her Honour’s determination 3(iii). 
      
       
       
       
       
      The Powers of State Police 
     69 The Appellant submitted that even if the relevant provisions of the Crimes Act applied to Commonwealth places, New South Wales police only had the power to arrest for State offences.  
     70 As quoted above, s4(1) of the Commonwealth Places Act applies the laws of the State “in accordance with their tenor” in Commonwealth places. The laws in issue were s352 and s357E of the Crimes Act which it is unnecessary to set out. They govern the power of New South Wales police to arrest and search in New South Wales for State offences. The Solicitor General contended that s4(1) “picked up” laws relating to such powers as well as substantive offences. The Solicitor General submitted that it was sufficient, however, to invoke s6 of the Act. Her Honour had found that to be so. I agree. 
     71 The Solicitor General submitted that members of the New South Wales police force are “authorities” for the purposes of s6 and the Arrangement. Accordingly, any “powers, duty or function” of the police may be “exercised or performed” under the applied substantive provisions. 
     72 To reinforce his submission, the Solicitor General referred to s5(3) of the Act which states that if there exists an arrangement under s6(2) “the provisions of the Acts set out in the Schedule … do not apply to or in relation to matters arising under the applied provisions having effect in or in relation to a Commonwealth place”. The Schedule includes “Part 1AA (other than section 3Z)” of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), which Part governs search and arrest. It was submitted that the exclusion of these provisions is “a clear indication” that State powers of search and arrest were intended to apply to matters arising under the applied provisions.  
     73 The Solicitor General’s submissions should be upheld. A police officer is an “officer or employee of the State” within par (e) of the definition of “authority” in s3, as quoted above. 
     74 On the basis that the offence is a Commonwealth offence, in my opinion s6(2) contemplates, and the Arrangement implements, a co-operative regime in which State authorities may exercise powers, inter alia of arrest and search, conferred by a State Act, and may do so with respect to Commonwealth offences. 
     75 The powers of arrest and search in s352 and s357E of the Crimes Act are a “power or … function” within both s6(2) of the Commonwealth Places Act and the Agreement. By force of that section and the Agreement, the arrest and search was carried out by State police officers “under the applied provisions”. They were authorised to act as they did in a Commonwealth place by Commonwealth law. 
     76 The long title of the Act extends to both the “Application” and the “Administration” of laws. Section 4 applies laws of a State to Commonwealth places which encompass a range of Commonwealth enclaves of differing size and significance. The purpose of the collaborative Commonwealth and State Acts was to fill the lacuna that the High Court had revealed to exist both in the application and the administration of State laws, long thought to have applied seamlessly throughout the territorial area of a State including, as each State had long done, numerous Commonwealth enclaves. 
     77 The purpose of this legislation is overwhelmingly better served by ensuring that the administration of State laws, including criminal investigation laws, operate as seamlessly as they had long done. That was a purpose of the wholesale application of all such laws, which the Commonwealth Parliament enacted in s4. There is no warrant for reading down the reference to “power … or function” in s6(2). 
     78 The Appellant relied on an observation by Dennis Rose in his article “The Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act 1970” (1971) 4 FLR 263 where the learned author said: 
      
       
        
        “Moreover, s4(14) confirms that State authorities may exercise any State powers outside Commonwealth places in relation to conduct inside Commonwealth places. However, in view of the decision in Phillips this will not apply to powers of arrest for criminal offences concerning conduct in Commonwealth places.”  
        (at 276) 
        
       
     79 In this passage there is reference only to s4(14). Mr Rose did not mention s6(2) and the Arrangement pursuant to that subsection. Phillips may well stand for the proposition that a State may not authorise an arrest in a place to which s52(i) of the Constitution applies. However, a Commonwealth Act may, in my opinion, authorise a State officer to effect an arrest or conduct a search at such a place and to do so in accordance with a State legislative scheme.  
     80 The Appellant’s contention in this regard should be rejected. There was no error in her Honour’s determination 3(ii). 
      
       
      Section 109 Inconsistency 
     81 The Appellant contended that there was an inconsistency, within the meaning of s109 of the Constitution, between s527C of the Crimes Act and s82 of the Proceeds of Crimes Act 1987 (Cth). 
     82 Section 82 states, relevantly: 
      
       
        
        “82(1) A person who, after the commencement of this Act, receives, possesses, conceals, disposes of or brings into Australia any money, or other property, that may reasonably be suspected of being proceeds of crime is guilty of an offence against this section punishable, upon conviction, by: 
         
         
          
          (a) if the offender is a natural person – a fine not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 2 years, or both … ” 
          
         
        
       
     83 Section 527C of the Crimes Act states, relevantly: 
      
       
        
        “527C(1) Any person who: 
         
         
          
          (a) has any thing in his or her custody; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) has any thing in the custody of another person; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) has any thing in or on premises, whether belonging to or occupied by himself or herself or not, or whether that thing is there for his or her own use or the use of another; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) gives custody of any thing to a person who is not lawfully entitled to possession of the thing, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        which thing may be reasonably suspected of being stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained, shall be liable on conviction before a Local Court constituted by a Magistrate sitting alone to imprisonment for 6 months, or to a fine of 5 penalty units.” 
        
       
     84 The Appellant submitted that s82 of the Proceeds of Crime Act “covers the field” of possession of proceeds of crime from the commission of a Commonwealth indictable offence. 
     85 This submission was entirely misconceived. As noted above, by force of s4(1) of the Commonwealth Places Act, s527C of the Crimes Act relevantly operates as a Commonwealth law. In the circumstances, there is no “law of a State” within s109. 
     86 Her Honour did not err in determination 3(iv). 
      
       
      Conclusion 
     87 Paragraph [5] of the Stated Case should be answered “No determination was erroneous in law”. 
      
       
       
       
     88 STUDDERT J: I agree with the Chief Justice. 
     89 IRELAND AJ: I agree with the Chief Justice for the reasons given by his Honour.

      HIS HONOUR  
      :  
       
       
      The properties 
      
    1 The plaintiffs are the owners of a property known as ""Alandale"", 148 Yarramundi Lane, Agnes Banks. They purchased it from Mr and Mrs Wilson in 1988. The property was used principally as a citrus orchard, with some pecan trees, until 1998. The plaintiffs now carry on business principally as market gardeners there. Most of the citrus trees and the pecan trees were removed in 1998, in circumstances that I shall describe.  
     
      
    2 The defendants are the owners of the adjoining land, 128 (sometimes called 123) Yarramundi Lane. They acquired their property in 1986, and shortly afterwards they cleared the land of citrus trees and established a market garden. Subsequently they reached an agreement with their neighbour on the opposite side to the plaintiffs' land with respect to drainage, and they constructed drainage channels on their land and their neighbour's, causing rainwater to flow towards Yarramundi Lane just below their common boundary. 
     
      
    3 The plaintiffs’ and defendants’ properties are approximately rectangular, although the rear boundaries, near the river frontage, are irregular. Yarramundi Lane runs along the south-eastern boundary of each of the two properties, and the Hawkesbury River is roughly parallel to the Lane, at the back of the two properties. No 148, the plaintiffs' property, is to the southwest of No 128, the defendants' property. The land slopes generally from the south-west to the north-east. Care must be taking into evaluating the evidence of some of the witnesses, and the evidence observed during the view on 23 April 2001, because imprecise compass directions have been used from time to time.  
     
      
    4 There is an unsealed driveway running parallel to the boundary between the plaintiffs' and the defendants' land, on the defendants' side, from Yarramundi Lane to the defendants' house. It is about 200 metres long. 
     
      
    5 The parties agree that the plaintiffs' land is generally higher than the defendants' land. During storms, surface water passes in a north-easterly direction through the plaintiffs' and defendants' properties, along a natural drainage depression. Some run-off is collected in a collection pond on the plaintiffs' land, which the plaintiffs constructed after they converted the main use of the land to a market garden.  
     
      
    6 Mr McKinlay, a registered surveyor engaged by the plaintiffs, undertook a survey of levels and details at the two properties in July 2000 and prepared a plan, showing an area of inundation on the plaintiffs' property. It is an area of approximately 4,200 sq m, of roughly triangular shape, widest at the boundary, jutting into the plaintiffs' land roughly one-quarter of the way along the boundary from Yarramundi Lane.  
     
      
       
      The proceedings  
      
    7 It is evident that Mr Micallef and Mr Galea dislike one another intensely. They are both strong-minded, even stubborn men. Mrs Micallef strongly supports her husband's stance. No evidence was given by Mrs Galea, but there is nothing to indicate that she would wish or be able to take the role of peacemaker. In these circumstances, since they are neighbours, conflict between the Micallefs and the Galeas was probably inevitable.  
     
      
    8 In October 1999, the defendants deposited four to six truckloads of roadbase on their driveway, which runs along part of the boundary between the defendants' land and the plaintiffs' land. The plaintiffs commenced the present proceedings, contending that the deposit of the roadbase had the effect of raising the level of the defendants' land and altering the natural water flow between the two properties. Consequently, they say, stormwater, which had previously drained from the plaintiffs' land onto the defendants’ land, instead forms ponds on the plaintiffs' land and inundates it in times of wet weather. 
     
      
    9 The plaintiffs assert that by depositing the roadbase on the driveway, the defendants committed an actionable nuisance, or a breach of their duty to exercise reasonable care to ensure that any works that they might carry out on their land would not cause damage to the plaintiffs' land. They were negligent, according to the plaintiffs, in failing to construct a pipe under the driveway, or a depression in the driveway, to enable water to flow from the plaintiffs' land onto the defendants' land, and in failing to take any other steps to make provision for the water to continue to flow from the plaintiffs' land onto the defendants' land, and in ignoring demands by the plaintiffs to remove the roadbase and to restore the level of the driveway to its natural level. 
     
      
    10 The plaintiffs claim a mandatory injunction to require the defendants to carry out such works as may be necessary, or those the Court may specify, in order that the driveway and defendants' land ceases to constitute a nuisance, an injunction to restrain the defendants from placing any more roadbase or other material on their driveway, and damages (principally for damage to their crops). I should note immediately that the evidence of damage was very sketchy, and the case proceeded on the basis that it would be necessary to conduct an inquiry as to damages if the plaintiffs were successful in establishing liability. I should also note that the cost of carrying out work to remedy the problem, if a mandatory injunction were granted, would probably be less than $1000, for all that would be needed would be the lowering of section of the driveway some 15 m wide, by either 80 mm (according to the defendants' expert) or 200 mm (according to the plaintiffs' expert).  
     
      
    11 The defendants claim that, during the period 1996 to 1999, the plaintiffs made extensive changes to the uses of their land. They undertook major excavation work, including work to level and change the contours of their land and to establish open drains. The defendants say that in 1998/1999 the plaintiffs levelled and filled a hollow of about 2-3 acres in their land, the hollow previously having been below the level of the defendants' land. Further, the defendants say that in 1998 the plaintiffs demolished an embankment which ran along the boundary between the plaintiffs' and the defendants' land.  
     
      
    12 According to the defendants, the effect of these various activities has been to alter the way in which the water flowed and drained from the plaintiffs’ land. The defendants admit to having place roadbase on their driveway, raising the level of their land accordingly. They say that the effect of placing roadbase along the driveway was to restore the level of the driveway to the level of the embankment which had previously run along the boundary, in effect restoring the embankment that had been removed by the plaintiffs in 1999. They say that the water flow from the plaintiffs' to the defendants' land is not a natural watercourse because the water flows through the drains constructed by the plaintiffs. They say that water, which naturally flowed into the hollow on the plaintiffs’ land, cannot now do so because the plaintiffs have filled it in. In the circumstances, they contend that the placement of the roadbase on their driveway was a reasonable step taken by them to protect their enjoyment of their own land. 
     
      
       
      The law  
      
    13 The issues between the parties are issues of fact. There is no significant dispute as to the applicable principles of law. So far as the law of nuisance is concerned, the relevant principles were summarised by Windeyer J (with whom Dixon CJ agreed) in Gartner v Kidman (1962) 108 CLR 12, at 47-49 (see also Furness v Clark (1971) 1 SASR 359). I am content to proceed on the principle which counsel for the plaintiffs formulated as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""If the plaintiff proves that he has suffered damage by increased flooding of his land brought about by an action of the defendant, he is entitled to succeed in an action for nuisance unless the defendant proves that his action amounted to a natural or a reasonable use of his own land or a reasonable measure of protection of it."" 
        
       
      
    14 The plaintiffs do not, as I understand their case, assert rights in the nature of riparian rights, and the evidence does not suggest that the flow of water from the plaintiffs' to the defendants' land was a ""watercourse"" or ""natural watercourse"" (cf Gartner's case at 26-27 per Windeyer J). This case is about stormwater run-off collected in drainage depressions, rather than water flowing through a channel consisting of a bed, banks and a stream. Clearly stormwater run-off is a serious problem for market gardeners, and a particularly difficult one for the plaintiffs and the defendants because of the natural drainage depression affecting their respective properties.  
     
      
    15 In Gartner's case Windeyer J made it clear (at 47-49) that where landholders are the owners of contiguous properties, one of which is on a higher level than the other, the lower landholder is not subject to any ""natural servitude"" to receive surplus water from the higher landholder without obstruction. The question is whether the lower landholder has engaged in some conduct which has caused damage (typically by flooding) to the higher landholder, which was not a natural or reasonable use of the lower landholder's land or a reasonable measure of protection of it: see also Knezovic v Shire of Swan Gilford (1968) 118 CLR 495; and generally, Derham, D, ""Interference with Surface Waters by Lower Landholders,"" (1958) 74 LQR 361.  
     
      
    16 It is unnecessary, for the purpose of deciding the present case, to analyse the facts and decisions of reported cases. Although counsel bravely made some submissions based upon the facts of such cases as Elston v Dore (1982) 149 CLR 480 and Sedleigh-Denfield v O'Callaghan [1940] AC 880, and also Comserv (No 1877) Pty Ltd v Wollongong City Council [2001] NSWSC 302, I find the factual determinations in those cases of no direct assistance to me here. The principal question for me is whether the defendants' action was reasonable in the circumstances of the present case, in the sense explained by the authorities.  
     
      
    17 The defendants claim that it was reasonable for them to build up the roadbase on their driveway to stem the excessive flow of stormwater onto their land, so as to minimise the adverse impact of the water on their crops. In Elston v Dore the majority of the High Court (at 488) adopted, as ""the proper test to apply in most cases"", the following statement by Lord Wright in Sedleigh-Denfield v O'Callaghan (at 903): 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is impossible to give any precise and universal formula, but it may broadly be said that a useful test is perhaps what is reasonable according to the ordinary uses of mankind living in society, or more correctly in a particular society."" 
        
       
       
      Their Honours continued: 
       
        
        ""although the wide and uncertain boundaries of the law of nuisance include cases in which negligence in the narrow sense is not essential, fault of some kind is almost always necessary. In the present case the action of the respondent was deliberate, but in our opinion it will only have been wrongful if it was not reasonable in the sense to which Lord Wright refers."" 
        
       
       
      Agreement as to factual issues 
      
    18 The parties have reached a limited agreement as to the factual issues that need to be determined. In their agreed statement of issues, they formulated the following questions:19 Have the acts of the plaintiffs had the effect of concentrating the flow of surface water from the plaintiffs' land onto the defendants' land?· Did the deposit of road fill alter the level of the plaintiffs' land so as to stop the surface water coming onto the defendants' land with the consequence that the plaintiffs' land has suffered increased flooding?· Did the alleged embankment or driveway alter the natural flow of surface water so as to stop surface water coming from the plaintiffs' land onto the defendants' land with the consequence that the plaintiffs' land suffered increased flooding?· Was the action of the defendants in either maintaining the embankment or alternatively placing the road fill a natural or reasonable use of the defendants' land or reasonable measure of protection so as to absolve them from responsibility for any damage caused to the plaintiffs? 
     
      
    20 I accept that these questions must be answered, but I have not found the presentation of them to be helpful, in terms of systematically determining the factual issues. It will be clearer, I think, if I proceed historically, by· considering the state of the two properties prior to 1997, and the nature of the water flow up to that year; · identifying the work done by the plaintiffs to their property in 1997-99 and its effect on water flow;· deciding whether the plaintiffs demolished an existing “embankment”, or part of it, in 1998; and· ascertaining the effect of the laying of roadbase by the defendants on the water flow. 
     
      
    21 I shall then return to the agreed statement of issues for determination, and set out my answers to the questions raised by the parties, and reach my conclusions accordingly. 
     
      
    22 It is appropriate to note, before commencing the factual analysis, that a feature of this case has been the conflicting evidence of experts. There is no dispute about the evidence of Mr McKinlay, a surveyor engaged by the plaintiffs. But the defendants and their expert hydrologist, Dr Webb, challenge the geotechnical and hydrological evidence given on behalf of the plaintiffs by Mr Blinman and Mr Downes respectively. Having considered their reports and having observed them both in the witness box, I find myself generally favouring the evidence of Dr Webb over the evidence of Mr Downes. Dr Webb’s evidence was clear and logical, and covered all relevant issues. I thought that Mr Downes did not deal adequately with the defendants’ contention that additional water flow was caused by the plaintiffs’ actions in 1997-99. I shall deal with their evidence in more detail later. 
     
      
    23 There was a meeting between Dr Webb and Mr Downes on 8 November 2000, leading to a statement of issues, matters agreed upon and matters not agreed upon. I shall refer to the statement, where appropriate, as the ""Experts' Statement of Issues"". 
     
      
       
      The state of the properties before 1997 
      
    24 In his first affidavit, made on 1 June 2000, Mr Galea said there was an embankment about two feet high and about three feet wide running the entire length of the boundary between the two properties. His son Charlie, in his affidavit dated 20 June 2000, described a ""levy bank"" running from Yarramundi Lane all the way to the old farmhouse on the property, the height of which varied from approximately one metre to approximately half a metre.  
     
      
    25 Both of them said, in those affidavits, that there was a waterhole in a depression in the plaintiffs' land, estimated by Mr Galea to be about two to three acres in size, and by Charlie to be about three to four acres in size. Mr Galea did not regard the waterhole as permanent, but only as a pond holding excess water during times of heavy rain, which would eventually drain away. Charlie said the waterhole was to a depth of one to one and a half metres and, I infer, he regarded it as a permanent feature of the plaintiffs' land.  
     
      
    26 Mr Galea said that at times of light to moderate rainfall, rainwater would usually drain very quickly into the ground, but if rainfall was heavier than usual, water on the plaintiffs' land would be contained by the embankment and would run into the pond. According to his evidence, it was only during periods of very heavy rainfall exceeding about four inches (on average two or three times per year), that water gathering on the plaintiffs' land would breach the embankment and run onto the defendants' land. 
     
      
    27 In his affidavit of 22 April 2001, and his oral evidence, Mr Galea qualified his earlier evidence by saying that what he had described as an embankment two feet high and three feet wide may have been in various places less than that, and that by using the word ""embankment"" in his earlier affidavit he meant to describe a raised mound of earth. I found Mr Galea's oral evidence on this point quite unconvincing, but nevertheless the picture emerges from his evidence as a whole that there was a mound of earth of variable width along the boundary, quite low at one point and higher at other points. In my opinion the word ""embankment"" suggests a more substantial structure, and it would be better not to use the word here. 
     
      
    28 In his affidavit of 18 July 2000, Mr Micallef said that for about one-third of the distance along the common boundary, there was no embankment but the plaintiffs' property was about six inches higher than the defendants'. He said that about one-third of the way along the boundary from the Lane, the common boundary was flat for a distance of approximately 10 metres. As to the presence of a waterhole or pond, Mr Micallef said that water would pond on his land only for a few hours after heavy rain. Mrs Micallef said, in her affidavit of 17 April 2001, that there was no embankment at all along the boundary, and that she had never observed any ponding of water on the plaintiffs' property until the defendants raised the level of the driveway. Mr Camilleri, Mrs Micallef's brother, who worked as a market gardener in the area between 1988 in 1998, gave evidence that there was never an embankment on or near the boundary except for a raised area near the defendants' house, and he said that water would run off the plaintiffs' property within a day. 
     
      
    29 In my opinion, the photographic evidence annexed to Mr Galea's affidavit of 22 April 2001, which I accept as having been taken before the plaintiffs converted their property into a market garden, shows that there was a mound of earth running along the boundary, parallel to the driveway. It was at its lowest, but still visible, at the point where the water streamed across from the plaintiffs' land to flood the driveway, in photographs FG 1 and 2. The mound was a little higher back towards the Lane, and considerably higher further along the Lane towards the house.  
     
      
    30 I have reached this conclusion by observation of the photographs, with the assistance of the written and oral evidence as a whole, and in particular the evidence of Dr Webb in his report of 8 November 2000, which he bases upon his analysis of survey evidence.  
     
      
    31 This conclusion implies that I accept Mr Galea's revised evidence on the question of the ""embankment"", while rejecting his earlier evidence and the evidence of his son, and also rejecting the evidence of Mr and Mrs Micallef and Mr Camilleri. 
     
      
    32 As to the question whether there was a pond or waterhole in the drainage depression, I am not prepared to accept the evidence of Mrs Micallef and Mr Camilleri, which seems to me too categorical to be plausible, especially given the photographic evidence of the amount of water on the defendants' land in the 1989 flood. Mr Micallef's evidence was more plausible but I found him to be an unreliable witness, because he disclosed some relevant and important evidence only in the course of cross-examination. I refer to the facts that the plaintiffs constructed a collection pond on their land, and that Mr Micallef obtained a licence to draw water from the Hawkesbury River for irrigation on 18 May 1999, subject to various conditions including the condition that the licensee must not allow tailwater drainage to discharge onto any other person’s land. Neither of these matters was mentioned by Mr Micallef in any of his affidavits.  
     
      
    33 The expert evidence to which I shall refer (including the 1982 photograph and the interpretation of it by all experts) leads me to conclude that there was a drainage depression on the plaintiffs' land, further away from the Lane than the collection pond which Mr Micallef later constructed, and that water flowed into that drainage depression at times of heavy rain, in all probability ponding there. Ponding also occurred, at times of heavy rain, adjacent to the low mound of earth that can be observed in photographs FG 1 and 2, since ponding can be observed in those photographs. 
     
      
    34 Neither Mr and Mrs Micallef, nor Mr Galea and his son, were able to give evidence as to the state of the properties before 1986. However, evidence on that subject was given by Mr Daryl Schofield. Mr Schofield has been, since 1968, part owner with his brother of the property adjacent to the plaintiffs' property, to the south-west - that is, on the opposite side to the defendants' land. From 1949 to about 1985 he also farmed property owned by his father, north-east of the plaintiffs' and defendants' land, several blocks away. In 1951 his father purchased a second block, and Mr Schofield lived there with his parents until he married in 1964. He said he regularly walked and rode a pushbike across the defendants' land during the period from 1950 to the early 1960s, when visiting a girlfriend who lived on the defendants land, and also a friend who lived on land further upstream. Since 1962, he said, he has travelled along Yarramundi Lane at least four times a week (though it emerged in cross-examination that he has not been on the defendants' driveway since 1986). He said that, therefore, he is familiar with conditions affecting properties along Yarramundi Lane as a result of rainfall, and has been for a long time.  
     
      
    35 He claimed that as long as he has owned his property, he has observed that during periods of heavy or frequent rainfall, water flows from a property situated two properties away from his property on the south-western side, through the property next-door to his, owned by Mr Gardiner, then sequentially through his property to the properties owned by the plaintiffs and the defendants, and Mr and Mrs Bugeja, who own the property adjacent to the defendants' to the north-east. He said that when the water reaches Mr and Mrs Bugeja's land, it changes course and flows onto Yarramundi Lane.  
     
      
    36 Mr Schofield said that he has never observed any embankment running along the boundary line between the plaintiffs' and the defendants' land immediately adjacent to the defendants' dirt driveway. He has observed a mound of dirt further along the driveway, between defendants' house and a shed, nowhere near the area where the present pooling of water occurs.  
     
      
    37 Mr Schofield also said that he has never seen ponding on the plaintiffs' land, prior to October 1999. He denied the defendants' claim that there was a large pond, two or three acres in size, near the eastern corner of the plaintiffs' land. He said that the area in question was occupied by citrus trees when the property was owned by the Wilsons, and if there had been continuous ponding the trees would not have been able to survive. 
     
      
    38 I have decided not to accept Mr Schofield's evidence, where it is contradicted by the evidence of Mr Galea. I formed the impression from observing him in the witness box that Mr Schofield is a supporter of the plaintiffs against the defendants, determined to give an account favourable to the plaintiffs. Earlier this year he sold them the property he owned with his brother, adjacent to the plaintiffs' property to the north-east. He is in the plaintiffs' camp.  
     
      
    39 Mr Schofield was cross-examined about some photographs taken by Mr Galea of the defendants' driveway and property. Evidently they were taken during heavy rain and flooding in 1989. Photograph FG 3 shows the defendants' property taken from the driveway, the photographer's back being turned to the plaintiffs' property. It clearly shows relatively deep ponding in the foreground, near the driveway, ponding interrupted by clods of earth in the middle distance, suggesting that the water was less deep, and in the distance, earth and greenery before the tree-line. Mr Schofield claimed that the flooding was caused by a back-up of water from Pugh’s lagoon, a lagoon located beyond Yarramundi Lane, some distance from the tree line at the rear of the picture. That evidence is inconsistent with the observable facts, namely that the water is deepest in the foreground, shallower in the middle ground, and in the distance, between the flooding and Pugh’s lagoon, there is greenery. It is also inconsistent with Mr Schofield's admission, later in cross-examination, that water flowed from the high properties across the plaintiffs' land and onto the defendants' land. 
     
      
    40 Mr Schofield initially said in evidence that there was no strip of green between the tree line and the flooded area in FG 3, although he acknowledged a strip of green at the top right corner of the photograph along Yarramundi Lane, which he suggested might be corn. Then he changed his evidence to say that there was a strip of green in front of the trees and to suggest it was the top of a corn crop. The overall impression was unconvincing. 
     
      
    41 Photographs FG 1 and 2 show water ponding on the plaintiffs' side of the driveway, overflowing over a low mound of earth in the middle distance, but not overflowing further along the driveway where the mound of earth parallel to the driveway is higher. Mr Schofield's evidence was that in the middle distance there was no mound of earth at all, only tufts of grass protruding through the water. In my opinion that is contradicted by what is observable from the photographs.  
     
      
    42 Mr Schofield also denied that the fixed watering system now used by the plaintiffs for their market garden uses more water than the travelling irrigator that had been used when the property was largely a citrus orchard. That is inherently implausible, in light of the other evidence in case. He said he did not know whether the plaintiffs had constructed any form of catchment to collect irrigation or tailwater after they converted the property from an orchard to a market garden (a fact admitted by Mr Micallef in cross-examination), and yet he claimed that he was able to observe other matters of considerable detail over the years.  
     
      
    43 Mr Schofield admitted that along the boundary lines between rural properties it is common for earth and grass and vegetation to build up and form a mound, but he claimed that he had never observed anything of that kind along the boundary line between the plaintiffs' and the defendants' properties. That evidence is contrary to what I observed during the Court's view of the property, which took place on 23 April 2001, when a mound was visible along part of the boundary line, but there was no mound along the part of the boundary line adjacent to the area where the defendants had built up their driveway by adding roadbase. 
     
      
    44 The defendants' expert, Dr Webb, attached to his report of June 2000 a series of historical aerial photographs. One of them shows the land in 1982. Dr Webb said that it was clear from this photograph that there has been a drainage depression running through the plaintiffs' and defendants' properties and further downstream since at least 1982. He said it was evident from the photograph that the low point was located further toward the river than the present low point. He drew attention to an area of sparsely distributed orchard trees, which he identified as the drainage depression. Mr Downes, the plaintiffs' expert, responded in his report of August 2000. He overlaid the contours from the 1982 aerial photograph on the most recent aerial photograph, and concluded that the present earth drain through the plaintiffs' property and the overflow path from the collection pond to the defendants' property were located approximately in the same position as the original drainage depression, and that the collection pond was approximately 16 m from the original drainage depression, towards the Lane. Dr Webb did not challenge these conclusions in his response of November 2000. I infer that the earthworks carried out by the plaintiffs in 1997-98 did not substantially re-locate the drainage depression, but rather they ""formalised"" it to the extent of constructing an open drain there.  
     
      
    45 In my opinion the true condition of the properties during the period from 1988 to 1996 is shown in photographs FG 1, 2 and 3. Citrus trees on the plaintiffs' land grew up to a few metres from the boundary. There was a mound of earth and vegetation approximately along the boundary line parallel to the defendants' driveway. In 1989 the mound was quite low at the point shown in the photographs, but the mound was still there, sufficient to retain water on the plaintiffs' land except at times of heavy rain. In the flood of 1989, water ponded on the plaintiffs' land under the citrus trees and between them and the mound at the boundary, where shown in the photographs, but there was so much flooding that the water flowed over the mound, across the defendants' driveway and onto the defendants' land, flooding it extensively. 
     
      
       
      The work done by the plaintiffs in 1997-99 
      
    46 In 1997 the plaintiffs removed 35 acres of orange trees and 14 pecan trees from their property. They then used a tractor-like machine called a ""scraper"", to level the land and prepare it for growing vegetables. At the same time, they constructed open drains, to facilitate the growing vegetables. Mr Galea's evidence was that the plaintiffs undertook ""major excavation work"", and in particular that they deposited sand and soil in the depression in their land that had previously formed the waterhole or pond at times of high rainfall. In his affidavit evidence Mr Micallef denied this, and said that the machine simply cleared up the mess left by the removal of the trees. 
     
      
    47 It seems to me plain, even from the plaintiffs' written and oral evidence, that the earthworks undertaken after removal of the citrus trees were quite extensive. The levelling out the land after removal of mature trees would itself be a significant undertaking, requiring the moving of earth to fill the holes left by the trees. The construction of a new system of open drains would also be a substantial undertaking. The scale of the work was observable during the Court's view of the property on 23 April 2001. The photographs annexed to Mr Galea's affidavit of 1 June 2000 show the land totally flattened, something that would be achieved, after removal of trees, only by substantial earthworks. Mr Micallef's affidavit of 17 April 2001 also annexes some photographs, including one that shows his land, ploughed in furrows for growing market vegetables.  
     
      
    48 It seems to me a reasonable inference that in the course of those earthworks, any natural depression in the land would have been removed, and replaced by the ""artificial"" depression constituted by the open drain. But there is evidence on this subject, which should be considered before inferences are drawn. Mr Blinman, the plaintiffs' geotechnical expert, conducted some tests on the plaintiffs' land, after discussions with Mr Galea relating to the area of the plaintiffs' land which he claimed to have been filled. Mr Blinman dug six test pits within the area defined by Mr Galea. After analysing earth from the test pits, he concluded that the soils present across the plaintiffs' property were consistent and there was no evidence of filling in the area of the original drainage depression. 
     
      
    49 As Dr Webb pointed out in his report of November 2000, Mr Blinman's conclusion is consistent with Mr Galea's evidence that the drainage depression was filled by earth moved by the scraper from other parts of the plaintiffs' property. Mr Galea did not suggest that filling material was moved in from another place. It is therefore not surprising that sub-surface investigations did not reveal any significant differences in soil characteristics. 
     
      
    50 In my opinion, the evidence as a whole establishes that the drainage depression that had existed on the plaintiffs' land while it was an orchard was removed by the earthworks, and replaced by ""artificial"" drainage in the form of the open drain constructed at approximately the same place. 
     
      
    51 I turn next to the question whether the earthworks, and conversion of the plaintiffs' property from a citrus orchard to a market garden, increased the water flow from the plaintiffs' to the defendants' land. This is a controversial issue, between the parties and their respective experts.  
     
      
    52 Mr Blinman recognised the possibility that the change in land use may have contributed to the increased surface water at the site, but he dismissed this possibility on the ground that a similar problem would have been encountered on the other side of the defendants' property, but in his view no such problem had arisen. Apparently Mr Blinman was not informed that the drainage problem on the other side of the defendants' property was addressed by agreement between the neighbours, leading to the construction of drains to cause the water to run off towards Yarramundi Lane. Mr Blinman also said that Dr Webb had overstated the effect of the change in land use on increased run-off, though it seems to me that Mr Blinman's calculation still pointed towards a substantial increase. Mr Blinman appears to have been dismissive of the theory that change in land use had led to an increase in run-off because of his belief that no evidence had been given that extensive earthworks had taken place, nor that there was an increase in irrigation. Evidence on these matters is now before the court, and therefore the foundation of Mr Blinman's reasoning has been partly undermined. 
     
      
    53 In my opinion, the earthworks and the plaintiffs' new use of the land did increase the water flow at times of heavy rain. The plaintiffs urged me to give weight to the fact that the defendants did not complain about excess stormwater passing onto their land after the plaintiffs completed the earthworks and changed the use of their property, but before the laying of the roadbase. I do not believe it would be appropriate to place emphasis on that fact. As I have said, the relationship between the parties was already bad. Mr Galea is not highly literate and from my observation of him, he would not readily instruct solicitors to lodge a complaint of this kind.  
     
      
    54 Dr Webb and Mr Downes agreed that there was likely to be some increase in the volume of stormwater run-off from the plaintiffs' property as a result of changes to the land use, but whereas Mr Downes considered that the changes would not be significant, Dr Webb considered that they would be the primary cause of the drainage problem apparent at the property boundary. The issue is not easy one, but I have decided that I agree with Dr Webb's conclusion. Three factors lead me to this view.  
     
      
    55 First, the new drainage system facilitated the water flow down towards the defendants' property. In this respect I accept the evidence of Dr Webb, having observed him in the witness box and having listened to his answers in cross-examination. He described a ""careful grading of the roads/drains to the low point near the defendants' boundary"", which in his view resulted in water being collected and concentrated and hence conveyed downstream faster, with less chance to soak into the ground. He said that the concentration of the flow into these carefully graded paths had reduced the natural ponding in the small irregular depressions over the whole property that would have existed before.  
     
      
    56 Dr Webb's analysis was rejected by Mr Downes. Mr Downes pointed out that furrows had replaced the natural ponding that may have existed in the orchard, and since the furrows were perpendicular to the flow direction they would intercept and store surface run-off before allowing it to flow into the collection drains. He conceded that the drains might concentrate sheet flows and speed the flow of run-off, but he said that since the drains had flat gradients, flow velocities were slow. 
     
      
    57 In his response of November 2000, Dr Webb said that the furrows were themselves flow paths in many locations, directing water to the main drains. That statement corresponds with my observations during the Court's view. Dr Webb's conclusion on this point is plausible and I accept it. 
     
      
    58 Secondly, having converted to use of their property to a market garden, the plaintiffs installed a fixed watering system that watered the vegetables and, necessarily, the furrows between them, and used water more extensively than the travelling irrigator that was used while the property was a citrus orchard. Since the plaintiffs' property is now more extensively watered, there is less scope for absorption of excess rainwater.  
     
      
    59 Again, there was conflicting expert evidence on these matters. Dr Webb regarded it as a significant factor, drawing attention to the extent of the irrigation infrastructure on the plaintiffs' land, and asserting that a wetting of the soil horizon by 10 mm before heavy rain would increase run-off volumes by 30 percent.  
     
      
    60 Mr Downes said that to apply 10 mm of irrigation water to the plaintiffs' property would require the plaintiffs' irrigation pump to operate continuously for 8.8 hours, and therefore the assumption made by Dr Webb was unrealistic.  
     
      
    61 In response, using irrigation schedules supplied by the plaintiffs, and Dr Webb calculated that an average depth of 24 mm of rainfall was applied across the plaintiffs' property once a week in winter, and three times a week in summer, by irrigation. He concluded that the moisture content of the upper soil layer would typically be saturated and the potential for direct run-off during rainwater events would be high. He said that the excess irrigation water would gradually drain through the soil profile leading to a build-up of water in the lower depression area of the property, as could be observed on site. I accept this evidence. 
     
      
    62 Thirdly, the change of use the property from orchard trees to a market garden would affect the absorption of surface water. As Dr Webb observed, the orchard trees would have removed a lot of moisture by evapotranspiration. That evidence was not plausibly contradicted by expert evidence on behalf of the plaintiffs. 
     
      
    63 Finally I should mention two other things that happened before the defendants added roadbase to the driveway in October 1999. One was that the plaintiffs constructed a collection pond in the lower corner of their property near the boundary with the defendants' property, behind the remaining citrus trees that abutted the Yarramundi Lane boundary. As I have mentioned, it is a matter is some concern to me that the collection pond was not mentioned in the plaintiffs' affidavits, but only in cross-examination. Counsel for the defendants also criticised Mr Downes, for not mentioning the collection pond in his original affidavit. However, he dealt with it adequately in his longer report, and I therefore reject that criticism of him. The significance of the collection pond is that it tends to confirm that the plaintiffs found it necessary to deal with excess water on their land, before the defendants elevated the driveway. 
     
      
    64 Secondly, on 18 May 1999 Mr Micallef was informed that his application for a licence to draw water from the Hawkesbury River for irrigation had been successful. He said in cross-examination that he had used this licence to irrigate the plaintiffs' market garden. One of the conditions of the licence was that the licensee must not allow any tailwater drainage to discharge into any other person's land. It is hard to see how that licence condition would be satisfied if water were allowed to flow freely onto the defendants' land during rain, since there would at least be a risk that both stormwater and tailwater would flow across the boundary. On this point I prefer the evidence of Dr Webb to the evidence of Mr Downes, whose assertion that the collection pond would cope with all excess irrigation water did not properly take into account the effect of heavy rain. 
     
      
    65 The relevance of this is to reinforce my conclusion that the plaintiffs' altered use of their land has changed the circumstances under which water flowed across the boundary at previous times. That the elevation of the driveway prevented tailwater from river irrigation from flowing onto the defendants' land, in breach of a condition of Mr Micallef's licence, is relevant to the reasonableness of the defendants' conduct in altering the elevation of the driveway. 
     
      
       
      Did the plaintiffs demolish an existing embankment in 1998? 
      
    66 In his affidavit of 1 June 2000 Mr Galea said that, one or two months after completion of the earthworks, he saw Mr Micallef in a tractor, to which a grader blade was attached, levelling the ""embankment"" on the boundary by pushing the raised earth back across the plaintiffs' land. Mr Micallef, in his affidavit of 18 July 2000, denied having demolished or levelled any embankment, while admitting that when he was using a tractor with a grader blade to prepare his land to plant crops, the tractor encroached onto the defendants' property by a few inches during a turn. 
     
      
    67 It was apparent from inspection of the property on 23 April 2001 that there was, at that time, no mound along the boundary adjacent to the area where the defendants had laid roadbase to raise the level of the driveway. The photographs taken during the 1989 flood show a low mound, substantial enough to affect water flow, along the boundary in that area. Something must have happened to remove that low mound. In response to Mr Galea's allegation that Mr Micallef flattened the low mound by using a tractor with a grader blade, Mr Micallef admitted that the tractor with a grader blade encroached onto the defendants' property, evidently in the same area. It seems to me a reasonable inference, taking the evidence (including my observations of the witnesses in the witness box) a whole, that Mr Micallef did in fact flatten the low mound of earth in that area by using a tractor with a grader blade, although this may have occurred while he was executing turns during the preparation of his property for planting. 
     
      
    68 Clearly the levelling of the low mound facilitated the flow of water from the plaintiffs' to the defendants' property. It must have been obvious to the plaintiffs as well as the defendants that, given the increased flow of water consequent upon the plaintiffs' earthworks, removal of the low mound of earth would ensure that water would career from the plaintiffs' to the defendants' land, as soon as there was heavy rain. 
     
      
       
      The effect of the laying of roadbase on water flow 
      
    69 Mr Galea says that shortly after he saw Mr Micallef demolish the ""embankment"", he built a post and wire fence along the boundary. There is evidence, conflicting to some extent, about an argument between Mr Galea and Mr Micallef, while Mr Galea and his son were building the fence. I doubt that either of the competing versions of the conversation is completely accurate, but it is unnecessary for me to resolve the matter.  
     
      
    70 Shortly after the fencing had been completed, in October 1999, Mr Galea arranged for about four to six 15-tonne loads of roadbase to be distributed along the driveway, and he then levelled it. Mr Galea said in evidence that, after the roadbase had been laid, the driveway was the same height as the embankment had been before it was demolished by Mr Micallef. 
     
      
    71 Mr Blinman inspected the site and interviewed Mr Galea, as well as Mr Micallef, in July 2000. He reported that the driveway had a rutted surface, and that the first 82 m of the driveway, measured from Yarramundi Lane, had a soil surface, and the following 118 m had a roadbase gravel surface consisting of rotor-milled asphalt and basalt roadbase gravels. For the first 110 metres from the Lane, the driveway surface was about 300 mm below the surface of the plaintiffs' land immediately adjacent to it, and was about 300 mm above the defendants' land on the opposite side of the driveway. At a point about 110 metres from the Lane, the surface of the driveway became level with the plaintiffs' land but remained higher than the defendants' land. At about 116 metres from the Lane the driveway rose to be about 300 to 400 mm above the plaintiffs' ground level. This level was maintained until about 188 m from the Lane, where the driveway surface against fell to be about 300 mm below that of the plaintiffs' land. 
     
      
    72 Mr Blinman excavated six test pits, to ascertain the depth of the roadbase on the driveway. He found that in one of the test pits, and located about 143 m from the Lane, the depth of the roadbase was 410 mm, with an additional 70 mm of gravelly soil fill, although at other points the depth of roadbase ranged from 60 to 180 mm. He saw this data as pointing to ""the infill of a broad depression along the driveway alignment with road imported base gravels"". 
     
      
    73 There can be no doubt that the raising of the driveway has affected the flow of water. Dr Webb and Mr Downes agree that over a period of 30 m (chainages 60 and 90 m in Mr McKinlay's survey plan) the driveway constitutes a constraint to flow across the boundary, whereas the level of the fence line is a constraint at other places. They also agree that the maximum possible depth of ponding on the plaintiffs' property that could have been caused by the placement of roadbase on the driveway is 200 mm. But it would be overly hasty to conclude, as Mr Blinman did, that the flooding problem on the plaintiffs' property was directly caused by the raising of the driveway. It is relevant to inquire whether, as Mr Galea says, the water gathered on the plaintiffs' land and ran across onto the defendants' land to the same extent, after the raising of the driveway, as during the period 1986 to 1996, or whether the raised driveway now causes more ponding to the plaintiffs' land than occurred before 1996.  
     
      
    74 The most important evidence on the subject was the evidence of Dr Webb. He used the survey information provided by Mr McKinlay to prepare graphs of surface profiles and possible fence line profiles. He concluded that the driveway (on its southern side) may now be up to 40 mm (upper profile) or 80 mm (lower profile) higher than the previous level of the ""embankment"" which ran along the fence line, although he said that the work on the driveway may not have raised of the level at all. I accept this evidence. 
     
      
       
      Answers to the agreed statement of issues 
      
    75 Having made my findings of fact on the principal issues in contention, I shall now answer the questions raised in the agreed statement of issues. 
     
      
    76 Have the acts of the plaintiffs had the effect of concentrating the flow of surface water from the plaintiffs' land onto the defendants' land? 
     
      
    77 I have given an affirmative answer this question. 
     
      
    78 Did the deposit of road fill alter the level of the plaintiffs' land so as to stop the surface water coming onto the defendants' land with the consequence that the plaintiffs' land has suffered increased flooding?  
     
      
    79 The deposit of road fill did not alter the level of the plaintiffs' land, but it did stop surface water coming onto the defendants' land, causing increased flooding on the plaintiffs' land. 
     
      
    80 Did the alleged embankment or driveway alter the natural flow of surface water so as to stop surface water coming from the plaintiffs' land onto the defendants' land with the consequence that the plaintiffs' land suffered increased flooding? 
     
      
    81 The ""embankment"" that existed until Mr Micallef levelled it altered the natural flow of surface water so as to create ponding, to a limited degree, on the plaintiffs' land. The driveway also did so, particularly after it was elevated by the deposit of roadbase. 
     
      
    82 Was the action of the defendants in either maintaining the embankment or alternatively placing the road fill a natural or reasonable use of the defendants' land or reasonable measure of protection so as to absolve them from responsibility for any damage caused to the plaintiffs? 
     
      
    83 This is the central remaining question. The defendants did not maintain the ""embankment"", which was levelled by Mr Micallef, but instead they elevated their driveway in a position adjacent to where the ""embankment"" had been levelled. The question is whether their action was a natural or reasonable use of their own land, or a reasonable measure of protection of it. 
     
      
    84 The elevation of the roadway was not a natural use of the land. The defendants' case is that it was a reasonable measure for protection of their land. By elevating the driveway they prevented, to a significant degree, water flowing from the plaintiffs' land to their land in times of heavy rain. By doing so they certainly protected their land, by avoiding or limiting the risk of damage to the their crops from flooding. In my opinion, their conduct amounted to reasonable protection of their land. 
     
      
    85 Several factors made it reasonable for the defendants to act as they did. Over the previous two years the plaintiffs had substantially changed the use of their land and in doing so they conducted substantial earthworks which had the effect of increasing the water flow to the defendants' land during periods of heavy rain. Their new irrigation system also contributed to this outcome. And, after the earthworks had been completed, Mr Micallef demolished the low mound, along that part of the boundary where the water was most likely to flow onto the defendants' land, which had given the defendants some limited protection from water flow. It was reasonable for the defendants to take an appropriate measure to protect their property from the risk of increased flooding caused by the combination of the steps taken by the plaintiffs. Given the very poor relationship between the parties, it was not unreasonable for the defendants to act without consultation. 
     
      
    86 In my view, it would not have been reasonable for the defendants to construct an obstacle to water flow which would put the plaintiffs in a worse position than they had been in before they had undertaken the conduct which justified a response by the defendants. This raises the question whether the defendants have gone too far, by building up their driveway to a height ""quite possibly” 40 mm higher than the ""embankment"", and ""possibly"" 80 mm higher.  
     
      
    87 I find it impossible, on the evidence before me, to decide between the various possibilities presented by Dr Webb's evidence, which I have accepted on this point. In my opinion, however, is unnecessary to do so. I have formed the view that because the plaintiffs' earthworks, change of use and irrigation had increased the water flow onto the defendants' land during times of heavy rain, quite apart from the levelling of the ""embankment"", the reasonableness of the defendants’ response is not to be gauged solely by comparing the height of the driveway with the height of the ""embankment"". Taking into account the expert and lay evidence and my own observations, I cannot say that the driveway was elevated so high that the defendants' response was disproportionate to the threat to their land posed by the totality of the plaintiffs' conduct. In my opinion, the defendants have taken no more than a reasonable measure to protect their land. 
     
      
    88 The plaintiffs drew attention to the small cost of remedial work, balanced against the extent of the flooding caused by the elevated driveway to the plaintiffs' land, and they contended that the existence of the raised driveway did not confer a benefit on the defendants' property. I disagree with this submission. The question is whether it was reasonable for the defendants to respond in the way they did, and the value of the remedial work (which would need to be carried out only if the defendants had been unreasonable) is not relevant to that question. Further, there is evidence that the elevation to the driveway has prevented surface water from flowing onto the defendants' land, and that in itself is a benefit to the defendants. 
     
      
       
      Conclusions 
      
    89 I have decided that the defendants have established a complete defence to the plaintiffs' action for nuisance. Since, in my view, they have acted reasonably in the circumstances, having regard to the plaintiffs' conduct, there is no ground in all the circumstances for liability in negligence. It follows that the proceedings should be dismissed.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 HEYDON JA:  
      
       
       On 19 December 2000 after a trial without jury Flannery ADCJ, QC, convicted Benjamin Ralph Blanchette and Christian Joshua Blanchette on the following charges, namely that they: 
        
        
         
         “1. On 31 December 1998 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, being then in company with each other and one unknown male, did rob Hamish McManus of forty dollars cash, the property of Hamish McManus. 
         
        
        
         
         2. On 31 December 1998 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, being then in company with each other and one unknown male, did rob Paul Hampsey of four hundred dollars cash and one ‘Rusty’ brand wallet, the property of Paul Hampsey.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     2 On 6 March 2001 each accused was sentenced to eighteen months’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of twelve months. On 11 May 2001 the trial judge ordered the non-parole period to be served by way of home detention.  
      
       
     3 Each accused has appealed against conviction. The Crown has appealed against the sentences on the ground of manifest inadequacy.  
      
       
        
       Background 
       
     4 Mr Hampsey and Mr McManus testified that at about 2.30am on 1 January 1998, they were near the War Memorial in Hyde Park, Sydney. Mr Hampsey said he was punched three times, and that his wallet containing eight $50 notes was taken from him. Mr McManus said he was hit once on the head and then kicked by three men as he lay on the ground. They demanded money. He gave them his wallet; they removed the money in it; and they threw his wallet back at him as they ran away. Mr McManus chased them into Bathurst Street in a westerly direction. The accused were shortly afterwards apprehended by police officers in a passing police car in Castlereagh Street near the corner of Bathurst Street.  
      
       
     5 In essence the Crown case was that Mr McManus chased the three men who had attacked him and Mr Hampsey, and that the police had arrested two of those he was chasing. The arresting police noticed Mr McManus chasing two men in Bathurst Street and continued to observe them from Bathurst Street travelling west. They said they arrested the two men Mr McManus was chasing. Mr Hampsey’s eight $50 notes were crisp. Eight $50 notes were found in Benjamin Blanchette’s possession. There was police evidence that they were “as good as brand new, very fresh”. Four of them had consecutive numbers.  
      
       
     6 The appellants said they had not run west down Bathurst Street, but were moving east. Benjamin Blanchette said that he took the notes out of his bank account via EFTPOS over the previous period. The appellants relied on their good character. They also contended that Mr McManus had erred in identifying them because he had been drinking, because there was unsatisfactory lighting in Hyde Park, because of the speed of the assault and because of his injuries. The appellants also relied on the fact that one John McGinness, who did not give evidence, handed to the police on 7 March 1999 a black wallet containing documents apparently belonging to Mr Hampsey, together with $406.80.  
      
       
     7 While the trial judge did not make findings of fact in any very clear way, he did appear to accept the Crown case.  
      
       
        
       Grounds of appeal on conviction 
       
     8 The appellants expressed their grounds of appeal as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “1. His Honour erred in respect of the  
         onus of proof 
         . His Honour is not seen to find that the onus of proof was on the Crown. 
         
        
        
         
         2. His Honour erred in respect of the  
         standard of proof 
         . At the time of reaching and giving Judgment the trial miscarried when His Honour convicted on the following basis ‘ … but I do find the offences proved and  
         I think 
          I should return the verdict of guilty.’ 
         
        
        
         
         3.  
         Character 
          
          
         His Honour failed to address himself adequately as to the good character of both appellants. Notwithstanding that His Honour adverted to evidence of character, His Honour does not expose his reasoning process as to how (s 17 Criminal Procedure Act), notwithstanding the evidence of good character, a guilty verdict was reached. 
         
        
        
         
         4. In directing himself as to the  
         identification evidence 
          His Honour is not seen in his judgment to discharge the obligation imposed by s 116 of the Evidence Act in respect of the intoxication of, and injury to the head of, the alleged victim Mr McManus. Notwithstanding that His Honour adverted to the need for caution before accepting identification evidence as reliable, His Honour does not expose his reasoning process as to how (s 17 Criminal Procedure Act), notwithstanding the warning, a guilty verdict was reached. 
         
        
        
         
         In respect of the question of identification His Honour is not seen in his judgment to have regard to weaknesses in the identification. His Honour failed to give himself the warning required by s 165(1)(c) Evidence Act, such requirement for a warning arising in consequence of the evidence that McManus was intoxicated and had suffered an injury to the head. 
         
        
        
         
         5. The Trial Judge  
         did not consider the cases of the two appellants separately. 
         
        
        
         
         6. The Trial Judge failed to make any findings of fact as to the basis upon which he found Christian Blanchette guilty and, further, no explanation of the law upon which His Honour relied. 
         
        
        
         
         7. The Trial Judge failed to make adequate findings of fact as to the basis upon which he found Benjamin Blanchette guilt and, further, no explanation of the law upon which His Honour relied. 
         
        
        
         
         8. His Honour  
         misunderstood the evidence 
          of Benjamin Blanchette thereby causing the trial to miscarry. His Honour at p 22.4 of his judgment, having quoted part of the evidence of the appellant Benjamin Blanchette stated, in relation to the last question of the quotation, ‘And there was no answer given’. Contrary to His Honour’s understanding of the evidence the transcript records that the particular question was answered, ‘That is correct’. 
         
        
        
         
         9.  
         The Wallet Containing $406.80 
         
        
        
         
         A. Evidence was given in the Crown case that nine weeks after the robberies, namely, on 7 March 1999 (Clean-up Australia day) Mr John McGinness found in Hyde Park a wallet containing $406.80 and items of identification belonging to Mr Hampsey. Unless the prosecution could prove beyond reasonable doubt that the money contained in this wallet did not belong to Mr Hampsey, the Crown case (which depended for conviction to a most significant, indeed vital degree on proving that the $400.00 located on the person of the appellant Benjamin Blanchette had been stolen from the wallet of Mr Hampsey) could not succeed. 
         
        
        
         
         B. His Honour failed to make any findings as to whether the wallet or the money therein (found on 7 March 1999) belonged to the victim Hampsey. Further, His Honour did not make any findings as to the contents of that wallet nor whether the money contained therein was the money the subject of the charge or not. This issue was fundamental and went directly to the issue of guilt. 
         
        
        
         
         C. His Honour failed to expose his reasoning process as to how (s 17 Criminal Procedure Act), notwithstanding the evidence of the wallet containing $406.80 having been found, a guilty verdict was reached. His Honour said only, ‘… the events of 7 March in Hyde Park must have been and have to be seriously considered’. 
         
        
        
         
         This evidence was evidence (or an hypothesis) ‘consistent with innocence.’ His Honour did not state how he ‘seriously considered’ the finding of the $406.80. 
         
        
        
         
         10.  
         Fresh Evidence 
         
        
        
         
         The appellants have located, and obtained a statement from Mr John McGinness (finder of the wallet, referred to [in] 9 above, on 7 March 1999 during Clean-Up Australia Day). 
         
        
        
         
         Mr McGinness is able to give evidence which would call into question the correctness of the appellants’ convictions. There is a significant possibility, that His Honour acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellants if the fresh evidence had been before him at the trial. 
         
        
        
         
         11.  
         Election To Have Trial By Judge Alone 
         
        
        
         
         His Honour did not satisfy himself before the commencement of the trial that the appellants had sought and received advice in relation to the election to be tried by Judge alone (and thereby failed to comply with s 16 Criminal Procedure Act). The trial commenced on 9 November 2000 (T 9/11/00, p 1) and His Honour did not consider the question of satisfying himself as required by s 16(1)(b) Criminal Procedure Act, until the conclusion of the second day of the trial on 10/11/00, T 90.27 (after both alleged victims had given and completed their evidence). 
         
        
        
         
         12.  
         Incompetence of Counsel 
         
        
        
         
         (i) The appellants were both charged with two counts of robbery in company pursuant to s 97(1) Crimes Act. The maximum penalty for an offence under s 97(1) Crimes Act is imprisonment for twenty years. The appellants were jointly represented at trial by Mr A Radojev who led Mr K Newell of counsel. Mr Radojev was absent from the trial during part of the prosecution case, the whole of the defence case and the whole of the Crown Final Address. At the conclusion of the Crown Final Address a short adjournment was granted to the defence to await the arrival of Mr Radojev who then made the Final Address on behalf of the appellants. 
         
        
        
         
         There was no daily transcripts of the evidence available to the defence during the trial, and there was no instructing solicitor or clerk present during the trial for the reason that counsel appeared on a direct access basis. 
         
        
        
         
         (ii) The trial of the appellants was set down to commence at 10.00am on Monday 6 November 2000. After Mention of the matter at approximately 9.30am, counsel and the appellants were at the Court awaiting the allocation of a Judge in order that the trial might commence. At approximately 2.30pm on Monday 6 November 2000, no Judge having been allocated, the trial was adjourned for hearing at 10.00am the following morning. When the appellants and defence counsel left Court shortly after 2.30pm on Monday 6 November 2000 they were unaware and had yet to be informed of the finding of the wallet in Hyde Park on 7 March 1999. 
         
        
        
         
         At approximately 4.00pm on Monday 6 November 2000 the Crown Prosecutor, Mr Govind, telephoned Mr Newell and informed him that the wallet had been found on 7 March 1999. This telephone call was the first occasion on which the defence learnt that the wallet and money had been found by Mr McGinness. Police witnesses gave evidence at the trial that they were unable to locate Mr McGinness. 
         
        
        
         
         Evidence from Mr McGinness would have been vital in the trial for the reason that the Crown case, by necessary implication, was that the purported finding of the wallet by Mr McGinness was arranged and manufactured by the defence.  
         
        
        
         
         The significance of the evidence that could be given by Mr McGinness was such that a fair trial could not be obtained until investigation by the defence as to the whereabouts of Mr McGinness and the circumstances of his finding the subject matter of the robbery. It was incompetent of counsel then appearing, in the circumstances, not to apply for an adjournment in order to locate Mr McGinness and consider calling him as a witness for the defence. 
         
        
        
         
         (iii) Counsel appearing for the appellants at the trial did not lead any evidence as to good character except that neither appellant had any convictions for criminal offences. There were numerous witnesses available to give direct evidence as to the character of both appellants, including that they were not the sort of persons who would commit the crimes alleged against them. 
         
        
        
         
         (iv) Counsel appearing for the appellants failed to raise as an issue during the prosecution case the unexplained failure of police to conduct a fingerprint examination of the money located on the person of the appellant, Mr Benjamin Blanchette, at the time of his arrest. 
         
        
        
         
         (v) Counsel appearing for the appellants failed to raise as an issue during the prosecution case the unexplained failure of police to retain and forensically examine (including fingerprint examination and otherwise) the wallet and the contents therein which was handed by Mr McGinness to Constable Gill on 7 March 1999 at Woolloomooloo Police Station. 
         
        
        
         
         (vi) Counsel appearing for the appellants failed to raise as an issue during the prosecution case the unexplained failure of police to notify the defence that the wallet and money had been found before the date for the commencement of the trial. 
         
        
        
         
         13. The verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory.” 
         
        
        
       The Crown concessions 
       
     9 The appellants filed and served detailed written submissions in support of these grounds of appeal. While some of their criticisms are more powerful than others, it is not necessary to go to the detail of all of them, because the Crown has conceded that Grounds 1-4, 6-7 and 9B-C are made out and justify allowing the appeal. Because of those concessions, the Crown did not deal with Grounds 8, 9A and 10-12. It contended that there was no merit in Ground 5 or Ground 13. 
      
       
     10 The appellants contended that in these circumstances there should not be a new trial but that acquittals should be entered. The Crown sought orders for new trials. That issue is thus the sole remaining live issue before this Court: the Crown appeal against sentence obviously lapses. 
      
       
     11 On the appeal the appellants tendered without objection the following evidence not tendered at the trial: an affidavit of Peter Colin Proctor dated 27 September 2001 (the point of which was to annex a statement of John Michael McGinness dated 8 August 2001); an affidavit of Benjamin Ralph Blanchette dated 27 September 2001 (which set out facts relating to some of his criticisms of his lawyers and some character evidence); an affidavit of Christian Joshua Blanchette dated 27 September 2001 (which was to the same effect); and an affidavit of Kenneth Richard Newell dated 21 November 2001 but in fact filed on 2 November 2001 (he was one of the counsel who represented the appellants at the trial, and his affidavit, apart from justifying one of his decisions at the trial, went to prove in what way the Crown had put its case at the trial). 
      
       
        
       The parties’ submissions 
       
     12 The criticisms made by the appellants, except those which relate to Ground 13, the evidence of Mr McGinness and character evidence, largely go to matters which are independent of the substantive strength or weakness of the Crown case. They go to various alleged errors of the trial judge or counsel which, though some may be potentially important, are of an adjectival character only. The arguments thus centred on Ground 13 and the new evidence.  
      
       
     13 In chief the appellants submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is submitted that having regard to the whole of the facts of the case his Honour’s verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory. The appellants would respectfully refer inter alia to the following matters: 
         
        
        
         
         (i) The prosecution failed to conduct a fingerprint examination or any forensic examination of Mr Hampsey’s wallet handed to police by Mr McGinness on 7 March 1999, the wallet not having been retained as an exhibit; 
         
        
        
         
         (ii) The prosecution failed to conduct a fingerprint examination of the money located on the appellant Benjamin Blanchette at the time of his arrest. 
         
        
        
         
         (iii) Having regard to the condition of Mr McManus (intoxicated and suffering a head injury) at the time of his purported identification of the appellants, no attempt or request of the appellants to take part in a line up parade for the purpose of identification (or non-identification) by Mr Hampsey. Detective Heap considered that he had sufficient evidence of identification (an identification having been made by Mr McManus) and that he did not need further identification by Mr Hampsey. Detective [Heap] gave the following evidence at T.111.21 on 15/1/00: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. I suggest to you that the reason you didn’t ask Mr Hampsey on the evening to assist in identifying anybody was because he was too drunk to identify anybody? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. No, the reason that I did not hash [sic] the idea, because it is a very important point, in every investigation was  
           because I was very confident of the identification I already had 
            and the evidence I had was very strong.’ [Emphasis added] 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         It is submitted that the identification was not a matter for Detective Heap to consider that he had sufficient evidence to satisfy  
         him 
          – it was a matter for determination by the  
         jury 
          (in this case by His Honour). 
         
        
        
         
         Transcending all other matters favouring the appellants in the trial is the evidence of the wallet being found by Mr McGinness on 7 March 1999. We might remind Your Honours that the Crown case in relation to the finding of the wallet was never put to Christian Blanchette (see submissions in relation to Ground 12(ii) above) and the only cross-examination of Benjamin Blanchette in accordance with the principles in Browne v Dunn was that quoted in those submissions.  
         
        
        
         
         It is submitted that there can be no doubt that the wallet and contents thereof found by Mr McGinness on 7 March 1999, were the property of Mr Hampsey – the wallet contained amongst other things, Mr Hampsey’s driver’s licence, credit cards etc. In Mr Hampsey’s evidence in chief he gave the following evidence at T.9.01 on 10/11/00: 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Was it indeed your wallet? 
         
        
        
         
         A. My mother said it was my wallet. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Would she know your wallet? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes she would. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Was there any money in it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes there was money in the wallet. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. $400? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Were they crisp notes? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I don’t – the notes my Mum said that they looked slightly aged as did the rest of the wallet.’ 
         
        
        
         
         The defence submission is this: Clearly if the money in the wallet handed to Constable Gill on 7 March 1999 is the money that was in Hampsey’s wallet when he was robbed, then the appellants are not guilty – indeed it was essential for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the money found in the wallet was  
         not 
          that of Hampsey (and, we might add, essential for His Honour to so find before he could move to conviction.) 
         
        
        
         
         It is submitted that if the Court admits into evidence on the appeal the fresh evidence of Mr McGinness, the Crown is unable to eliminate the reasonable possibility that the two appellants are innocent. The verdict of the Trial Judge, it is submitted, must then, with respect, be unsafe and unsatisfactory and a verdict of acquittal should be entered.” 
          
           
          
         
        
       
     14 The Crown submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “The appellant submits that the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. The appellant points to a number of deficiencies in the investigation. The respondent acknowledges that fingerprint examination was not conducted on either the notes found in the pocket of the appellant Benjamin Blanchette or on the notes/wallet found by Mr McGinness. It is also acknowledged that police did not conduct an identification parade and that Mr Hampsey did not identify either appellant. As a consequence the defence were and will be (should a re-trial be ordered) entitled to submit to the jury that the Crown had failed to establish any physical link between Mr Hampsey and the notes found in the pocket of the appellant Benjamin Blanchette. Further, it can be submitted that Mr Hampsey has not identified either appellant. 
         
        
        
         
         Whilst the appellants’ position was unlikely to have been improved by appropriate identification and fingerprinting procedures, this may not have been the position in regard to the fingerprinting of the notes within the wallet. Fingerprinting of these notes could theoretically have established a link between them and Mr Hampsey. Had Mr Hampsey’s fingerprints been found on the notes within the wallet that would have absolutely discounted the notes found in the pocket of the appellant Benjamin Blanchette as being proceeds of the robbery. However, there is no guarantee that fingerprint testing on any notes would have produced positive findings. In any event, a lost opportunity such as this does not, of itself, generally provide a basis for a conclusion that the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         The respondent submits that the real task is to determine the extent and quality of the evidence available to the trial Judge. This Court must assess whether in all the circumstances of the case the verdict was reasonable and supported by appropriate evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         The essence of the Crown case is the evidence provided by Mr McManus. If Mr McManus is accepted as a witness of truth and reliability, his evidence establishes that he chased the appellants and an unknown third person through Hyde Park, down Bathurst Street and into Castlereagh Street. His evidence was that he lost sight of them for but a few seconds at most after they turned into Castlereagh Street. 
         
        
        
         
         Considerable support is found for Mr McManus in the evidence of Sergeant Rutherford and chief Inspector Sutton. These Officers gave evidence that they saw the appellants running in Bathurst (between Elizabeth and Castlereagh Streets – heading west) and Castlereagh Streets with Mr McManus running behind, pointing to the appellants and shouting to police to ‘Stop them’ (the appellants). Neither Officer saw anyone else in the immediate vicinity. Each Officer maintained that he did not lose sight of the three men from the time of their first observation in Bathurst Street until they stopped the appellants in Castlereagh Street. 
         
        
        
         
         Detective Senior Constables Albury and Heap arrived on the scene in Castlereagh Street soon after the appellants had been stopped. Each of these Officers noted that the appellants and Mr McManus were breathing heavily and sweating. 
         
        
        
         
         The case against the appellant Christian Blanchette also includes an ERISP conducted by Detective Senior Constable Albury. In this interview, Christian Blanchette said that they had been at McDonald’s near the Globe Hotel in Park Street and he seemed to suggest that he and his brother were accosted by Mr McManus in Elizabeth Street, that they ran down Bathurst Street and into Castlereagh Street to avoid him. 
         
        
        
         
         In his evidence at trial Christian Blanchette states that he and his brother ate at McDonalds on corner Liverpool and George Streets, that they went north up George Street, east in Wilmot Lane, north in Pitt Street, east in Bathurst Street and then south in Castlereagh Street. This version is inconsistent with his ERISP, with Mc McManus and with Chief Inspector Sutton and Sgt. Rutherford. 
         
        
        
         
         Benjamin Blanchette did not participate in an ERISP. At trial he stated that he and his brother ate at McDonalds adjacent to Planet Hollywood in George Street. He then detailed the some route to Castlereagh Street as outlined in the preceding paragraph. As stated this was inconsistent with Mr McManus and Officers Sutton and Rutherford.  
         
        
        
         
         The strength of the Crown case is found in the circumstantial evidence of Mr McManus and Officers Sutton and Rutherford. Taken together and if accepted this evidence is capable of establishing a continuity of circumstances from robbery to detention in Castlereagh Street which clearly proves the involvement of these appellants. The Crown does not have to prove that the $400-00, found in the pocket of Benjamin Blanchette, was the $400 taken from Mr Hampsey. The evidence of panic and flight after the robbery provides evidence that is capable of supporting the inference that the stolen wallet was either thrown away or dropped during flight. This would explain its location in the park if the jury accepts that the wallet remained undetected in the park for three months before its location by Mr McGinness. 
         
        
        
         
         The offence committed against the victims was serious and the evidence is capable of establishing all the essential elements of the charged offence. A re-trial will allow the ‘fresh evidence’ to be called and tested.”  
         
        
       
     15 The appellants submitted in reply: 
      
       
        
         
         “The defence concedes that if the Crown chose to put its case on the alternative basis outlined in the submissions, technically there is evidence that could if accepted by the jury) establish the charges. But, it is submitted, there is such an inconsistency in this approach when put to a jury, that any prosecution would fail. No jury, it is submitted, would accept a Crown case based upon two such alternative, competing and completely inconsistent bases. 
         
        
        
         
         It would seem that the Crown would propose to put the case before the jury that the appellants committed the robbery and were subsequently arrested with the proceeds of the robbery in their possession. But it would be put to the jury that if the jury did not accept that they were in possession of the proceeds of the robbery, and the money in their possession was honestly obtained, the jury would alternatively be satisfied that the appellants were guilty on the basis of the other evidence in the case. 
         
        
        
         
         It is submitted that what the Crown proposes to do if there is a new trial is ‘to make a new case which was not made at the first trial’ (per Dawson J in R v King (1986) 161 CLR 423 at 433). 
         
        
        
         
         We refer to the evidence given in the trial generally and to the affidavit of Mr Newell, counsel appearing for the appellants at the trial, sworn 2 November 2001 and filed herein. It is clear from a reading of the evidence in the trial (and as a convenient summary, the affidavit of Mr Newell filed herein) that the Crown case at the trial was that the eight $50.00 notes the subject of the robbery allegations made against the two appellants were the very notes in their possession when arrested. 
         
        
        
         
         Furthermore, it would appear from the Crown’s submissions in this appeal (see page 9) that the Crown would propose at a second trial to attack Benjamin Blanchette and Christian Blanchette again in cross-examination in relation to their explanation for their possession of the eight $50.00 notes, and again to lead evidence from Mr Tenison as to the unlikelihood of their obtaining $300.00 in ‘crisp, new’ $50.00 notes from the EFTPOS at the hotel at Liverpool – no doubt also alleging in a second trial that Benjamin Blanchette ‘prevaricated’ for a period before finally answering questions about his need for the money (see Crown submissions in relation to Ground 8). 
         
        
        
         
         That is, the Crown, it seems, will attack the appellants on the matters which establish the link between the presence of the eight $50.00 notes on the person of Benjamin Blanchette and the means by which he obtained that money – and after all that, putting to the jury ‘even if you believe them in relation to their possession of the sum of the eight $50.00 notes, it is still, as an alternative, open to you to convict on the balance of the evidence’. 
         
        
        
         
         It would be put further: ‘the Crown alleges they stole this money, these eight $50.00 notes which are shown in the police photographs in evidence, but if you are not satisfied that they did, the Crown says they stole other money being eight different $50.00 bank notes’. With respect, it can be readily seen why the Crown prosecutor at the first trial, did not put the Crown case on this alternative basis. 
         
        
        
         
         (The Crown would, it is submitted, be seeking in a re-trial to obtain a conviction not only upon a basis different from that of the first trial, but in relation to property different from that alleged in the indictment. The Crown would, in that event, it is submitted, necessarily need to seek amendment of the indictment.)  
         
        
       
     16 The appellants relied on the following authorities. In King v R (1986) 161 CLR 423 at 433.5-.6 Dawson J said: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is well established that the discretion to order a new trial should not be exercised when the evidence in the court below was not sufficiently cogent to justify a conviction or to allow the Crown to supplement a case which has proved to be defective. In particular, the Crown should not be given an opportunity to make a new case which was not made at the first trial: R v Wilkes 
          [(1948) 77 CLR 511 at 518].” 
           
         
        
       
       
       In the same case Murphy J said at 426.8-427.5: 
        
         
         “Under s 8(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), a new trial should only be ordered where it would more adequately remedy the miscarriage of justice than any other order the court is empowered to make. 
         
        
        
         
         A new trial is not the inevitable result of a successful appeal against conviction. The onus rests squarely with the prosecution to show the court that a new trial is the most appropriate remedy. In Cheatley v The Queen [[1981] Tas SR 123 at 137-138], the correct approach is clearly spelled out by Everett J: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘My conclusion is that there is no presumption in favour of a second trial being ordered when an appeal succeeds, and that the discretion of the court must be exercised on a consideration of all the relevant facts and circumstances. The accused should be accorded neither more nor less personal consideration than the overall justice of the case requires in recognition of the public interest in the fair and impartial administration of criminal justice. I do not accept the counter argument on behalf of the prosecution that ‘the ordinary course should apply’. I do not consider, for reasons I have expressed, that there should be any ‘ordinary’ course. Each case is individual and should be determined on the basis of the facts and all relevant considerations which apply to it – not to a different case. It is a negation of the wide discretion vested by statute in the Tasmanian Court of Criminal Appeal to suppose that a common mould exists and that all cases should be judged within its framework.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (Section 404(1) of the Criminal Code (Tas) is in substantially similar terms to s 8(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act (NSW).) 
         
        
        
         
         Where there was insufficient evidence at the original trial to warrant a conviction or if the evidence that will be available at any new trial is insufficient then it would be contrary to the interests of justice to order a new trial. The appellant is entitled to an acquittal as of right.” 
         
        
        
       In  
       R v Jiminez 
        (1992) 173 CLR 572 at 590 McHugh J said: 
        
         
         “But the sufficiency of evidence to support the charge is not the only factor to be considered. Other factors lead to the conclusion that, despite there being evidence which, if accepted, would make out a charge of culpable driving, a new trial should not be ordered. First, as a general rule, a new trial should not be ordered to enable the Crown to make a new case at a second trial [R v Wilkes (1948) 77 CLR 511 at 518; King v The Queen (1986) 161 CLR 423 at 433]. In the present case, a second trial would allow the Crown to make a case different from that which it put to the jury at the first trial. Secondly, the events which gave rise to the charge occurred nearly four years ago, and it is nearly two years since the applicant was convicted. Thirdly, the applicant was sentenced to six months imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention. Prior to being granted bail pending his appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, the applicant served four weekends in gaol pursuant to the order of the learned trial judge. Fourthly, the Crown has always accepted that the accident which gave rise to the charge of culpable driving arose only from the applicant’s falling asleep. The Crown has not suggested that speed or alcohol played any part in the car leaving the road. When all the circumstances are taken into account, the interests of justice do not require that the applicant should be put to the expense, stress and inconvenience of a new trial so that the Crown can put a case which it did not put at the first trial. The general rule that a new trial will be ordered so that the Crown can put a different case at a second trial must prevail.” 
         
        
        
       The appellants also referred to  
       R v Murrell  
       [2001] NSWCCA 179 at [23].  
        
       
     17 A useful authority not referred to is Lord Diplock’s advice in Reid v R [1980] AC 343 at 349-350: 
      
       
        
         
         “Their Lordships have already indicated in disposing of the instant appeal that the interest of justice that is served by the power to order a new trial is the interest of the public in Jamaica that those persons who are guilty of serious crimes should be brought to justice and not escape it merely became of some technical blunder by the judge in the conduct of the trial or in his summing up to the jury. Save in circumstances so exceptional that their Lordships cannot readily envisage them it ought not to be exercised where, as in the instant case, a reason for setting aside the verdict is that the evidence adduced at the trial was insufficient to justify a conviction by a reasonable jury even if properly directed. It is not in the interests of justice as administered under the common law system of criminal procedure that the prosecution should be given another chance to cure evidential deficiencies in its case against the defendant. At the other extreme, where the evidence against the defendant at the trial was so strong that any reasonable jury if properly directed would have convicted the defendant, prima facie the more appropriate course is to apply the proviso to section 14(1) and dismiss the appeal instead of incurring the expense and inconvenience to witnesses and jurors which would be involved in another trial. 
         
        
        
         
         In cases which fall between these two extremes there may be many factors deserving of consideration, some operating against and some in favour of the exercise of the power. The seriousness or otherwise of the offence must always be a relevant factor: so may its prevalence; and where the previous trial was prolonged and complex, the expense and the length of time for which the court and jury would be involved in a fresh hearing may also be relevant considerations. So too is the consideration that any criminal trial is to some extent an ordeal for the defendant, which the defendant ought not to be condemned to undergo for a second time through no fault of his own unless the interests of justice require that he should do so. The length of time that will have elapsed between the offence and the new trial if one be ordered may vary in importance from case to case, though having regard to the onus of proof which lies upon the prosecution lapse of time may tend to operate to its disadvantage rather than to that of the defendant. Nevertheless there may be cases where evidence which tended to support the defence at the first trial would not be available at the new trial and, if this were so, it would be a powerful factor against ordering a new trial. 
         
        
        
         
         The strength of the case presented by the prosecution at the previous trial is always one of the factors to be taken into consideration but, except in the two extreme cases that have been referred to, the weight to be attached to this factor may vary widely from case to case … .” 
         
        
       
       
       Mr Andersen QC who appeared with Mr Heathcote on behalf of the appellants supplemented their written submissions and put, with respect, powerful and helpful arguments in support of the points made. 
        
        
       Orders 
       
     18 The Crown could attempt to prove a case that the appellants robbed the victims and that the money found in the possession of Benjamin Blanchette was Mr Hampsey’s money. Alternatively, the Crown could attempt to prove a case that the appellants robbed the victims, and that case could be made out through the eye-witness evidence of the victims and the police officers even if the Crown failed to prove that the money found on Benjamin Blanchette was Mr Hampsey’s money.  
      
       
     19 The appellants’ submission that there is an inconsistency in these approaches is invalid. They are not “alternative, competing and completely inconsistent”. The former way of putting the case includes the latter, but adds something. If the Crown could establish that the money found on Benjamin Blanchette was Mr Hampsey’s, that would powerfully confirm the evidence of Mr McManus. But failure by the Crown to establish that the money found on Benjamin Blanchette does not necessarily mean that the trier of fact will or ought to reject the evidence of Mr McManus and other prosecution witnesses.  
      
       
     20 The appellants’ submission that the Crown proposes to make a new case which was not made at the first trial has only technical force, but no substantive merit. Even if the Crown at the trial only put its case one way – at its highest, without falling back on any other position – that would not have prevented the trial judge from rejecting that case but accepting the lesser case now pointed to. The Crown is not seeking to make a contradictory case or a case on new and different evidence. 
      
       
     21 The appellants’ submission that the Crown will argue either that the appellants robbed Mr Hampsey of $400, or attacked the victims but had in their possession $400 stolen from someone else, is invalid. The appellants are not charged with stealing $400 from anyone else. They are charged with robbing $40 from McMcManus and $400 from Mr Hampsey. Evidence directed only to proving some dishonest acquisition of money from persons other than Mr Hampsey or Mr McManus would be inadmissible. The Crown case, whichever of the two ways it might be put, would fail unless it could convince the trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt that $40 and $400 were removed from the victims, even if one or both of the appellants only retained possession of the money for a short time. Even if Mr McGinness found the wallet as he says he did, it is possible, and a trier of fact could be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt, that Mr Hampsey’s wallet was removed from him as he lay on the ground, but that the taker then threw it away or dropped it when Mr McManus gave chase, and that it was later found by Mr McGinness. 
      
       
     22 It must be borne in mind that a decision by this Court to refuse to order acquittals and to order a new trial does not mean that there will in fact be a new trial. That is a matter for the Crown authorities to consider.  
      
       
     23 The factors favourable to the appellants’ contention that there should be no new trial and that this Court should order acquittals are as follows. The events in issue took place nearly three years ago. The sentences have been partly served. A new trial will add to the stresses which the appellants have already been subjected to. Most of the defects in the first trial arose for reasons other than the conduct of the appellants personally, and to the extent that it is not clear that all did, an assumption in favour of the appellants should be made. The existence of Mr McGinness’ evidence improves the prospect that a second trial could result in acquittals because the alternative Crown case is a weaker case than the higher Crown case. The character evidence which the appellants say they now wish to rely on may also have utility in the direction of achieving acquittals  
      
       
     24 The factors favourable to the Crown’s position are as follows. The crime is a serious one. Its prevalence is widespread. The first trial miscarried through technical mistakes. Though it lasted six days, it was not prolonged or complex. It cannot be said that the evidence adduced at the trial was insufficient to justify conviction by the trial judge if he had complied with the procedural requirements of the trial, if he had properly directed himself, and if he had properly expressed himself. The Crown is not seeking to cure evidential deficiencies by obtaining a second run with better evidence. While the Crown case rests on identification evidence, and while identification evidence requires very careful handling, in this case the type of evidence relied on has fewer infirmities than in other types of case because of the contemporaneity of the assault, the chase and the apprehensions. The Crown case cannot be said to be weak. That conclusion stands even if one does not take into account various inconsistencies within and between the evidence of the appellants. Even if Mr McGinness’ evidence is accepted at its highest, the second trial could well result in convictions not resting on any miscarriage of justice. And the Crown may consider that a rigorous testing of Mr McGinness’ evidence is called for. At all events, it is better that the force and significance of his evidence, together with any additional evidence which the appellants wish to call, be tested in a trial than used by this Court as a ground for depriving the Crown and the public of any satisfactory trial. There is no reason to suppose that the responsibility for the unsatisfactory nature of the first trial is to be laid at the door of the Crown any more than it is to be laid at the door of the appellants.  
      
       
     25 The following orders are proposed. 
      
       
       
       1. The appeal of Benjamin Ralph Blanchette is allowed and his convictions are quashed. 
        
        
       2. The appeal of Christian Joshua Blanchette is allowed and his convictions are quashed. 
        
        
       3. The appeal of the Crown is dismissed. 
        
        
       4. A new trial of Benjamin Ralph Blanchette and Christian Joshua Blanchette is ordered.

      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1    HIS HONOUR: On 30 April 2001 the prisoners Leonard James Masson and Shane Antoni Symss were arraigned before a jury on an indictment containing three charges namely murder, robbery with wounding and in company, and steal motor vehicle. The prisoner Masson pleaded not guilty to murder, but guilty to the other two charges. During the course of the trial he changed his plea to the second charge in the indictment to not guilty of robbery with wounding and in company but guilty of robbery in company. The Crown did not accept this plea and the jury were directed to ignore it during their deliberations. The prisoner Symss on arraignment pleaded not guilty to both murder and robbery with wounding and in company but guilty to larceny of a motor vehicle. 
     
      
    2    On 18 May 2001 the jury convicted Masson of manslaughter, robbery with wounding and in company and larceny and Symss of murder, robbery with wounding and in company and larceny. The prisoners are now to be sentenced for those offences. In addition both prisoners have asked me to take into account offences on a Form 1 under the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    3    It is important that I emphasise from the outset that, in accordance with the jury’s verdict, the prisoner Masson is to be sentenced for manslaughter and not murder. On the issues before the jury, such a verdict assigns to the prisoner a very limited role in the killing of the deceased. This is a very significant matter when it comes to determining Masson’s responsibility for the death of the deceased, and accordingly the appropriate punishment to reflect his culpability. The fact that the prisoner is to be sentenced for manslaughter and not murder must be reflected in a significantly lesser sentence than had he been convicted of murder as was Symss. 
     
      
    4    Further, as I shall endeavour to make clear, on the facts that the jury must have found proved, this is an unusual case of manslaughter arising from a death occurring during the course of a serious criminal offence of violence. The sentence which members of the community might believe should be inflicted upon a person involved in this truly appalling crime cannot be imposed upon Masson because of the very limited basis upon which the prisoner is to be sentenced. Unless regard is had to the very singular nature of the offence for which he was convicted, a misunderstanding and an erroneous appreciation of the sentence imposed upon him is likely to arise. 
     
      
    5    The facts arising from the jury’s verdicts are as follows. Mrs Florence Marino, the deceased, was a 75 year old widow who lived alone in her home in the suburbs of Wagga Wagga. Masson was also a resident of this city where he had lived initially with his parents and later with his wife before they separated. The deceased had been a close friend of Masson’s wife for a number of years and took a particular interest in his infant daughter. On occasions Masson had voluntarily performed odd jobs around her home, including mowing the lawns. 
     
      
    6    The prisoner Symss was a stranger to the area he having arrived a few weeks before the events giving rise to the offences. He had met Masson when the two found themselves residing in the same hostel in the city. They spent a considerable amount of time in each other’s company prior to Easter 1999. Masson is clearly the more intelligent of the two prisoners. He is also much bigger physically than Symss and would appear to be the stronger. However, as will become apparent, Mr Symss was a young man not unfamiliar with the criminal law and who was prepared to use violence when it suited him to do so. 
     
      
    7    On the morning of Saturday 24 April 1999 the deceased complained to a neighbour that she had heard noises during the night and in the morning had found her back gate open and a hole near the lock on the fly screen of her back door. The neighbour said that she would get her husband to look at the damaged flyscreen when he came home from work later that day. 
     
      
    8    At about 3.15 pm the neighbour’s husband went to Mrs Marino’s home with a pair of pliers to fix the flyscreen. He went to the back of the house and noticed that the back door was open. He called out but did not receive a reply. He entered the house and found the deceased’s body on the lounge room floor. The police and ambulance were summonsed and arrived a short time later. 
     
      
    9    There was blood on the deceased’s face and clothing and on the lounge and a cushion. Strands of long dark brown hair were located on or near the body. It was later ascertained that these hairs had come from the head of Symss. There was jewellery scattered around on the bedroom floor and a jewellery box was open on the dressing table. The deceased’s motor vehicle was missing. 
     
      
    10    The post-mortem examination of the deceased showed that death was consistent with her being smothered. There were superficial bruises and abrasions to the face and a patterned abrasion consistent with the deceased’s glasses being forced against her face. There were stretch lacerations on the right ear consistent with an earring being pulled from her ear. There were two stab wounds to her neck one a horizontal wound, and the other a very superficial incised wound. It was estimated that death had occurred between midday and 3 pm on 24 April. 
     
      
    11    At the time of the death of the deceased both prisoners were still residents at the hostel. However at some time during the evening of 24 April both prisoners left those premises. They travelled together to Broken Hill in the deceased’s motor vehicle, which they abandoned just outside the city. 
     
      
    12    The two prisoners then moved into accommodation provided for them by the Salvation Army at a hotel in Broken Hill. There they met a local resident, Tristan Robson, who took the prisoners to the home of a local drug supplier so that Symss could purchase some cannabis. During the evening Symss spoke to Robson about burning a motor vehicle in case police found hair in it from which they might carry out DNA testing. Robson asked him what was going on and Symss said “We knocked this cunt and took their car.” Robson said “What do you mean ‘knocked’, bashed or what?” Symss said, “No, they’re dead.” When they were alone for a short period Robson asked Masson if what Symss had said was true, and he replied, “I’ll talk to you later.” During that evening Symss asked Robson whether he could get rid of some jewellery, but Robson said he could not. 
     
      
    13    After finding the deceased’s motor vehicle, police began making inquiries at various hotels and motels in Broken Hill. The prisoners were located and arrested on 27 April. A search of the hotel room, which the prisoners had been occupying, located a number of items of the deceased’s jewellery in a sock in a bag belonging to Masson. 
     
      
    14    Each of the prisoners participated in a number of electronically recorded interviews with investigating police. Masson also took part in a video-recorded walk around at the scene of the killing. Both prisoners admitted that they had gone to the deceased’s house on 24 April so that Masson could ask the deceased for a loan of money. Each said that on the second occasion that they visited the premises that day, the other killed the deceased. Each maintained that he had no part in the killing. Both admitted that after the deceased was dead, they stole her handbag, items of her jewellery and her motor vehicle. 
     
      
    15    I shall deal firstly with the account given by Masson. His version was that on the second occasion they visited the deceased’s house, he asked to use the toilet and was admitted to the house by the deceased. When he was about to leave the premises, he turned to see Symss grab the deceased from behind and drag her into the lounge room. While Symss was holding the deceased around the mouth, he told the prisoner to look for money and threatened him when he hesitated to do so. The prisoner then went to the deceased’s bedroom and obtained her handbag. When he returned to the lounge room, he saw Symss with a pillow over the deceased’s face and Symss said that she was dead. Both he and Symss then took jewellery from the deceased’s bedroom before they left the premises. They then went to a hotel where they played pool and used the deceased’s money to purchase drinks for themselves and two young ladies whom they happened to meet. 
     
      
    16    Masson said that he was in fear of Symss by reason of what Symss had said about himself prior to the attack upon the deceased, the nature of that attack and a threat made to him while Symss was holding the deceased. He maintained that it was through fear of Symss that he assisted in carrying out the robbery and also helped in cleaning the lounge-room of blood. It was he who drove the deceased’s vehicle out of her garage. 
     
      
    17    It is clear that after the killing and up until his arrest in Broken Hill Masson had ample opportunity to bring to the notice of persons, whom he met, the fact that Symss had murdered the deceased. On one occasion he and Symss were given a lift by a police officer in a marked police vehicle yet the prisoner made no intimation to the officer of what Symss had done. However, Mr Robson gave evidence that it appeared to him that the prisoner was intimidated by Symss. Mr Robson also reports Symss making statements as to his criminal antecedents and associates similar to those that Masson said Symss told to him before the killing of the deceased. 
     
      
    18    A significant issue at the trial, as it was before me on sentencing, was the conduct of Masson during and after the attack by Symss upon the deceased. The Crown argued strongly before the jury that the prisoner’s conduct was explicable only on the basis that the killing of the deceased did not occur in the way Masson had described to the police; that is a result of a completely unexpected and horrifying act committed by Symss in which he played no part. Rather the Crown contended that the lack of any attempt by the prisoner to assist the deceased, to separate from Symss after the killing and his apparent lack of concern about what had occurred in the deceased’s home led to the only possible inference that he was involved in the killing. 
     
      
    19    Mr Molomby, on behalf of the prisoner, argued forcibly before the jury that they could not dismiss the possibility that the prisoner’s behaviour was a result of his fear of Symss and the effect of the trauma arising from the killing. He relied in particular upon parts of the prisoner’s interviews with police during which he appeared to become extremely distressed when recounting the attack upon the deceased by Symss. There were also occasions when, in what might be described as unguarded moments, the prisoner remonstrated with himself for being too cowardly to assist the deceased. 
     
      
    20    Initially I expressed in strong terms my scepticism of the prisoner’s explanation for his conduct both during and after the killing. The objective facts did not appear to me to be consistent with his account. As I have indicated, Masson was a very much physically larger and apparently stronger man than Symss. The attack occurred in a residential area on Saturday morning when people would be at hand to assist him had he simply fled through the front door and raised the alarm. Masson appears to have been in control of the proceeds of the robbery throughout until their arrest. He had himself committed dishonesty offences shortly before the robbery. In particular, I found it difficult to accept that the prisoner’s conduct at the hotel immediately after the killing of the deceased was consistent with his version of the killing. 
     
      
    21    Such was the importance of this matter and the likelihood that I would find against the prisoner on this issue, he having the onus of proving what was a mitigating factor, that an adjournment of the sentencing hearing was granted so that psychological evidence could be obtained which might support that version. I should indicate that the prisoner did not give evidence either at the trial or before me on sentence. 
     
      
    22    A psychological report, which was obtained during the adjournment, lent some support to the prisoner’s version, at least indirectly. It was the psychologist’s opinion that the prisoner’s behaviour was not only consistent with the effect of fear and trauma but also was inconsistent with a lack of anything to suggest that the prisoner had an anti-social personality which might otherwise account for what appeared to be extraordinary callousness on his part to the violent and horrific death of a harmless old woman whom the prisoner regarded as a friend. Both the psychologist in giving his opinion and Mr Molomby in his address on sentence relied heavily upon the fact that, up until a short time before the killing, the prisoner had shown strong social commitment and responsibility by, amongst other things, his voluntary community work. 
     
      
    23    At the end of the day, it seems to me that I should sentence the prisoner in accordance with his version, notwithstanding some lingering misgivings. As a matter of practical reality the jury must have accepted that his account to the police was possibly true. Had they found that any part of it to be false, then in my view they would have dismissed it all and convicted the prisoner of murder. This was because the Crown’s case was principally that the prisoner was actively involved in killing the deceased. In my opinion there was little prospect of the jury convicting of felony murder. The prisoner’s conduct during and after the killing was at the forefront of the Crown’s submission that the prisoner was a party to the suffocation of the deceased and the jury obviously rejected that argument, or were at least not persuaded of it to the appropriate degree. 
     
      
    24    I have briefly described the version given by the prisoner to police as to how the deceased met her death. In summary his account was that the attack upon her was completely unexpected by him. He stated that he was immediately appalled by what Symss had done, but that he felt, through concern for his own personal safety, that he was compelled to carry out Symss’ bidding to obtain the deceased’s money. 
     
      
    25    In effect the prisoner has maintained that from the moment he saw the deceased attacked by Symss he was in such fear for himself that he was unable to do anything else but go along with Symss both in carrying out the robbery and in accompanying him to Broken Hill. Although he had ample opportunity to separate from Symss or to contact the police and inform them of what Symss had done, he could not bring himself to do so both through fear of Symss and his associates and because he feared being arrested for his involvement in the robbery. 
     
      
    26    The verdict of manslaughter in my view is a finding by the jury that the prisoner did not actually foresee that Symss might suffocate the deceased, but that he contemplated that Symss would do some unlawful and dangerous act during the course of the robbery in which he became involved. The verdict of robbery in company with wounding is explicable on the basis that the prisoner admitted knowing that Symss had a knife when they returned to the deceased’s premises and that he had been led to believe by Symss himself that he was a person capable of violence. The jury must have been satisfied that he foresaw the possibility that in the robbery of the deceased Symss might use the knife to wound her. This finding is consistent with the evidence even if the jury disregarded, as I told them they should, that part of the prisoner’s second interview in which he describes some recollection of seeing Symss stab the deceased in the throat. 
     
      
    27    The prisoner Masson then is to be sentenced on the basis that he did not intend to rob the deceased when he went to her home on the second occasion, that he was not party to any joint enterprise to attack the deceased let alone kill her and that he became involved in the robbery when, having witnessed Symss’ attack upon her, he went to obtain her handbag. Further, he did what he did through fear of his own safety but knowing that Symss had a knife he foresaw the possibility that Symss would use it during the course of the robbery to wound the deceased. Although he did not foresee that Symss might suffocate the deceased, an act of suffocation was no more than an unexpected incident arising in the course of the robbery in which he was then participating. 
     
      
    28    I indicated at the outset of these remarks that the facts upon which the prisoner is to be sentenced consistent with the jury’s verdicts, give rise to an unusual case of manslaughter. He should be sentenced on the basis that his involvement in the robbery was on the spur of the moment after Symss had decided to commit the offence and that his participation was motivated through fear rather then personal gain. His responsibility for the death of the deceased arose in that he failed to render her assistance in circumstances where he foresaw at least that she might be stabbed during the attack upon her. 
     
      
    29    The prisoner is also to be sentenced for the matters on the form 1. While some portion of the sentence to be imposed upon the prisoner should be attributable to those matters, they are not in the category of seriousness of the offences for which the jury convicted him. However, one of the matters in particular must be given some weight. While on bail and in breach of his bail conditions the prisoner stole his parent’s vehicle and left their control to visit a girlfriend. This was notwithstanding that he had been released to bail after serving almost six months on remand. This conduct sits uneasily with the fact that persons have commented upon his fear and suffering while in custody. This behaviour shows the prisoner for what I believe him to be: self-centred and immature. It gives little confidence that the prisoner will reform until he addresses these fundamental defects in his personality. 
     
      
    30    The prisoner is aged 23 years and has no prior convictions. The evidence before me by way of testimonials and oral evidence suggests that before the spate of criminality, which culminated in the death of the deceased, the prisoner had been a worthwhile member of the community of Wagga Wagga. He was involved in community activities such as teaching swimming with a local club, coaching a water polo team, helping out at a local school and donating blood. I acknowledge that this conduct is inconsistent with my evaluation of him, but I believe that his willingness to assist others is subject to the proviso that it does not conflict with his own personal gratification. It is not insignificant that he used funds of one of these community organizations to fraudulently obtain money for himself in the period immediately before he committed the robbery upon the deceased. 
     
      
    31    The prisoner comes from a supportive and caring family. He fell out with his parents because of his behaviour in relation to a young lady and he left the family home at the age of 16 years. The prisoner and his parents have been reunited since his arrest and they are prepared to further support him. I should note publicly that his parents acted not only in the interests of the community but also in the interests of the prisoner himself by having his bail breached when he stole their vehicle and left their home. 
     
      
    32    I am prepared to find that the prisoner has been remorseful for the death of the deceased although that was not my original view. However, even if the prisoner has accepted moral culpability for her death as a result of his own cowardice, he has never acknowledged legal responsibility for what happened to her. The prisoner pleaded not guilty to murder and manslaughter, notwithstanding that, in my view, there was a strong case against him for manslaughter. I do not believe, contrary to submissions made on his behalf by Mr Molomby, that his conduct after arrest attracts any significant discount of his sentence. 
     
      
    33    Nor should the prisoner receive any benefit derived from the fact that on 9 July 1999 he made a statement indicating that he was prepared to testify against Symss. Section 23(2)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requires a court to have regard to the “significance and usefulness” of the offer of assistance. In my view the offer was of no use whatsoever, as the prisoner continued to deny his involvement in the death of the deceased. It was entirely appropriate for the Crown to reject the offer of assistance and to pursue the prisoner on the charge of murder. This is so notwithstanding that he was acquitted of that charge. I believe it would have been unlikely in the extreme that a jury would have found the prisoner to be a witness of truth. I do not believe the jury accepted his account in the present trial: the acquittal of murder simply indicates that they were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that his version was untrue. The assistance offered was not of significance because there was an overwhelming case against Symss based upon the evidence of the finding of his hair and his admissions. Nor, in my view, was the offer a genuine indication of remorse. The offer of assistance came with a request that the prisoner be transferred to the Special Purposes Prison at Long Bay because of fears he said that he then held because of the offer to give evidence against Symss. The prisoner could not have really believed that the offer would have been accepted and it was in my view given in the hope that the prisoner would gain what he believed to be a more advantageous placement in the prison system. 
     
      
    34    The psychological report tendered on sentence indicates what is apparent from hearing the prisoner in the recorded interviews with police: he is a highly intelligent and articulate young man. His IQ score was 122 and only 7 percent of the population would be expected to obtain a higher score. Testing showed no anti-social personality characteristics. The psychologist was of the view that the risk of re-offending was relatively low but that the prisoner may be assisted by guidance in respect of the misuse of alcohol and his gambling habit. For those reasons it seems to me that there are special circumstances in the present case. 
     
      
    35    I turn now to the sentencing of the prisoner Symss. He gave a version to police in which he attributed sole responsibility for the killing of the deceased to Masson. The version has few, if any, common features with that given by his co-offender. It is unnecessary, however, for me to take the time to set out in any detail his version of events because clearly the jury rejected it. By its verdicts the jury must have found that Symss was responsible for the actual killing of the deceased. I have no version before me, which is admissible against the prisoner, of how the deceased met her death at his hands. However, on the evidence I can infer that he suffocated her during the course of an armed robbery. Although Mr Hanley submitted that I should sentence him on the basis of felony murder, he accepted that it was more likely that the jury found him guilty on the basis of what I referred to in the summing up as intent murder. 
     
      
    36     I also suspect that Symss attempted to cut the deceased’s throat but for some reason was unable to succeed in that attempt whereupon he smothered her with a pillow. Mr Hanley argued strenuously that the finding that the prisoner performed this act was not open on the evidence, at least not to the criminal standard. However, I do not believe that I have to resolve that question. I do not consider that it has a significant bearing upon the assessment of the prisoner’s criminality or the sentence to be imposed upon him whether he attempted to cut the deceased’s throat before suffocating her, or whether he suffocated her after his co-offender tried to cut her throat. 
     
      
    37    I have no doubt that shortly after the two prisoners returned to the deceased’s house, Symss determined to rob her and, if necessary, that he would kill her in order to achieve that purpose. The prisoner admitted in his interviews with police, that shortly before the two arrived at the deceased’s home, he had been involved in attempts to obtain money illegally. Offences arising from these attempts are contained on the Form 1. I do not know when it was that he determined to carry out the robbery of the deceased, but it seems clear to me that he was becoming impatient as the attempts by Masson and him to obtain money failed. Once he determined to rob the deceased, the prisoner must have seen the killing as highly probable if not inevitable in the circumstances that the deceased was liable to raise the alarm and that she would be clearly able to identify Masson, if not the prisoner, as one of the persons responsible for stealing from her. 
     
      
    38    There can be no doubt that the prisoner suffocated the deceased intending to kill her. It was not suggested at the trial that whoever did the act that caused the death of the deceased did so with other than an intent to kill. There must have been a violent struggle resulting in the prisoner having some of his hair pulled out by the roots and the deceased suffering a rip to her ear. She must have been for some period however short, terrified and panic-stricken. Her actual death must have been horrible as she fought for air. All this inflicted by the prisoner upon a harmless and elderly woman in her own home for the sake of a paltry sum of money and valuables of little worth. He could not have expected the spoils to be any greater than they were. 
     
      
    39    The killing was a particularly callous one, not only in the actual infliction of death. As I have already indicated the prisoner Symss, almost immediately after this dreadful act of brutality, went to a hotel where he used some of the deceased’s money amusing himself with his co-offender playing pool, drinking alcohol and socialising with some young ladies they met there. A short time later the two made their way to Broken Hill in the deceased’s motor vehicle. Throughout this trip Symss appeared to be self-assured, cocky and untroubled by what he had done. 
     
      
    40    To say that Symss has shown no remorse for the murder of the deceased is an understatement. His remarks to Mr Robson, even though made while under the influence of alcohol and cannabis, suggest that he was proud of what he had done. He certainly used the fact that he had killed someone to enhance the persona that he wished to display to Mr Robson. He was keen to present himself as a person to be feared both by reason of his own deeds and his association with violent persons. 
     
      
    41    Nor did he show the slightest remorse after his arrest. Initially he refused to be interviewed by the police but only did so when he learned that Masson was blaming him for the killing. He then took the opportunity to return the favour by manufacturing a version implicating Masson and exculpating himself. As I have indicated, the jury found that this version was untrue. The prisoner is not to be punished for this behaviour but it is significant when consideration is given to his rehabilitation that he has shown not one scrap of remorse either by his conduct or his statements after the killing. 
     
      
    42    It is obviously a murder coming within the upper range of seriousness. It can truly be described as a wicked crime, having regard to the objective factors surrounding the killing. It was callous and cowardly. It attracts all the attributes of sentencing that demand a heavy sentence be imposed: general and specific deterrence, denunciation, retribution, and vindication for the loss of the life of a member of the community. 
     
      
    43    The prisoner is aged 24 years. He has a criminal record dating back to 1991 when he was convicted of assault in the Children’s Court in Beenleigh, Queensland. He was dealt with for offences relating to the breaking and entry of houses in February and August 1992. In September 1995 he was sentenced in the Brisbane District Court for a number of offences of breaking and entering houses and, more relevantly, of armed robbery in company and armed robbery with personal violence. He was placed on probation for 3 years. In November 1996 he was sentenced to community service for the unlawful use of a motor vehicle. In 1997, after breaching his probation order, he received a suspended sentence of 3 years in respect of the offences for which he was place on probation in 1995. In September 1998 he was sentenced in Bendigo Magistrates Court for burglary and theft to 4 months imprisonment to be served by way of an Intensive Corrections Order. 
     
      
    44    The facts in relation to the armed robbery offences for which the prisoner was sentenced in Queensland were placed before me. They indicate that the prisoner was in 1993 involved in a number of serious armed robbery offences, and on occasions placed a knife at the throat of his victim. This conduct is not insignificant when considering the facts of the present matter. This record indicates that the present offences, apart from the fact that his victim was murdered, were not an aberration. It is an aggravating feature that he was on the suspended sentence from Queensland at the time. There must also be an element of specific deterrence involved in the sentence. 
     
      
    45    Since the prisoner has been in custody on remand he has been placed in protection. Apparently this is a result of the fact that Masson had told others that he sexually assaulted the deceased although there is not the slightest evidence that he did so. The prisoner has been assaulted on at least one occasion. The murder was itself of such a nature that the prisoner would always have been at risk especially having regard to his slight physique. 
     
      
    46    There is little doubt that the prisoner had a disturbed upbringing even though there is some conflict in the accounts he has given of it. But when it comes to sentencing for an offence of the seriousness with which I am concerned there is little room for mitigation or sympathy to play a role. However, I am conscious that there are a number of persons in the community who apparently think highly of him and find the murder of the deceased hard to reconcile with their view of his character. This evidence may at least indicate that he is not unredeemable notwithstanding all the contra-indications that exist while he refuses to accept or show contrition for what he has done. 
     
      
    47    The prisoner accepts that he was an alcoholic prior to the commission of the murder. He has not undertaken any attempts at rehabilitation or detoxification before going into custody. He has also been a constant user of cannabis. But neither of these matters seems to have any relevance to the present offence other than his need for money to satisfy these addictions. He was not affected by alcohol or drugs when the offence was committed. At the time of the offence the prisoner was involved in seasonal work as a fruit picker and for that reason was travelling around the state. He has family in Queensland who have contacted him since his arrest. 
     
      
    48    As I have already indicated the prisoner’s incarceration so far has been difficult. There was a suicide attempt shortly after he was convicted. There is some suggestion that he may have an anti-social personality disorder although this has not been fully explored. Dr Westmore was unable at this stage to give any prognosis for the prisoner. Dr Perica who most recently examined the prisoner could find no evidence to support a psychopathy. The prisoner has been showing an interest in furthering his education while in custody and has a particular interest in architecture. 
     
      
    49    There are no special circumstances in the present case. It is clear that the prisoner will need a lengthy period on parole but that will be achieved simply by the application of the prescribed proportion between the non-parole period and the total sentence found in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Nor is there any reason for the non-parole period to be reduced. I have taken into account generally that the prisoner will need to spend a substantial period of his custody in protection. 
     
      
    50    Finally, I note that I have received in evidence victim impact statements written by the deceased’s daughter and her son and his family. That material was not admitted for the purpose of increasing the sentences of the prisoners and has not been used by me in any way to aggravate the severity of their crimes. But the reception of such evidence permits the family of the deceased to participate in the proceedings by expressing their grief and loss as a result of the death of their loved one. It reminds the court, if it is necessary to do so, of the real human tragedy involved in matters that come before it. I understand that it is particularly difficult to accept the death of a family member when it occurs so needlessly and in circumstances of brutality as occurred in this case. The court expresses it’s sympathy and understanding to them. 
     
      
    51    The prisoner Symss is sentenced in respect of the offence of murder and taking into account the matters on the Form 1 to 22 years imprisonment to date from 27 April 1999. There is to be a non-parole period of 16 1/2 years to expire on 26 October 2015 the date upon which the prisoner is eligible to be released to parole. In respect of the robbery with wounding and in company he is sentenced to a fixed term of 5 years to commence on 27 April 1999 and expire on 26 April 2004. In respect of the larceny he is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 2 years to date from 27 April 1999 and expired on 26 April 2001. I have chosen fixed terms in respect of these latter two sentences because of the sentence on the count of murder. 
     
      
    52    The prisoner Masson is sentenced in respect of the offence of manslaughter and taking into account the matters on the Form 1 to imprisonment for 7½ years to date from 15 March 2000. This allows the prisoner about 6 months of custody before he was released to bail. There is to be a non-parole period of 4½ years to date from 15 March 2000 and to expire on 14 September 2004 the date he is eligible to be released to parole. In respect of the robbery in company and wounding he is sentenced to 3½ years fixed term to commence on 15 March 2000 and to expire on 14 September 2003. In respect of the larceny he is sentenced to a fixed term of 18 months from 15 March 2000 and which expired on 14 September 2001. I have chosen fixed terms in respect of these latter two sentences because of the sentence on the count of manslaughter.

    70018/01 - REGINA v John Raymond MUNCE 
     
      
    Judgment: Voir Dire on admissibility of Record of Interview. 
     
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The accused, John Raymond Munce, has been charged with the murder of Leslie Forrest. Mr Forrest died on 21 January 1971, after he fell down the steps of a companionway leading from the deck at the level of the recreation room to the deck at the level of the mess room on the merchant ship “Ngahere”. The ship was berthed in Newcastle harbour. 
     
      
    2 Following a coronial inquiry, a finding of accidental death was brought in by the Coroner. 
     
      
    3 The “Ngahere” was a New Zealand vessel and many of its crew lived in New Zealand. The accused was a young seaman on the “Ngahere” at the time and continued as a seaman for some years after the incident. He has not been to sea for many years. 
     
      
    4 On 11 November 1999 the accused contacted police in Auckland and in a formal interview, by way of ERISP, admitted that he had kicked Forrest deliberately causing him to fall down the steps, where he died. However, he also made other statements and the ERISP contains both admissions from the accused that he caused or contributed to Forrest’s fall as well as statements which contradict those admissions. 
     
      
    5 The Crown has now indicated that during the course of the trial it proposes to tender the ERISP conducted at the Auckland Central police station. Apart from some evidence of Mr Bidgood, who was a seaman on the ship, and a psychiatrist, Dr O’Dea, the ERISP will constitute the Crown case. 
     
      
    6 Mr Bidgood did not see the incident, but gave evidence of an earlier incident, which may provide a motive for the accused to have harmed the deceased. Dr O’Dea examined the accused and also considered the ERISP. 
     
      
    7 The admissibility of the ERISP has been considered on a voir dire examination. Because of the indication from defence counsel of the grounds of the objection, said to be sections 85, 90, 135(b) and (c) and 137 of the Evidence Act, but mindful of the remarks of Hunt CJ at CL in Charajit Singh-Bal (1997) 92 A Crim R, I allowed the voir dire to occur. 
     
      
    8 I have viewed the ERISP and heard evidence from Dr O’Dea. A report from Dr O’Dea and another forensic psychiatrist, Dr Bruce Westmore, retained by the accused, have been tendered. 
     
      
    9 It is plain that the accused has had, for many years, very serious health problems. He is now aged forty-seven and is unemployed. His father, who died approximately ten years ago was a heavy drinker, coming home drunk most days at 6 pm. His mother had difficulty with the stresses imposed and became intolerant and would “yell and scream and give verbal and physical abuse.” His parents divorced and his mother turned to a religious faith. 
     
      
    10 The accused was a poorly behaved child and left school early to join the merchant navy at age fourteen, where he remained for ten years. After that he worked in Auckland in various capacities. He appears to have had at least two long term but difficult de facto relationships. 
     
      
    11 The accused has a long history of alcohol and drug abuse and dependence from his teenage years. On board ship he drank a carton of beer and a bottle of vodka on many days. He drank heavily after leaving the merchant navy, consuming alcohol continuously every day. He often drank methylated spirits in the morning to help him with his “shakes”. He reported to Dr O’Dea that he had flashbacks and nightmares about the alleged offence and often drank to be rid of these symptoms.  
     
      
    12 The accused has undergone a number of treatments for his alcohol abuse. He has also regularly smoked cannabis since about age fifteen and for ten years since the night of the alleged offence, had regularly used LSD. He has also experimented with heroin, amphetamines, opium and cocaine. 
     
      
    13 The accused reported to Dr O’Dea that he began having stressful psychiatric symptoms about two or three months after the alleged offence. He said that he started to get “intrusive “flashbacks” and “nightmares” when asleep.” He reported pictures in his mind of the deceased “lying at the bottom of the stairs with his brains hanging out and lots of blood around while I was standing at the top of the stairs looking down.” 
     
      
    14 Dr O’Dea reported: 
     
      
       
        
        “He said that the ‘nightmares’ were dreams he had in his sleep of the deceased whereby images of the deceased would ‘change into a snake charmer or pied piper with rats’. He said ‘[the deceased] became a martyr, a person who dominated my dreams’. He also said that the deceased ‘used to come and see me and I would think he was there … I thought he had come to visit me at [The Anchor Hostel in Newcastle in June 2001]’. He told me that he had also occasionally had ‘nightmares’ regarding the alleged physical abuse he had endured as a child and alleged sexual abuse he had experienced onboard the merchant navy ships.” 
        
       
      
    15 The accused has previously been diagnosed as alcohol dependent with depression and personality problems. Treatment has been attempted for these problems including a treatment of Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing for his “flashbacks.” His problems have continued, although they have been alleviated by a significant medication regime. 
     
      
    16 Dr O’Dea reports that the accused’s “flashbacks” began to occur two to three months after the death of Forrest. The accused told him that he “only began to imagine he had killed the deceased after experiencing the “flashbacks” and “nightmares”. On the day of the incident the accused said he drank and took one “trip” of LSD. The accused told Dr O’Dea that he did not remember pushing the deceased down the stairs, but he did remember him “lying at the bottom of the stairs with people standing around him.” 
     
      
    17 Again, he told Dr O’Dea: 
     
      
       
        
        “… that although he had worried for many years (as a result of the ‘flashbacks’ and ‘nightmares’) that he may have killed the deceased, he first confessed this belief to a fellow resident at Odyssey House in November 1999. He said that at the time he was on probation following conviction for DUI and Dangerous Driving. He said that he shared his story with the fellow resident who was telling him of his ‘nightmares’ and ‘flashbacks’ in relation to his experiences as a soldier in Northern Ireland. He said that the fellow resident disclosed their discussion to a staff member. Mr Munce told me that he thought that the staff member would tell the police. 
        
       
       
        
        He said that he left the program and that after a binge on alcohol, methylated spirits and cannabis for about 1 week, he contacted the police to ‘confess to the murder’. I note his repeated reference to his feelings of guilt in relation to the death. He said that he attempted suicide by overdose of sleeping tablets on the night after the ‘confession’. 
        
       
       
        
        He told me that with further psychiatric treatment since the ‘confession’ he had used less alcohol and other drugs and the intrusive ‘flashbacks’ and ‘nightmares’ had subsided. He told me that as a result of this he now did not believe that he pushed the deceased down the stairs.” 
        
       
      
    18 Dr O’Dea expressed the following opinion: 
     
      
       
        
        “The ‘flashbacks’ and ‘nightmares’ Mr Munce has reported in relation to the alleged offences could be understood in a variety of ways. They may represent an accurate recollection of the events of the alleged offence. However, they may also represent a revised account of the alleged offence shaped by time and Mr Munce’s substance use at the time of the alleged offence and subsequently. They may also represent a revised account of the alleged offence shaped by time and his emotional state at the time of the alleged offence and subsequently. They may also represent a revised account of the alleged offence shaped by time and his reaction to accounts of the alleged offence by others. The ‘flashbacks’ and ‘nightmares’ may also be a symptom of his apparently chronic depression and relate to this sense of guilt in general and in relation to the deceased. 
        
       
       
        
        It is speculative and difficult to identify which of the above approaches best helps with an understanding of the ‘flashbacks’ and ‘nightmares’ and it may be that they are a result of a combination of these possibilities. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Munce appeared to have based his ‘confession’ more on the ‘flashbacks’ and ‘nightmares’ that began some months after the night of the alleged offence rather than on a clear recollection of events of the night of the alleged offence. His ‘confession’ appeared to have occurred at a time when he was having problems in his alcohol and other drug rehabilitation program including a 1 week ‘binge’ on alcohol and other drugs and ongoing problems with depression. His account of the alleged offence appeared vague and inconsistent with the account of witnesses giving evidence at the time of the death. In addition Mr Munce has significantly changed his view about the ‘confession’ and did not believe, at the time of our interviews, that he had in fact committed the alleged offence. 
        
       
       
        
        With this in mind I am not able to be confident of the reliability and accuracy of Mr Munce’s accounts of events in relation to the alleged offence. In the absence of corroborative evidence it would be difficult to be sure of the historical accuracy of Mr Munce’s accounts of the alleged offence.” 
        
       
      
    19 Dr O’Dea drew attention, in his oral evidence, to the inconsistencies in the accused’s memory of the events when reported at various times. An examination of the ERISP also reveals inconsistencies both as to the events which he recalls and the motivation for his actions. Dr O’Dea reports that before the interview the accused had drunk significant quantities of beer, had three joints of cannabis and taken Prozac. However, the officer conducting the interview says that he did not identify the accused as being under the influence of alcohol or any other drug. 
     
      
    20 The views of Dr O’Dea are generally shared by Dr Westmore, who concluded by saying this: 
     
      
       
        
        “This case differs from many other cases involving false confessions. In those cases an individual will make a false confession knowing or believing at the time they make the false confession that they are in fact not guilty of the offence to which they have confessed. This is certainly true for individuals not suffering overt mental illness such as psychotic disorders who make false confessions. In this particular case the history would suggest that this man may have genuinely held a belief about an event, that belief being untrue and to which he has subsequently, truthfully, that is to the best of his ability, confessed to. I do have concerns about the reliability of the record of interview; not about its truthfulness, but its accuracy.” 
        
       
      
    21 As I indicated, counsel for the defence objects to the tender of the ERISP, having regard to a number of provisions of the Evidence Act. I shall consider each ground of the objection separately. 
     
      
       
      Section 85 
      
    22 Section 85 provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “85 (1) This section applies only in a criminal proceeding and only to evidence of an admission made by a defendant: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) in the course of official questioning, or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) as a result of an act of another person who is capable of influencing the decision whether a prosecution of the defendant should be brought or should be continued. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Evidence of the admission is not admissible unless the circumstances in which the admission was made were such as to make it unlikely that the truth of the admission was adversely affected. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account for the purposes of subsection (2), it is to take into account: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) any relevant condition or characteristic of the person who made the admission, including age, personality and education and any mental, intellectual or physical disability to which the person is or appears to be subject, and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) if the admission was made in response to questioning: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) the nature of the questions and the manner in which they were put, and  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) the nature of any threat, promise or other inducement made to the person questioned.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    23 It is plain that the ERISP was obtained in the course of official questioning. Accordingly, as the proceedings are of a criminal nature and the relevant evidence an admission s 85 must be considered. Subsection (2) provides that the evidence cannot be admitted unless the circumstances make it unlikely that the truth of the admission was adversely affected. Subsection (3) invites consideration of any condition or characteristic of the person who makes the admission including personality, mental or intellectual disability. The court must also have regard to the nature of the questions and the manner in which they were put during the interview. 
     
      
    24 Counsel for the accused points to the fact that the accused is suffering from the effects of alcohol and substance abuse which, in the opinion of the two psychiatrists, make his admission unreliable. It is submitted that, together with the apparent inconsistencies in the ERISP which would suggest that it could not be accepted, I should decline to admit it because these factors make it likely that the truth of the admission has been affected by the personality and psychiatric problems of the accused and, accordingly, the Crown has not discharged the onus which it carries having regard to s 85(2). 
     
      
    25 Section 85(2) was authoritatively considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Rooke, unreported, CCANSW, 2 September 1997 where Barr J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I think that the expression ‘the circumstances in which the admission was made’ as used as in subs (2) is intended to mean the circumstances of and surrounding the making of the admissions, not the general circumstances of the events said to form part of the offence to which the admissions are relevant. That is because, first, it is the lain meaning of the words. Secondly, it follows because subs (1) intends the section to have effect only where there is official questioning (or an act of the kind relevant under para (1)(b)). So far as the present appeal is concerned, the section may be said to be intended to require courts to inquire, where appropriate, into the process by which official questioning produces evidence tendered at trial. If the circumstances of the official questioning are such as to produce untruthful or unreliable evidence of admissions - adversely to affect their truth - the evidence is inadmissible. But the section is only concerned with the truth or reliability of evidence of admissions in this limited way. It has generally no part to play in the admissibility of evidence of admissions which may be untrue or unreliable for other reasons. Untruthfulness or unreliability in those circumstances is not a question for the trial judge at all, but for the jury.” 
         
        
       
      
    26 I acknowledge the discussion by Odgers in the informative text, Uniform Evidence Law, 4th ed, p 199 ff, but must, of course, apply the decision in Rooke in this case. I do so mindful also of the decision of Hidden J in R v Braun, unreported, SCNSW, 24 October 1997 and Higgins J in R v Taylor, [1999] ACTSC 47, 26 May 1999. 
     
      
    27 In the present case the accused’s questioning arose from his voluntary presentation at the Auckland police station where he agreed to a formal interview. There is no suggestion that that interview was other than scrupulously fair. Although the accused had consumed significant alcohol and cannabis during the course of the day, it is not suggested that he was intoxicated or unable to understand and respond to the questions he was asked. No doubt his long-term abuse of both substances gave him a tolerance beyond that of an ordinary person. 
     
      
    28 Although, by reason of his undoubted psychiatric problems there may be real doubt as to whether the accused was giving an accurate account of the events, there is nothing arising from the objective circumstances of the interview which would impact upon the truth of the admission. 
     
      
    29 In my opinion s 85 does not allow me to reject the ERISP. Whether the admissions should be accepted is a matter for the jury. 
     
      
       
      Section 90 
      
    30 Section 90 is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “90. In a criminal proceeding, the court may refuse to admit evidence of an admission, or refuse to admit the evidence to prove a particular fact, if: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) the evidence is adduced by the prosecution, and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to a defendant to use the evidence.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    31 The section is concerned with the circumstances “in which the admission was made.” In the present case as I have indicated, although those circumstances were unusual, the questioning process was voluntarily undertaken by the accused and in my judgment was scrupulously fair. My only concern about the process arises from the accused’s ingestion of alcohol and other drugs on the day in question. However, I accept the evidence of Det King that the accused appeared unaffected and observation of the ERISP itself raises no concern in this respect. 
     
      
    32 The Crown submitted that if I came to the view that the evidence was unreliable, I could reject it for this reason alone, having regard to the decision of the High Court in R v Swaffield, and Pavic v The Queen (1998) 192 CLR 159. 
     
      
    33 The accused submitted that, having regard to the mental instability which has been identified by the doctors and the real possibility that the accused has fabricated the events in his own mind, I should conclude that the admissions are unreliable and it would be relevantly unfair to allow them into evidence. 
     
      
    34 I do not share the view inherent in the submissions of both the Crown and the accused. Swaffield and Pavic were concerned with the circumstances where the process of eliciting the admission brought about an unfairness. That is not the position here.  
     
      
    35 Although a circumstance may arise where evidence is so unreliable that no account should be taken of it, neither mental illness nor intoxication dictate its exclusion. (see Sinclair v The King, [1946] 73 CLR 316). It remains for the jury, appropriately instructed, to determine the weight, if any, which should be given to the admissions.  
     
      
    36 In the present case, although I have considerable reservations about whether the admission alone could be the basis for a conviction, I cannot conclude that it is so unreliable that no weight could be given to it. 
     
      
    37 For these reasons, I cannot conclude that it would be unfair, in the relevant sense, to allow the ERISP into evidence. 
     
      
       
      Section 135 
      
    38 Section 135 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “135. The court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might: 
        
       
       
        
         (a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party, or 
         
         (b) be misleading or confusing, or 
         
         (c) cause or result in undue waste of time.” 
        
       
      
    39 Reliance was placed by counsel for the accused on s 135(b) and (c). The submission with respect to (c) cannot be sustained. Whatever the time which may be consumed by the trial and whether or not an acquittal is inevitable, are not relevant considerations. The evidence is clearly relevant to the fundamental issue which must be determined in the proceedings. 
     
      
    40 I have already indicated that, in my opinion, the evidence contained in the ERISP is burdened by internal inconsistencies and the medical evidence as to the acused’s psychiatric condition. Mindful of the discussion in Odgers about the meaning to be attributed to the term “probative value” for my part I would adopt the view suggested by McHugh J in Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297: 
     
      
       
        
        “Probative value is defined in the Dictionary of the Act as being ‘the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue.’ That assessment, of course, would necessarily involve considerations of reliability. ‘Probative value’ is an important consideration in the exercise of the powers conferred by ss 135 and 137.” 
        
       
      
    41 Adopting that approach to the problem I have little hesitation in concluding that the ERISP has some, but little, probative value. However, I do not believe it has any capacity to mislead or confuse. Once instructed no doubt the jury will give the ERISP the weight which it believes it deserves. 
     
      
       
      Section 137 
      
    42 This section provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “137. In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.” 
        
       
      
    43 Having regard to my conclusion with respect to s 90 it will be apparent that I do not believe an objection under this section can be sustained. Although I am of the view that the ERISP has little probative value, once any question of its tendency to prove the alleged guilt of the accused is set aside (Papakosmas para 91, 98) no relevant prejudice can be identified. 
     
      
    44 It will be apparent that I have identified in these reasons the considerable difficulties in the Crown case if it depends (as I understand to be the position) almost entirely on the admission made by the accused in the ERISP. However, the weight to be given to the ERISP is a matter for the jury. There is no basis upon which I can exclude it from evidence.

      R v Phuong Canh NGO 
       
       
      Remarks on Sentence 
      
    1 His Honour: On 29 June last, the Jury found the prisoner, Phuong Canh Ngo, guilty of the murder of the late John Newman MP who was shot outside his home at 15 Woods Avenue, Cabramatta on 5 September 1994. The shots were fired by a person who came to the scene by car and was driven away at speed immediately after the shooting, and the Jury's verdict established that the killing was instigated and organised by the prisoner.2 The Crown case depended to a large extent on the evidence of two alleged accomplices who had been granted immunity from prosecution. Their names have been suppressed and I shall refer to them simply as W1 and W2. They each gave evidence of previous attempts on the deceased’s life instigated by the prisoner, and although W1 said that he was not involved after about May 1994, W2 gave evidence that he was in the motor vehicle which carried the shooter to and from the scene of the shooting on the night of the murder, although he claimed he was tricked into being there by a switch of mobile phones in the office of the Mekong Club. He identified the persons whom he said were the shooter and driver and claimed that, although in the car, he did not know why he was there, and in particular did not know that the shooting was to take place. 3 The Defence challenged W2's version of what occurred on the evening of 5 September and in particular his evidence of the so-called switch of the mobile phones, his claim that he was tricked into being at the murder scene unaware of what was about to happen and his identification of the other two accused as the shooter and driver respectively. Parts of his evidence were unconvincing; and the acquittal of the other two accused tried with the prisoner, the alleged shooter and the alleged driver, showed that the Jury was not prepared to accept the evidence of W2 on these matters beyond reasonable doubt.4 These considerations, however, were not applicable to the case against the prisoner because there was undisputed evidence against him of events on the night of the murder which did not depend on the evidence of W2 but were established by the evidence of the telephone calls from the car phone in the Camry motor vehicle which I am satisfied was being used by the prisoner, the tracing of the movements of such vehicle by reference to those telephone calls, the evidence of Shirley Barrett who recognised the prisoner’s voice in two of the calls, in one of which he identified himself, and the finding of the murder weapon at Voyager Point, a location consistent with the movements of the vehicle. 5 Moreover, irrespective of W2’s evidence concerning the switch of the mobile phones, what is significant in relation to such phones is that the Telstra records show that calls made to or from each of them, that is the Fairfield Council mobile, the Mekong Club mobile and the Camry car phone (all of which were under the control and disposition of the prisoner) between 8.58 pm and 9.31 pm (2 minutes after the shooting) are consistent with them all being either in the vicinity of John Newman's home or on the route described by witnesses as that taken by the getaway car immediately after the shooting. There was also other evidence against him including evidence pointing to his part in the prior planning and attempts, inconsistent and untruthful answers given by him to police when interviewed, and I am satisfied that he had a motive to kill John Newman.6 W1 and W2 who were employees of the Mekong Club, of which the prisoner was the founder and Honorary President, gave evidence that between March and the end of April 1994 the prisoner enlisted their aid in the purchase of guns, and he also asked W2 to find a person who was prepared to kill John Newman for money. W2 enlisted the aid of an intermediary, but the intermediary was unable to find someone who was prepared to do the job having regard to the high profile of the intended victim.7 After a .22 rifle had been purchased at Botany and a .32 Beretta pistol, which ultimately became the murder weapon, had been purchased and taken to the Mekong Club where it was shown by W2 to Robert Zervos, the manager, three so-called attempts were made to kill John Newman; firstly, outside the Thien Hong Restaurant at Cabramatta, secondly, at the Greyhound Club at Yagoona and thirdly, at Newman's house. All of these attempts failed because the two would-be assassins, W1 and W2, were either incompetent, or could not bring themselves to actually carry out the crime. They each suggested that they expected the other one to fire the first shot and that they were only there as “back up”, but the net result was that no shots were fired and no attempt was made. They also gave evidence of a couple of other so-called plans to kill John Newman devised by the prisoner during this time, which can only be described as “hare-brained”, one a proposal to shoot him at his office and another one to shoot him at Fairfield Council Chambers when he was attending a meeting, a place where it seems he rarely attended meetings in 1994.8 There was no corroboration of the accomplices in relation to these earlier attempts on John Newman's life, but there was substantial corroboration in respect of the purchase of the guns and the attempt to find an assassin through the intermediary, including the evidence of Tong Ngoc who said that W2 told him at the time that the Beretta was for the prisoner who wanted it to kill John Newman. W1 and W2 each tended to minimise his own role as against that of the other, (as accomplices are wont to), but I can see no reason for them giving evidence of criminal activities by themselves if such events never took place, and their evidence, although differing in detail, contained so many points of commonality that I am satisfied that the so-called attempts must have taken place and at the instigation and direction of the prisoner. After the third of these attempts W1 withdrew from the enterprise and left the Mekong Club, although he later rejoined.9 At some stage, which it seems to me was probably after W1’s withdrawal from the enterprise, W2 on the instruction of the prisoner made an approach to a person who gave evidence under the pseudonym of Robert Morris and through him acquired a Ruger semi-automatic pistol, and Morris also made arrangements with another man for him to kill Newman. However, the other man apparently also got cold feet and the Ruger was reported missing. In respect of this incident, the evidence of W2 was substantially corroborated by Morris. After the loss of the Ruger, a .45 Magnum was acquired, again through the offices of Morris, and the evidence relating to this was corroborated by Morris and by the person through whom Morris acquired the gun; and following that, again through Morris, an approach was made to have a silencer fitted to the Beretta.10 W1 gave evidence that after he returned to the Club, the prisoner asked him on two occasions for the loan of his car (although the prisoner had virtually exclusive use of the white Camry owned by the club) and on one of these occasions told him that he wanted the car to kill John Newman. W1 refused, expressing a fear that if he lent the car to the prisoner for this purpose and Newman was killed his number plate might be identified.11 On the evening of Saturday 3 September 1994 at about 9.45 pm two witnesses saw a person whom they recognised as the prisoner standing beside a white car in Judith Avenue, a street to the rear of John Newman’s house, and then or shortly afterwards members of another family nearby saw another car parked in a position from where the front entrance of his house could be observed. The Crown suggested the prisoner and whoever was in the other vehicle were engaged in surveillance of Newman’s house and this may well be so, although another possibility is that they were there to kill him that night and their plans were thwarted because he was delayed at a political fundraising function at the Serbian Club, and did not arrive home until after 11.30 pm.12 On Monday 5 September 1994, a general staff meeting was held at the Mekong Club. The minutes record that the meeting finished at 8.45 pm but a number of witnesses gave evidence that it finished earlier, and I am satisfied that it did finish earlier, probably at about 8.15 pm. Then at about 8.30 pm the prisoner and others left the Club. W2 claimed he did not leave with them but left a short time later after the Mekong Club mobile phone and the Fairfield Council mobile phone in the Manager's office had been switched in a manner which tricked him into being at the murder scene.13 The deceased arrived home from a Labor Party branch meeting just before 9.30 pm and drove into his carport. His fiancée Lucy Wang heard his car coming, went out to greet him and they were together putting a tarpaulin over the car when a gunman got out of a vehicle and fired four shots at the deceased with the Beretta at point blank range, two of the shots entering his chest causing fatal injuries. The gunman then got back into the car which left the scene quickly without any headlights on via Warwick Avenue, Towers Street and Cabramatta Road whilst the prisoner travelled past Newman's home in the opposite direction in the white Camry, turned left into Bowden Street and then left onto Cabramatta Road. I am satisfied that both vehicles then travelled west on Cabramatta Road until they reached a service station on the corner of Townsend Road where the gun was transferred to the prisoner.14 He possibly went briefly to his home in Bonnyrigg and then certainly drove to and through the Liverpool CBD and down Heathcote Road to Voyager Point, then a remote, sparsely populated area, where he threw the gun off a footbridge into the Georges River, whence it was recovered some 3 years, 9 months later and subsequently identified as the murder weapon. He then returned to the Mekong Club via Chipping Norton where he delivered some material to the letterbox of the editor of a Vietnamese newspaper. He was back at the club in time to watch the news on television at 10.30 pm where the death of John Newman was reported.15 I am satisfied to the criminal standard that Phuong Ngo's motive for the killing of John Newman was naked political ambition and impatience. He wanted to be the Legislative Assembly member for Cabramatta, but had given the Labor Party hierarchy an undertaking that he would not run for pre-selection whilst John Newman was the sitting member. He could not wait until the next general election due in 1999; and so he needed to remove John Newman as the sitting member in order that he could run in the pre-selection ballot which, on the numbers, he had a very good chance of winning. The method he chose was to have John Newman killed.16 Both in the trial and on sentence, it was submitted that his political ambition was a seat in the Legislative Council rather than the Assembly as that would give him influence state wide rather than merely in the Cabramatta area, and it had been indicated to him that he would be favourably considered for such a seat, even as late as at his lunch with John Della Bosca (then State Secretary of the Labor Party) on the day of the murder, and that the motive for the murder may have been no more than personal animosity arising from mud slinging at the prisoner by the deceased. 17 I reject that submission for a number of reasons. The prisoner had already shown his desire for the Assembly seat by running for it as an independent (before joining the Labor Party), he was a Councillor and Deputy Mayor of Fairfield City Council which largely encompassed the Cabramatta electorate, and his power base was in Cabramatta (with its large Vietnamese and other Asian population). 18 Moreover, in statements made by him after the death of John Newman, particularly in his interview with Michael Cameron, political journalist with the Daily Telegraph, on the day following, in his first interview with police on 14 September and in his joint press conference with Nick Lalich on 15 September 1994, he indicated that he wished to replace John Newman if the pre-selection was held locally, and the evidence establishes that, mainly through building up the Canley Heights branch, he had sufficient support in a local rank and file ballot to obtain the pre-selection. There was also the evidence of another witness that some months prior to the killing the prisoner told her that he wanted to go into Parliament and be leader of the area, and the only thing that stood in his way was John Newman.19 Reference was made to a rule in the Labor Party to the effect that candidates for pre-selection had to have two years’ continuous membership of the Party before being eligible to contest a pre-selection ballot, but there was sufficient evidence in the trial to satisfy me that this rule could be waived, and I have no doubt that the prisoner was confident that he could get it waived.20 If he had wanted a seat in the Council and was confident of getting it, there was no reason to proceed with the murder, as I am satisfied, as was the Jury, that he did. Even if it was a Council seat he was seeking, the evidence was that he needed the support of the sitting Assembly member to obtain a winnable place on the “ticket”, and whilst John Newman was the member, he did not have that support.21 Phuong Ngo's defence, unsupported by any evidence from him, was that not only did he have nothing to do with the killing of John Newman on 5 September 1994 but that, whilst the other activities of W1 and W2 as described by them including the purchase of guns, soliciting others to kill John Newman and the three previous attempts on his life, may well have occurred, those activities were not instigated or procured by him. I am satisfied that these earlier events were done at his instigation and on his behalf; he was the person with the motive and by reason of his standing in the community, his authority in the Mekong Club, and his personal interest in their welfare, he clearly exercised a strong influence over W1 and W2, and their activities in this regard all revolved around him and/or the Mekong Club which was in a very real sense his alter ego. 22 The prisoner has not been charged with or convicted of, these earlier attempts and he is not to be punished for them: The Queen v de Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383, but they are relevant to demonstrate his planning and determination over a long period of time to bring about the actual killing on 5 September and persistence in his design notwithstanding previous failures. Although he was not the actual shooter, I regard him as the principal offender, and proceed accordingly. 23 Not only is the deliberate, premeditated killing of another human being a most serious offence at any time, the criminality in the present case is greatly aggravated because it involved the killing of a member of Parliament for political ends. It therefore constituted an offence not only against the individual victim, but it was also a direct attack on our system of democratic representative government, and struck at the very fabric of our public institutions.24 We are all aware that our system of parliamentary democracy has its defects, but when one considers other democratic systems around the world it can fairly be said that our system is as good as, if not better than, most, if not all, of the others.25 In particular our system of parliamentary elections and pre-selection of parliamentary candidates operates without physical violence or intimidation, and a clear message must be sent that there is no room in this country for killings, violence or intimidation as part of the political process.26 Section 19A of the Crimes Act 1900 provides that a person convicted of murder is liable to life imprisonment, although s 21(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 permits the Court to impose a sentence of imprisonment for a specified term. Section 61(1) of the latter Act directs the Court to impose a sentence of life imprisonment if the Court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that “the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence” can only be met through the imposition of such a sentence, although s 61(3) restores the effect of s 21(1). These provisions and the relationship between them were considered in some detail in R v Harris [2000] NSWCCA 469; 50 NSWLR 409, and it is appropriate to firstly consider the level of culpability of the prisoner in the commission of the offence and whether the case is one calling for a life sentence in terms of s 61(1); and if so, whether in the exercise of the discretion conferred by s 21(1) the subjective features relating to the prisoner justify a lesser sentence of imprisonment for a specified term: Harris at [94]. 27 As it was pointed out in Harris at [86] to [92], although the criterion in s 61(1) may not be identical to the criterion for a life sentence at common law, which was the “worst category of case”, nevertheless cases decided under the common law are generally relevant to a consideration of the degree of culpability referred to in s 61(1) as requiring the imposition of life imprisonment. The position at common law was summarised by Hunt CJ at CL in R v Kalajzich (1997) 94 A Crim R 41 at 50-57 as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        “The maximum penalty for murder of penal servitude for life, meaning for the term of the prisoner's natural life, is … reserved for cases falling within the worst category of cases, but it is not reserved only for those cases where the prisoner is likely to remain a continuing danger to society for the rest of his life or for those cases where there is no chance of rehabilitation; the maximum may be appropriate where the level of culpability is so extreme that the community interest in retribution and punishment can only be met by such a punishment. It must nevertheless be possible in the individual case to point to its particular features which are of very great heinousness, and there must be an absence of any facts mitigating the objective seriousness of the crime (as distinct from any subjective features mitigating the penalty to be imposed).”  
        
       
      
    28 Such cases have generally involved killings which were sex related, thrill killings, killings involving extended suffering by the victim or extraordinary violence, multiple killings or cases where the prisoner is a continuing danger to the community (see cases cited by Hunt CJ at CL at 51 n25, and also R v Barker (unreported – NSWCCA – 20 September 1995), R v Rose [1999] NSWCCA 327, R v Fernando [1999] NSWCCA 66); but these categories are not closed and the test to be applied under s 61 directs attention to the “community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence”. 29 In R v Kocan [1966] 2 NSWR 565 the appellant had pleaded guilty to the charge of wounding with intent to murder the then leader of the Federal Opposition. The motive was not political gain for himself but the appellant, although not coming within the M’Naghten Rules, was mentally ill, abnormally obsessed with feelings of his unimportance and sought the achievement of some form of fame or notoriety by the killing of a well known figure. In imposing a life sentence, Herron CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I believe that is necessary for me to pass such sentence as may deter any other person from even considering the molestation and any attempt upon the life and safety of our public men. They must be allowed to go about their affairs of State with an entire appreciation that they are protected to the full extent of the law.” 
        
       
      
    30 The sentence was affirmed by the Court of Criminal Appeal where McClemens J said at 571: 
     
      
       
        
        “This country has been mercifully free from attacks on public men and it is the Court’s duty to take such steps as are available to it to see this state of affairs remains so. Therefore the Courts should indicate very plainly that this type of thing is not to be permitted.” 
        
       
      
    31 When sentencing David Eastman to life imprisonment for the murder of the Assistant Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Carruthers AJ referred to these remarks and said they “carry as much force now as they did in 1966 – if not more force”:  The Queen v Eastman (ACTSC - 10 November 1995) at 20. 32 In my opinion, the killing of a member of Parliament for political purposes, involving as it does an attack on our constitutional system of parliamentary democracy, and particularly when committed for personal political gain gives rise to such culpability that the “community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence” can only be met by the imposition of a life sentence. 33 These features are aggravated in the present case by the long period of planning and organisation which preceded the killing, and by the prisoner’s corruption of other persons such as W1, W2 and the persons who actually carried out the killing on his behalf.34 It therefore becomes necessary having regard to s 21(1) to consider whether there are any subjective features including prospects of rehabilitation that are such as render it inappropriate to impose a life sentence, while bearing in mind that in some cases the culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the subjective features should be disregarded: Harris at [103]. 35 The prisoner was born on 9 July 1958, is now 43 years old and has no previous convictions. He was born in Vietnam where his family had a chicken farm and was apparently moderately successful, but their life changed with the fall of Saigon in 1975 and he came to Australia in 1982 with his brother, whom he assisted in their early days in this country. The prisoner started his work employed by a flyscreen company in Punchbowl, but became successful and ultimately became not only the founder and Honorary President of the Mekong Club but also Deputy Mayor of Fairfield, and he also owned and published a Vietnamese Newspaper. 36 There was a large amount of evidence on sentence concerning the prisoner’s work for the community and I am satisfied that he worked very hard both as a Councillor and Deputy Mayor of the City of Fairfield, building bridges between Asian and other groups of the community and assisting constituents with their problems with Local Government and otherwise. He was instrumental in the formation of the Mekong Club which enabled Asian people, especially Vietnamese, to have their own club and support their ethnic community, he fostered an Asian language and culture school at weekends, and he caused the Mekong Club to employ his co-accused Quang Dao as a social worker to help members of the community. He was also instrumental through his efforts on Fairfield City Council in having the Fairfield Drug Intervention Centre established.37 Moreover, the evidence establishes that since he has been in custody on remand he has encouraged other young prisoners, particularly Asian prisoners, to better themselves by taking advantage of educational opportunities offered in the gaol. He has also, with the authorities’ approval, organised cultural and festival activities within the gaol. The evidence is to the effect that he is regarded by prison officers as a model prisoner and the other prisoners respect him.38 I am satisfied that the prisoner has done a lot of good in his area. He came to this country as a refugee and has achieved a great deal for himself and for other migrants and the Australian community generally, and the tragedy is that he had a lot more to offer. He thought he could be of greater service to the community if he was the member for Cabramatta, and quite possibly he could have, but tragically he was impatient and overly ambitious, and in seeking to become the member he not only deprived John Newman of his life, but destroyed any further potential which he himself may have had. 39 Consistent with his plea of not guilty there has been no expression of remorse or regret. I am satisfied that he is unlikely to re-offend, at least for political purposes, although a lack of evidence does not enable me to form a view as to whether there might be a risk of him offending again if his commercial or other interests were at stake. 40 Evidence emerged during the sentencing proceedings that the prisoner is currently “on protection” and it was submitted that service of a sentence on protection is a more arduous form of imprisonment and therefore needs to be taken into account when sentencing: AB v The Queen [1999] HCA 46, 198 CLR 111 per Kirby J at [105], R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 at 255. I therefore granted liberty to the prisoner’s legal representatives to submit further material in writing concerning the nature of his incarceration and the restrictions arising from his being “on protection”. 41 This material has now been received (which I have had marked as Exhibits X27, X28 and X29) and it establishes that he is in protective custody at the request of his legal representatives because of anonymous death threats made against him, and that he could apply to be taken off protection, an application which may not necessarily be granted. 42 I have taken all these matters into account but, for the reasons already given, I am satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the subjective features must be disregarded and the community interest as defined in s 61(1) can only be adequately met by a sentence of life imprisonment. 43 Where a life sentence is imposed, the Court has no power to set a non-parole period: Harris at [22]; and although I am satisfied that the prisoner should remain under sentence for the remainder of his life, nevertheless this is not a case where I believe he necessarily needs to be kept in custody for the whole of that time, and if I had the power to do so, I would fix a non-parole period, but it would be a very long one. I echo the remarks of Wood CJ at CL in Harris at [123] that Parliament might usefully give consideration to whether the Court should have power to fix a non-parole period in cases to which s 61(1) applies.44 Pursuant to s 28 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I have received and read the Victim Impact Statement prepared by the deceased’s brother. I acknowledge the grief and distress suffered by the victim’s mother and brother and it must be remembered that they have also suffered a tragic loss, although their loss is not relevant to the sentence appropriate to be imposed on the prisoner: R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76. 45 Phuong Canh Ngo for the murder of John Newman I sentence you to imprisonment for life.

        REGINA v VICTOR IAN MOUSSA 
        
        
        JUDGMENT 
        
        
       
     1    GILES JA: I agree with Howie J. 
      
       
     2    HOWIE J: The appellant was indicted before a jury on two counts of supplying a prohibited drug contrary to the provisions of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. Each count related to the supply of the drug commonly known as ecstasy and the first count concerned not less than a commercial quantity of that drug. The appellant was convicted on each count and sentenced by his Honour Judge Kinchington, on the first count, to imprisonment for 4½ years with a non-parole period of 3 years, and on the second count, to a fixed term of 3 years. The appellant appeals against his conviction but there is no application for leave to appeal against sentence. 
      
       
     3    Both offences arose from an incident when the appellant’s motor vehicle, in which he was travelling as a passenger, was stopped by two police officers. The circumstances in which the police officers came to require the vehicle to pull over and what happened thereafter were very much in dispute and were at the heart of the issues that the jury had to determine. In essence the Crown’s case was that, on searching the vehicle, the police found a quantity of tablets in a computer case in the boot. On analysis these tablets were found to be ecstasy. The two charges arose because there were two different types of drugs found in the case. The police officers gave evidence of a conversation with the appellant when the drugs were found in which, they alleged, the appellant admitted he was in possession of the tablets and from which the jury might infer that he knew they were prohibited drugs. 
      
       
     4    The appellant denied the version of the conversation given by the police officers. His case was that he had no knowledge of the computer bag or its contents and told this to the police officers. He gave evidence before the jury that a person named Gonclaves, who had been lent the vehicle by the appellant so that he could use it while repairs were carried out on his vehicle, must have placed the case in the boot. There was evidence called in the defence case of an allegation that Gonclaves had supplied ecstasy tablets to another person on another occasion. 
      
       
     5    The single issue for the jury to determine was whether they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the version given by the police officers of what happened after the appellant’s vehicle was stopped by them was a reliable one. The trial was hotly contested on both sides. There was a number of, what his Honour in his summing up referred to as, peripheral issues that went chiefly to the credit of the police officers. One of these related to a defence exhibit (Exhibit 1) that purported to be a guarantee for tinting of the windows of the appellant’s motor vehicle. By the end of the trial there was no dispute that this document was a forgery. The significance of this matter in the trial gives rise to one of the grounds of appeal and I will return to it later in this judgment. 
      
       
     6    There were two main issues relating to admissibility of evidence that the trial judge needed to determine. These were at the crux of the Crown’s case, and were concerned with the legality of the search of the appellant’s vehicle and the admissibility of the conversation that took place after the computer bag was discovered in the boot. These two matters formed the subject of a voir dire hearing and pre-trial ruling by his Honour. It should be apparent by now that his Honour resolved the questions of the admissibility of this evidence in favour of the Crown. His decisions in that regard are the subject of the first two grounds of appeal to which I will now turn. 
      
       
        
       Admissibility of evidence of the search 
        
       
     7    The first ground of appeal concerns the admissibility of the evidence of the search of the appellant’s vehicle and the finding of the drugs in the computer case. The issue that arose was the lawfulness of the search of the appellant’s vehicle. The particular matters, which the trial judge was called upon to determine, were, firstly, whether the appellant had consented to the search, and, secondly, if he had not, whether the search was authorised under s 357 of the Crimes Act. Because in my view the attack upon his Honour’s finding on the first of those matters lacks any merit, it is unnecessary to refer in detail to the second. However, the particular question arising under that provision was whether the police officer had reasonable grounds to suspect that the appellant was in possession of a pistol in the motor vehicle. 
      
       
     8    The evidence given by Constable Zimmerman was that on 29 May 1997, while on patrol in a police vehicle, he saw a Commodore vehicle turn right at a set of traffic lights. As it did so, the four occupants looked toward the police vehicle. The officer thought that this was unusual and requested that the driver of the police car, Constable Grosse, follow the vehicle. Constable Zimmerman made a check of the registration number of the vehicle and was informed that the registration had been cancelled for fine default. The siren of the police car was activated and in response the vehicle pulled over to the side of the road. 
      
       
     9    The appellant was in the front passenger seat when the police officers approached the vehicle. A conversation took place between the officer and the appellant in relation to the status of his licence. After making some inquiries, the officer informed the appellant that his licence had been cancelled and that the appellant had been made aware of that fact some days earlier by the highway patrol. The appellant was then asked whether he held a current pistol licence and, according to Constable Zimmerman, he confirmed that he did. 
      
       
     10    Constable Zimmerman gave evidence that the appellant at this time appeared “very agitated, very nervous” and was “shuffling from foot to foot”. The officer formed the view that the appellant might be carrying a pistol and decided to search the motor vehicle to look for “anything illegal that didn’t belong to him that I should know about”. He said that this included a pistol. According to the officer the following conversation took place: 
      
       
        
         
         “I’m now going to search your car. Is there anything in the car that is illegal or does not belong to you that I should know about?” 
         
        
        
         
         The [appellant] then said: “No, go ahead and search it.” 
         
        
        
       The appellant, at the officer’s request, opened the boot of the vehicle and the constable then made a search, locating the computer bag containing the tablets. 
        
       
     11    The appellant gave a different version of these events. He said that after the vehicle stopped Constable Zimmerman asked him if he was the owner of the vehicle and, when he affirmed that he was, he was told to step out of the vehicle. A conversation, which it is unnecessary to relate, then took place about the appellant’s licence. The appellant gave evidence that, when asked if he had a pistol licence, he said that he did not. 
      
       
     12    In evidence in chief on the voir dire the appellant stated that Constable Zimmerman then said, “We are now going to search the car. Have you got anything in the car that is not supposed to be there?”. The appellant answered, “No”. The constable was given the keys by the driver and opened the boot and searched it. 
      
       
     13    In cross-examination of the appellant the following questions and answers occurred: 
      
       
        
         
         Q. Then he told you “I’m going to search your car is there anything in the car that is illegal or does not belong to you that I should know about”? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No his exact words were “Is there anything in the car that’s not supposed to be there”. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You said, “No, go ahead and search it”? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s right. 
         
        
       
     14    The defence submission made to the trial judge at the conclusion of the voir dire was that his Honour should find that the search was unlawful because the police officer did not have the consent of the appellant to search his vehicle and had no reasonable grounds to suspect that the appellant was in possession of a pistol. It was further submitted that, if the search was found to be illegal, his Honour should refuse to admit the evidence, see s 138 of the Evidence Act. 
      
       
     15    At the conclusion of the voir dire the trial judge indicated that he intended to admit the evidence and gave a short statement of his reasons for this decision. After referring briefly to the evidence in the voir dire, his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Having considered that evidence and the competing submissions made on behalf of the Crown and the accused overnight, I have come to the conclusion firstly that the evidence in question was not improperly obtained and secondly that even if it was improperly obtained that I should not exercise my discretion in favour of the accused and exclude it from being placed before the jury to be sworn herein.” 
         
        
        
       The trial judge gave more extensive reasons about a week later to the same effect and it is unnecessary to refer to that judgment. 
        
       
     16    There are two things that can be said about the determination made by his Honour on the question of the admissibility of the evidence of the search and the finding of the tablets: first, the appellant bore the onus of proving on the balance of probabilities that the search was unlawful or improper within the terms of s 138 of the Evidence Act; second, the findings made by his Honour were matters of fact. 
      
       
     17    This Court has a limited power to intervene on questions of fact decided by a trial judge when determining whether to admit or reject evidence. The Court cannot overturn a trial judge’s finding of fact simply because it would have come to a different finding. This is particularly so where, as here, the finding is based principally on a determination of the credit of witnesses who gave evidence before the trial judge. In R v Kyriakou (1987) 29 A Crim R 50 at 57 Yeldham J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, said: 
      
       
        
         
         “His Honour held that the confession was voluntary. That was a finding of fact which it was open to him to make, and I am quite unable to conclude that he erred in that conclusion. This Court does not sit in judgment from factual findings made by trial judges on the voir dire. If there is no evidence to support a finding, or if a judge has applied wrong principles, or if the evidence is all one way, then this court, in order to prevent injustice, will intervene, but I am far from satisfied that the present situation is a case of this nature.” 
          
         
        
       
     18    In R v O’Donoghue (1988) 34 A Crim R 397, Hunt J (as he then was), giving the leading judgment of the Court, stated: 
      
       
        
         
         “Before considering that submission, it is as well to make clear the limits to this Court's power to review the decision of a trial judge to admit evidence of a confessional type. Although the admissibility of evidence is a question of law, that decision, particularly where there has been a voir dire, will often depend in turn upon the resolution of factual issues by the trial judge (and not the jury) and sometimes upon the exercise of a discretion by him. The usual limits upon an appeal against the exercise of a discretion are well known, but those upon an appeal from such findings of the trial judge in a criminal trial do not appear to be so well known.  
         
        
        
         
         It is important to emphasise that, unlike appeals to the Court of Appeal in civil cases, an appeal to this Court is not by way of rehearing. An appeal which is not by way of rehearing is no more than the right to have a superior court interpose to redress the error of the court below:  
         A-G v Sillem 
          (1864) 10 HLC 704 at 724; 11 ER 1200 at 1209;  
         Victorian Stevedoring & General Contracting Co Pty Ltd v Dignan 
          (1931) 46 CLR 73 at 109. Error may be demonstrated if there is no evidence to support a particular finding, or if the evidence is all one way, or if the judge has misdirected himself. But this Court has no power to substitute its own findings for those of the trial judge. The members of this Court may individually disagree with the findings which were made, but the court cannot for that reason interfere with those findings. It is only where the very narrow basis upon which this Court can intervene in relation to a trial judge's findings of fact has been established that the conviction can be set aside, and then only if the error has led to a miscarriage of justice: see  
         Merritt and Roso 
          (1985) 19 A Crim R 360 at 372-373;  
         Kyriakou 
          (1987) 29 A Crim R 50 at 60-61.  
         
        
        
       Similar statements have been made in numerous judgments of this Court, see  
       R v Khouzame 
        [2000] NSWCCA 505 in which reference is made to many of these decisions. 
        
       
     19    In my opinion it was well open to his Honour to determine the facts as he did. It cannot be said that there was no evidence upon which he could find that the appellant gave his consent to the search of the vehicle or that it was unreasonable to make that finding. Even though the appellant’s consent may have been irrelevant so far as the police officer was concerned, if the appellant did in fact consent to the search, then it could not be illegal. This is so regardless of the state of mind of the police officer or whether or not the search was authorised under any statutory provision: DPP v Leonard [2001] NSWSC 797. It is, therefore, unnecessary for this Court to determine whether it was open to his Honour to find that the police officer had reasonable grounds for the suspicion that entitled him to search the vehicle. 
      
       
     20    It is also unnecessary in determining this ground of appeal to consider the exercise of the discretion by the trial judge under s 138. However, I simply note that, from what his Honour said about how he would have exercised that discretion, he would have been in error had he been required to exercise it. His Honour appears to have misapprehended the nature of the discretion arising under s 138(1). If the trial judge had found that the search was unlawful or improper within the terms of s 138, then the question he was to ask himself was whether the evidence should be admitted on the basis of the balancing exercise required to be performed under the section and taking matters relevant to that exercise into account, including the various matters referred to in s 138(2). Before the evidence could be admitted, the discretion had to be exercised in favour of the Crown and not, as his Honour appears to have believed, in favour of the appellant. 
      
       
        
       Admissibility of evidence of admissions 
        
       
     21    The second ground of appeal asserts that his Honour erred in admitting the evidence of statements allegedly made by the appellant to the police officer when the tablets were found in the computer bag. It is unnecessary to set out these statements because there is no suggestion that they did not fall within the definition of an “admission” for the purposes of s 424A of the Crimes Act, the provision governing the admissibility of the evidence at the time of the trial, see now s 108 of the Criminal Procedure Act; and R v Horton (1998) 45 NSWLR 426 and R v Esposito (1998) 45 NSWLR 442. The statements were relied upon by the Crown to prove that the appellant had knowledge both of the presence of the tablets in the bag and that they were prohibited drugs and hence that he was in possession of them. 
      
       
     22    It was conceded by the Crown, both before the trial judge and before this Court, that, because the police officers had not electronically recorded the statements allegedly made by the appellant at the boot of the vehicle, the evidence concerning them could not be admitted unless the trial judge found that s 424A had been satisfied. The onus was upon the Crown to persuade the trial judge of that matter on the balance of probabilities. 
      
       
     23    Section 424A was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         ""424A. Admission by suspects

           (b) if the prosecution establishes that there was a reasonable excuse as to why a tape recording referred to in paragraph (a) could not be made, there is available to the court a tape recording of an interview with the person who made the admission about the making and terms of the admission in the course of which the person states that he or she made an admission in those terms, or  
            
           (c) the prosecution establishes that there was a reasonable excuse as to why the tape recordings referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) could not be made.  
           
          
         (3) The hearsay rule and the opinion rule (within the meaning of the Evidence Act 1995) do not prevent the admission or use of a tape recording as mentioned in subsection (2).

     24    Before the evidence could be admitted, the trial judge had to be satisfied that there was a reasonable excuse both for the failure to record the admissions when they were made to Constable Zimmerman at the boot of the motor vehicle and for the failure to record at a later time any adoption by the appellant of the admissions alleged to have been made by him. 
      
       
     25    Once again it should be noted that a finding as to whether a reasonable excuse exists for the failure to make a recording of an admission under s 424A is a finding of fact. In respect of the failure to record the admissions at the boot of the vehicle, the trial judge held that there was a reasonable excuse because it was impracticable for Constable Zimmerman to have made an electronic recording of that conversation. No challenge is made to that finding on the hearing of this appeal. 
      
       
     26    However, there is a challenge made to the finding of the trial judge that there was a reasonable excuse for the failure to make an electronic recording of an adoption by the appellant of the earlier admissions and, therefore, it is necessary to refer very briefly to the evidence concerning the failure of the police to make any recording of an adoption by the appellant of the earlier admissions. 
      
       
     27    On 17 July 1999 the appellant and his solicitor voluntarily attended at Canterbury police station. Constable Colreavy said to the appellant in the presence of his solicitor: 
      
       
        
         
         “I wish to ask you some questions in relation to an incident where 654 tablets were located in the boot of your car on Thursday 29 May this year. These tablets have been analysed at the Government Laboratories and found to be ecstasy. You are not obliged to answer my questions or say anything unless you wish to do so but whatever you do say will be recorded and may later be used in evidence. Do you understand that?” 
         
        
        
       After the appellant replied, “ 
       Yes 
       ”, his solicitor said, “ 
       My client does not wish to make a statement 
       ”. The Constable then asked the appellant, “ 
       Are you prepared to be interviewed in relation to this matter? 
       ” and the appellant replied, “ 
       No 
       ”. The appellant was then asked, “ 
       Do you wish to make a handwritten statement in relation to this matter 
       ?” and he again replied, “ 
       No 
       ”. There was no dispute that this conversation occurred and the appellant signed a notation of it in the Constable’s notebook. Constable Colreavy did not give evidence on the voir dire. 
        
       
     28    The submissions made by defence counsel to the trial judge both before and after the voir dire make it clear that the major attack was upon the failure of Constable Zimmerman to record the conversations with the appellant at the vehicle or shortly thereafter. But there was also an argument put that the refusal of the appellant to participate in an interview or to make a statement on 17 July did not necessarily mean that there was a reasonable excuse for the failure to record an adoption of the earlier admissions, notwithstanding the definition of “reasonable excuse” in s 424A. 
      
       
     29    In support of that submission defence counsel relied upon the decision of this Court in Schiavini (1999) 108 A Crim R 161. In that case the initial statements allegedly made by the appellant were not electronically recorded. When later the appellant was asked by a police officer, “Do you wish to be interviewed by electronic means, by that I mean audio and visual recording?”, he replied that he did not. The trial judge held that, because the police officer had limited the type of recording on offer to the accused to a video and audio recording and did not give him the alternative of an audio recording alone, there was no reasonable excuse for the failure to record the adoption of the alleged admissions. Although the accused’s statements were held to be inadmissible under s 424A, the trial judge determined to admit them under s 86 of the Evidence Act. 
      
       
     30    This Court held that the trial judge was in error in allowing the evidence to be admitted under s 86 because the admissibility of the evidence was governed exclusively by s 424A. The Crown then sought to justify the admission of the evidence upon the basis that it was not open to the trial judge to find that there was no reasonable excuse for the failure to make an electronic recording of the adoption of the alleged admissions. Studdert J, with whose judgment the other members of the Court concurred, stated: 
      
       
        
         
         [17] The Crown has submitted however that the trial judge was wrong in concluding that s 424A compelled the exclusion of the evidence. It was submitted that to construe what the police officer said to the appellant, namely ""Do you wish to be interviewed by electronic means, by that I mean audio and visual recording"" as meaning only a combined audio and visual recording, was artificial and that the response could reasonably have been taken to amount to a refusal to be interviewed by either means. Having regard to the object intended to be served by s 424A, prudence requires that any interviewing officer explain to a person being interviewed in relation to an indictable offence the alternative forms of ""tape recording"" available. It is conceivable that a person being interviewed may be prepared to be interviewed by way of audio recording but not by way of video recording. However even assuming the correctness of the Crown submission it would not follow that s 424A(2) was satisfied in the circumstances of this case.  
         
        
       
     31    Studdert J concluded that the section was not satisfied because the police conducted a further interview with the appellant that was electronically recorded but during which the interviewing police officer did not put to the appellant the admissions allegedly made by him earlier. Studdert J held that the police officer should have put the earlier admissions to the appellant even though that interview related to only one of the charges then before the court. After referring to the purpose of s 424A and the legislative policy behind the section as declared in Horton, Studdert J stated: 
      
       
        
         
         [21] The strict requirements of s 424A(2) reflect the legislative purpose as recognised in  
         Horton 
         . The sub-section requires that there be a tape recording which satisfies either sub-s (2)(a) or (2)(b). Otherwise evidence of an admission is not admissible unless the prosecution establishes  
         ""that there was a reasonable excuse as to why the tape recordings referred to in paragraphs (a)  
         and 
          (b)  
         could 
          not be made"" 
         . The use of the word ""could"" introduces a concept of impracticability in order to excuse the lack of a tape recording.  
         (His Honour’s emphasis). 
         
        
       
     32    Later in his judgment, when determining that the evidence was not admissible, Studdert J stated: 
      
       
        
         
         “[24] In my opinion, having regard to the evidence concerning the later electronically recorded evidence, the prosecution here failed to establish that there was a reasonable excuse as to why it was not possible for the type of recording contemplated in s 424A(2)(b) to have been made in June 1998. This being so, the strict requirements for admissibility under s 424A(2) were not satisfied and it follows that the evidence here challenged was wrongly admitted.” 
         
        
       
     33    In my opinion, so far as is presently relevant, Schiavini is a decision that, on the facts and circumstances of the matter then before the Court, the Crown had not satisfied the requirements of s 424A. The decision does not determine how the trial judge should have found the facts in the present matter. There is scope for minds legitimately to differ as to whether a reasonable excuse has been made out in a particular factual context. It is not for this Court to circumscribe the factual findings available to the trial courts. Provided that those findings are open on the evidence and are made consistently with the purpose of the section and with regard to the mischief that Parliament sought to address, this Court should not interfere with what is essentially the function of the trial judge. 
      
       
     34    On the appeal, it was submitted that there was no reasonable excuse in the refusal of the appellant to participate in an interview with Constable Colreavy because the appellant should have been informed by the police officer that it was alleged that he had admitted to ownership of the tablets in his conversation with Constable Zimmerman. It was argued that, if this had been done, the appellant could have made an informed decision whether or not to participate in an interview. It was submitted that for a court to find otherwise would undermine the legislative purpose behind the provision and permit unscrupulous police officers to manufacture an admission subsequent to the refusal to be interviewed. 
      
       
     35    In my view the trial judge was entitled to find that the Crown had made out a reasonable excuse in a situation where the appellant declined to be interviewed at all in relation to the matter in respect of which earlier admissions had allegedly been made. In the present case, it was significant that the appellant was accompanied by a solicitor and that immediately after the constable gave the caution the solicitor indicated that his client would not make a statement. It was open to the trial judge to find that it was reasonable for the police officer in that situation simply to accept the appellant’s refusal to be interviewed or make a statement “in relation to the matter”. It may have been prudent for the police officer to indicate to the appellant that it was being alleged that he had made admissions to Constable Zimmerman. It may also have been prudent for the solicitor accompanying the appellant to have inquired of the police officer what was being alleged before giving advice to the appellant not to make any statement or participate in an interview. Prudence by a police officer in what is said and done at the time of the request to the accused to be interviewed may ensure that the evidence is admitted despite the differing views of judicial officers as to what is, or is not, reasonable in any given situation. But a lack of prudence does not equate with a lack of reasonableness. 
      
       
     36    This is not to suggest that a trial judge has free rein in determining what is or is not a reasonable excuse under the section. The purpose for which the section was enacted is obviously important in determining that question. But in my opinion this Court should avoid declaring that any particular set of facts will, or will not, result in a finding of a reasonable excuse. It is not for the Court to take over the role of the legislature. Unless a particular finding is not reasonably open on the evidence, having regard to the terms of the section and the policy to which it gives effect, then there is no basis for this Court to substitute its finding for that of the trial judge. 
      
       
     37    On the hearing of the appeal and when faced with the difficulty of persuading this Court to overturn a finding of fact, Senior Counsel for the appellant sought to attack the trial judge’s finding on the basis that his Honour had failed to give sufficient reasons for it. As I have already indicated, his Honour delivered short reasons immediately on completion of the voir dire and about a week later, before the trial commenced, gave more detailed reasons. The criticism made of the trial judge’s reasons is that his Honour did not specifically address the argument, which it was said was put to him and as was put to this Court: that, if a reasonable excuse were found on these facts, it would leave it open for police to manufacture admissions after the suspect had refused to be interviewed. 
      
       
     38    It does not appear from the transcript that this argument was ever put to the trial judge nor was reliance placed on the failure to inform the appellant that he was alleged to have made admissions to Constable Zimmerman. At the outset of the voir dire hearing, defence counsel was outlining what would be the issues raised before his Honour and referred the trial judge to Schiavini. Although counsel made a comment that the appellant, when he attended at the police station, had never been told that he was alleged to have made admissions, that matter appears to have been referred to only in passing both before and after the voir dire and not as a ground for rejecting the admissions. The major complaints raised with the trial judge were that Constable Zimmerman had failed to record the admissions initially and that Constable Colreavy had not given the appellant the opportunity to be recorded on video or audio tape. During the course of the discussion, defence counsel said to the trial judge: 
      
       
        
         
         If my friend is relying on Colreavy’s evidence to prove reasonable excuse as she must do under the section she fails to do so because there is nothing in Colreavy’s evidence even suggesting that the accused can involve himself with a tape recorder or an ERISP interview therefore he’s never given-- 
         
        
        
         
         He was never asked. He was asked would he prefer to be interviewed but he was never asked whether he’d be interviewed on an ERISP…. 
         
        
        
       Defence counsel submitted that  
       Schiavini 
        required that the appellant be specifically asked if he wished to be interviewed by the ERISP procedure, and, as the appellant had not been given that opportunity, there was no reasonable excuse for the failure to make such a recording. 
        
       
     39    As I have already noted Constable Colreavy was not called on the voir dire. Before the voir dire commenced there was some discussion as to what witnesses would be required by the defence. At one stage defence counsel stated: 
      
       
        
         
         The reason I asked that Colreavy be called is because we would say that the procedure adopted by Colreavy in the manner in which he undertook the interview with my client on the subsequent date is consistent with protocol and the proper procedure to be adopted and if my friend concedes that then his evidence already being before you can be contrasted with the evidence already before your Honour through Constable Zimmerman and further evidence in cross-examination so to that extent I do not require Colreavy to be called, providing my friend concedes that the procedure adopted by that particular police officer is the proper one. 
         
        
        
       Later counsel confirmed with the trial judge that he had no complaint with the way Constable Colreavy treated his client, other than that he was not offered an ERISP recorded interview. 
        
       
     40    After his Honour delivered his decision on the admissibility of the admissions and gave his initial brief reasons, defence counsel raised again the decision in Schiavini on the basis that, what he regarded as, the strict test to be applied to s 424A had not been followed by the trial judge. Counsel’s complaint again was only that the applicant was not offered the opportunity to be interviewed by way of electronic recording. 
      
       
     41    In my opinion, having regard to the manner in which the matter was argued before his Honour and the issues that he was called upon to determine, there was no defect in his Honour’s reasons given for admitting the evidence of the admissions. Certainly there was no error of law arising from those reasons or their content. The second ground also fails. 
      
       
        
       Directions in respect of Exhibit 1 
        
       
     42    One of the factual issues that arose during the trial, was the assertion by Constable Zimmerman that he could see the four occupants of the appellant’s vehicle looking in the direction of the police car as the vehicle made a right hand turn. The officer said that it was this conduct that attracted his interest in the appellant’s vehicle. However, the appellant maintained that the windows of his vehicle were tinted at the time and that the officer would not have been able to see the occupants clearly. 
      
       
     43    During the cross-examination of Constable Zimmerman, the defence tendered, what purported to be, a guarantee issued to the appellant in respect of the tinting of the windows of his vehicle at a time before he was stopped by the police officers. This document was marked Exhibit 1. It became clear from evidence called in the Crown case, after the tender of the exhibit, that the document was a forgery: it could not have come into existence before May 1997. It is unnecessary to detail the reasons why the document could not have been genuine because it’s falsity was not in dispute by the time the appellant gave evidence about it. 
      
       
     44    The appellant told the jury that in October of the previous year the document had been sent to him by mail with a note wishing him luck. He said that he did not know who sent the document to him and that he believed it was genuine when he received it. Defence counsel in his address raised with the jury, without any basis to do so, the possibility that the police had produced the document to ensnare the appellant. 
      
       
     45    The subject of whether or not Constable Zimmerman could see the four persons in the vehicle was of very limited relevance to the real issue before the jury. It was a matter that, initially at least, went only to the credit of the police officer. But, the relevance of Exhibit 1 changed dramatically once it was established that the document was a forgery: it then assumed more relevance to the appellant’s credit than to that of the police officers. It was clearly open to the jury to find that the appellant had been involved in the forgery of Exhibit 1 or that he had lied in relation to his account of how he came to receive it. 
      
       
     46    The complaint made under this ground of appeal is that the trial judge should have given either a direction in accordance with Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193 or a warning such was suggested in Zoneff v The Queen (2000) 200 CLR 234. Edwards was concerned with the directions to be given where the Crown relies upon lies told by the accused as evidence of a consciousness of guilt. Zoneff was concerned with a warning necessary to ensure that the jury did not embark upon a prohibited line of reasoning that led from the telling of a lie by the accused to a finding of guilt of the offence charged. 
      
       
     47    The justices in the majority judgment in Zoneff were at pains to point out the unusual factual situation that arose at the trial with which they were concerned. The accused had been unrepresented and, although there was a substantial attack upon his credibility during cross-examination of him, the Crown had never raised the issue of whether the lies told by him could be used by the jury as evidence of a consciousness of guilt. However, the trial judge raised this issue during the summing up and referred to the subject of a consciousness of guilt without giving a direction on that matter in accordance with Edwards. 
      
       
     48    The majority of the High Court held that a miscarriage of justice had arisen in that case because the relevance of the lies told by the accused was left “largely up in the air” by the trial judge. The majority in their joint judgment stated: 
      
       
        
         
         [23]  
         A direction which might have appropriately been given and which would have allayed any concerns which the trial judge may have had, in this unusual case, in which the issues may not have been defined as they might have been had the prosecutor made a speech to the jury, is one in these terms:  
          
           
           ""You have heard a lot of questions, which attribute lies to the accused. You will make up your own mind about whether he was telling lies and if he was, whether he was doing so deliberately. It is for you to decide what significance those suggested lies have in relation to the issues in the case but I give you this warning: do not follow a process of reasoning to the effect that just because a person is shown to have told a lie about something, that is evidence of guilt."" 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         [24]  
         A direction in such terms may well be adaptable to other cases in which there is a risk of a misunderstanding about the significance of possible lies even though the prosecution has not suggested that the accused told certain lies because he or she knew the truth would implicate him or her in the commission of the offence. 
         
        
       
     49    The warning suggested was necessary in that case because there was a risk that the jury would reason toward the guilt of the accused from the lies told by him even though such a line of reasoning was not relied upon by the Crown and was not available to them. The trial judge raised the issue of a consciousness of guilt arising from the lies told by the accused without any identification of the relevant answers to the questions he raised and without any further explanation, thus inviting the jury to infer that the lies might be indicative of a consciousness of guilt without the prosecution relying upon such an inference and without the jury receiving proper assistance on that matter. 
      
       
     50    The question that arises in the present case is whether there was a risk that the jury might infer from the fact, if they found it to be the fact, that the appellant had lied about how he came to have possession of Exhibit 1 that he was guilty of the offences for which he stood trial. Although there is no transcript of the Crown’s address, there has been no suggestion that the Crown raised the issue of consciousness of guilt in its address or otherwise. Certainly the trial judge did not raise this issue in the summing up. However, it has been submitted on behalf of the appellant that Exhibit 1 became so significant that the jury had to be warned not to misuse either it or the appellant’s evidence about it. 
      
       
     51    Before he commenced to sum up to the jury, the trial judge appropriately sought the assistance of counsel as to the directions that should be given to the jury on various issues that had arisen during the trial. The following exchange with defence counsel is recorded (with obvious corrections to the transcript): 
      
       
        
         
         HIS HONOUR:……… A direction on lies. What are you seek(ing) there?  
          
          
         McCRUDDEN: Well your Honour there [is] a (R v )Lucas direction which as your Honour is aware it was (ap)proved in  
         Edwards 
         , but in  
         Edwards 
          – 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: Well what direction do you seek? I mean I don’t know, there’s a direction on lies that a jury are entitled to draw an inference if they come to a conclusion the accused lied, that it shows a consciousness of guilt, I’m sure you’re not getting at that sort of a direction. 
          
          
         McCRUDDEN: Well that’s correct your Honour the – 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: I mean if the jury in this case - what you’ve said, you’ve said the police have lied they’ve made up their version of event, if the jury are satisfied that’s the situation, that’s the end of the matter isn’t it? And I’ll tell the jury that. 
          
          
         McCRUDDEN: Yes your Honour. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: Nothing else arises from it other than that does it? 
          
          
         McCRUDDEN: That’s correct your Honour yes. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: It’s as simple as that. 
         
        
       
     52    Clearly his Honour perceived that the single issue, which arose from the evidence, was whether the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the police officers were reliable in their account of the conversations with the appellant. There was some doubt expressed on the hearing of the appeal as to what it was to which counsel and the trial judge were referring: whether it was what the accused said about Exhibit 1 or the lies allegedly told by the appellant to the police when they found the tablets in the boot. Material filed on the hearing of the appeal, to which I shall refer shortly, seems to confirm that the exchange referred to Exhibit 1. However, it is apparent that experienced defence counsel conceded that his Honour’s analysis of the issues raised in the trial was correct and, in effect, withdrew any request for a direction in accordance with Edwards. 
      
       
     53    Consequently, throughout the summing up, the trial judge directed the jury, on a number of occasions and in an impeccably fair manner, that the real issue for their determination was whether they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the reliability of the evidence of the police officers. Understandably, there was some reference by his Honour to Exhibit 1 and the competing arguments about it. The Crown had apparently placed significance both on the tendering of the exhibit and the accused’s evidence in respect of it. The trial judge reminded the jury that the Crown’s submission was that they would not believe the appellant’s version of how he came to receive the document, but that defence counsel had submitted that they would accept the appellant’s account. The trial judge said to the jury: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Crown says that the material contained on that document could have only been known to the accused, particularly as to the registration number of the car and that material together with the - and specifies the date. Well the date does not even agree the Crown says, with what the accused says. The car was tinted before May, and yet is tendered before you at an early time to establish the car had tinted windows. The Crown says that you will reject the accused’s version as to how he came to get that thing, anonymously through the post, yet tendered it in evidence in these proceedings.” 
         
        
        
       His Honour then went on to address the submission made by defence counsel that the police may have sent the document to the appellant. 
        
       
     54    It is apparent that his Honour saw Exhibit 1 as raising an issue only going to the credit of the appellant. Late in the summing up, in what his Honour believed would be the final directions of law, his Honour said, after referring to the addresses of both counsel in respect of the evidence of the police officers:  
      
       
        
         
         Well they are the competing submissions, when they are reduced down there has been evidence as to colours of cars, there has been evidence as to tinting of windows. All those matters you may think are peripheral, it is a matter for you, to the main issue that is before you. Those peripheral matters may help you in determining what you make of the main issues. The real issues that arise from these proceedings is which is, are you satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the conversation that Constable Zimmerman and Grosse said took place on this night, does that conversation have a ring of truth in the context in which it occurred and in which these young constables found themselves. The Crown says it does, the accused says it does not. They have made it all up.” 
         
        
        
       Unlike the situation in  
       Zoneff 
       , the trial judge never made any reference to the lies being used as establishing the guilt of the accused. 
        
       
     55    No further direction was sought by counsel on this issue at the end of the summing up and that is, in my view, consistent with a valid tactical decision. There had been no suggestion in the summing up that there was any evidence indicative of the guilt of the appellant other than the challenged evidence of the police officers. Counsel may well have thought that there was nothing to be gained by introducing any suggestion that the evidence relating to Exhibit 1 could go to the guilt of the appellant by asking for a direction similar to that suggested in Zoneff. 
      
       
     56    I have already indicated that in respect of this ground of appeal an affidavit by trial counsel was filed on behalf of the appellant. This is in accordance with a practice that has developed in relation to applications for leave under rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules in respect of a point not raised at the trial. In R v Hines (1991) 24 NSWLR 737 at 743 Sully J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, stated: 
      
       
        
         
          
         For my own part, I consider that it should become the fixed practice of this Court that in a case where the person who is to appear for the appellant on the hearing of the appeal did not appear for the appellant at the trial, there should be filed an affidavit which puts before this Court such explanation as it might be desired to advance for the failure to take, at the proper time and in the proper form, at trial an objection upon which it is sought to rely on the hearing of the appeal. I feel very strongly that a failure on the part of this Court to take such a stand will detract seriously from the efficient administration of criminal justice according to law. That efficient administration of criminal justice requires imperatively, — although, no doubt, among other things, — the affording by the legal profession of proper assistance to trial judges. A fundamentally important aspect of that professional duty of assistance is the duty to take at the proper time and in the proper way proper objections to the trial judge's summing-up in a particular case. If, in a particular case, counsel or a solicitor representing an accused person simply overlooked the point at trial, then I can see nothing harsh or unreasonable in expecting that practitioner to own up to the oversight when the point is sought to be raised for the first time on appeal. If the practitioner has some other explanation of substance for the failure to take the point at trial, then, again, I can see nothing untoward in this Court's expecting to be told what the explanation might be. Such an approach applied consistently and sensibly by this Court would, I venture to suggest, instil into the conduct of criminal trials a degree of intellectual discipline, to say nothing of proper professional pride and responsibility, all of which qualities appear to me, if I may say, to be sadly lacking, not, to be sure, in all criminal trials, but certainly in a good many.  
         
        
       
     57    Unfortunately Sully J’s hope that such a procedure would encourage counsel to fulfil their duty to assist the trial judge has not been realised to any significant degree, if at all. However, the importance of this type of material has been recognised by other members of this Court, although with some reservations, see R v Leonard (NSWCCA, unreported, 4 August 1993) but cf R v Bryant (NSWCCA, unreported, 27 June 1994). 
      
       
     58    It has been my experience, limited as it is, that counsel appearing for the appellant in this Court often consider that it is sufficient to justify the grant of leave under rule 4 that an affidavit is placed before the Court from trial counsel to the effect that, as best as counsel can recall, there was no tactical reason for the failure to take the point. Often trial counsel admits that he or she never thought to take the objection, or was unaware that a direction or warning, such as that raised on appeal, was required. Frequently the material simply indicates that counsel can no longer recall why he or she did not seek the direction or take the objection that is the subject of the ground of appeal. 
      
       
     59    It seems timely to repeat again what Hunt J had to say in R v Abusafiah (1991) 24 NSWLR 531 at 536: 
      
       
        
         
         ""The requirements of r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules do not constitute some mere technicality which may simply be brushed aside. One purpose of the requirement that no misdirection or nondirection may without leave be allowed as a ground of appeal unless objection was taken at the trial is to ensure that the trial judge receives the assistance from counsel to which he or she is entitled in the task of giving appropriate directions to the jury. If a summing-up contains some error which could easily have been cured once the judge's attention had been drawn to it and if counsel for the accused to whose detriment the error fails to comply with his or her duties to draw the judge's attention to that error, any suggestion that such detriment automatically entitles the accused to a new trial does not strike a sympathetic chord in the hearts of those who see the right to a fair trial as operating in favour not only of the accused but also of the Crown which prosecutes on behalf of the whole community. The Criminal Appeal Act 1912 does not exist to enable an accused who has been convicted under one set of issues to have a new trial under a new set of issues which he could and should have raised at the first trial.""  
         
        
       
     60    It may well be the case that, if the failure to seek a direction or warning was a result of a considered and competent decision made for tactical reasons, it would be virtually impossible for the appellant to obtain leave to rely upon the point because no miscarriage of justice could have occurred. But in my view it should not be taken to be the case that leave will automatically be granted simply because the proffered explanation is that counsel overlooked the point or was unaware of the law on the subject. Nor is it more likely that leave will be granted simply because counsel can no longer indicate why the point was not taken at the trial. 
      
       
     61    Nor can bald assertions by trial counsel that there was no tactical reason for a failure to take the point always be taken at face value. This is not to suggest that trial counsel would seek to mislead this Court, but counsel cannot be expected, many months after the event, to recall accurately the atmosphere of the trial or the circumstances in which decisions were made during the course of it. Tactical choices are often made on the spur of the moment as the trial takes on a certain complexion, for example, because of a change in the evidence in the Crown case. 
      
       
     62    Indeed, in light of the experience of this Court over the last ten years, of which the instant case is a good example, a real question arises as to whether the Court should any longer expect an appellant, seeking to overcome the impact of rule 4, to provide an explanation from trial counsel as to why the relevant objection was not taken or the relevant direction not sought. There may be rare occasions when real assistance can be derived from such material in amplification of the transcript. But generally speaking it seems to me to amount to no more than an imposition on trial counsel for little, or no, good purpose. 
      
       
     63    At the end of the day the question, with which this Court is concerned, is whether the conduct of the trial may have resulted in a miscarriage of justice and that question is not necessarily answered in favour of the appellant simply because of decisions, errors or oversights by counsel falling short of incompetence. Trial counsel has a duty both to the client and the Court to take objections or seek re-directions where appropriate: R v Roberts [2001] NSWCCA 163. Like other aspects of the conduct of defence counsel during the course of the trial, a failure to seek a direction or warning will not necessarily result in a miscarriage of justice, even if counsel was negligent: R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 685. If leave is required under rule 4, then the applicant has to persuade this court that a miscarriage of justice may have occurred before leave is granted: Tripodina and Morabito (1988) 35 A Crim R 183 at 191; R v Williamson and Morrell (NSWCCA, 11 October 1991). On the other hand, if the point is taken at trial, the Crown will have the onus of persuading this Court that there had been no substantial miscarriage of justice: Clarke (1995) 78 A Crim R 226. 
      
       
     64    The present appeal is a good example of the way that those acting for appellants often deal with rule 4. At the hearing of the appeal, an affidavit sworn by counsel for the defence at the trial was tendered in relation to his failure to seek any direction on the matter of lies. The affidavit contains the following paragraphs: 
      
       
        
         
          
         “3. I have not had access to the transcript of the trial or my notes of the trial in preparing this affidavit. I am relying on my memory of the trial. 
          
          
         4. In relation to defence exhibit 1, which I recall was a document referring to the appellant’s car windows being tinted, I say that it was my intention to ask the trial judge for a direction on lies and the use the jury could make of that exhibit. If the transcript discloses that I did not make that application, then I say that was an oversight on my part. I have no explanation as to why I did not seek that direction.” 
         
        
       
     65    The content of the affidavit discloses the limited value, if any, that could be placed on that document by this Court. For example, it is not made clear just what direction on lies counsel intended to seek. But, as is apparent from the portion of the transcript I have extracted above, trial counsel did ask for a direction on lies in accordance with Edwards, but abandoned that request in light of the fact that the trial judge was not going to suggest to the jury that any lies told by the accused in relation to Exhibit 1 or otherwise could be used by the jury as evidence of his guilt. In all of the circumstances, that may have appeared to counsel at the trial to be a better result than he might have expected at the close of the evidence. 
      
       
     66    When the Court pointed out the passage in the transcript to counsel for the appellant, he sought leave to file further material on the subject from defence counsel. The Court granted leave as it was intending to reserve its decision. Further material was placed before the Court in the form of answers by counsel to specific questions asked of him by the solicitor for the applicant. It is obvious that counsel has no clear memory of what motivated him to seek a direction on lies and he is apparently doing his best now to recall what happened at the trial, what decisions he made and the reasons for them. From the questions asked of him and the answers given by counsel, the following can be stated: counsel was seeking a direction on lies with respect to Exhibit 1; that direction was in relation to how the jury could use the evidence of lies; counsel cannot recall why he did not seek any further direction in respect of that matter; he does not believe that he was aware of the decision in Zoneff at the time of the trial; he did not make any deliberate decision (which he now recalls) to refrain from seeking a direction on Exhibit 1. 
      
       
     67    This material does not in my view advance the applicant’s case. Nor does it displace the inference that arises strongly from the transcript, that it was a deliberate decision of counsel to have nothing said about the use which the jury could make of lies told by the applicant in respect of Exhibit 1. Although counsel believes he was unaware of Zoneff, two comments can be made about that assertion. Firstly, defence counsel is very experienced and practices extensively in the criminal law. It is difficult to accept that he would not have been aware of a decision of the High Court delivered in May 2000 some ten months before the trial. Secondly, the decision of the High Court did not lay down any new principle of law or identify any new warning necessary to ensure the fair trial of an accused. This is not to underestimate its importance in raising an awareness of the importance of ensuring that lies are not misused by a jury. But even prior to Zoneff, experienced defence counsel would have been aware that, if requested to do so, a trial judge would be expected to warn a jury that they could not find the accused guilty simply because they disbelieved an alibi raised at the trial: R v Visser (NSWCCA, 29 July 1994); R v Steeden (NSWCCA, 19 August 1994); R v GJH [2001] NSWCCA 128; cf R v Small (NSWCCA, 15 April 1994). Such a situation is analogous to that in the present case. 
      
       
     68    Counsel for the appellant has relied in support of this ground upon the decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal in Dat Tuan Nguyen (2001) 118 A Crim R 479. It is unnecessary to refer to that case in any great detail because the factual basis upon which that Court was called upon to consider the directions on lies given by the trial judge were so different from the present case. In Nguyen the post-offence conduct by the accused, which included both lies and the suppression of evidence, was critical to the Crown’s case in order to prove that the shooting by the accused was an intentional act of murder. Although the trial judge ruled that the evidence could not be relied upon to show a consciousness of guilt, during its address the Crown asked the jury to infer from his post-offence conduct that the accused had the murderous intention at the time of the shooting of the deceased. Despite the way in which the Crown sought to rely upon the evidence, the trial judge directed the jury that it went only to the accused’s credit. However, the trial judge did tell the jury that they could not reason from those lies to a finding of guilt. 
      
       
     69    On appeal it was submitted that the directions on lies were inadequate, notwithstanding that trial counsel did not seek any further direction. The Court of Appeal, referring to Zoneff, held that the directions were inadequate in light of the use made by the prosecution of the post-offence evidence in proof of the intention of the accused. It was held that the trial judge had failed to adequately assist the jury in the use to be made of the lies in the context of the issues raised before them and the strong reliance placed upon the evidence by the Crown to prove the guilt of the accused see at [22], [37], [87]-[88]. In particular, it was held that the trial judge should have informed the jury that there might be other explanations to account for the conduct of the accused after the shooting other than that put forward by the Crown. 
      
       
     70    It seems to me to be necessary to quote only one passage from one of judgment given by the members of the Court of Appeal and I do so because it appears to have as much relevance to trial judges in this State as it did to judges in Victoria. In the course of his judgment Winneke P stated (at 488): 
      
       
        
         
         [19]  
         I would have little doubt that in directing the jury as he did -- thereby steering clear of the pejorative term ""lies told out of a consciousness of guilt"" -- his Honour was intending to give directions favourable to the applicant. It is a practice not uncommonly followed by trial judges in this State. In most cases, particularly those where the alleged lies are claimed to have been told in court, a direction to the jury of the kind given by the judge in this case will be adequate. Lies told by an accused person, whether in or out of court, will generally not be probative of guilt but only go to his or her credit. It is only in those cases where they are capable of being used to demonstrate a realisation or consciousness of guilt of the crime charged that they acquire a probative value. But each case must depend upon its own facts, and a ritual adherence to the practice of telling juries that lies can only be used in assessing credibility may expose the accused to a risk of injustice which the judge's charge is designed to avoid. 
         
        
       
     71    In my view Nguyen makes it clear, as does Zoneff, that what direction is necessary will depend upon the issues raised in the particular case, and the purpose to which the use of lies is made, if any, by the Crown. The trial judge must ensure a fair trial of the accused and must give such directions as are necessary to bring about that result. Similarly in R v Galea [2001] NSWCCA 270, the Crown had used the post-offence conduct of the accused as part of its circumstantial case to prove the charge. The trial judge referred to the Crown’s submission to this effect but gave the jury no direction at all in relation to that evidence. This Court held that the summing up was on that basis defective. At the end of the day much will depend upon the significance given to the evidence of the lies by the trial judge during the summing up as reflecting the emphasis placed upon them in the trial; see R v Dhanhoa [2001] NSWCCA 293. 
      
       
     72    The situation in the present case is similar to that which was considered by the High Court in Osland v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 316. In that case the appellant had carried out post-offence deceptive conduct to give the impression that the deceased, her husband, had disappeared when she knew that he was dead. The Crown did not rely upon that evidence as giving rise to a consciousness of guilt and, therefore, the trial judge did not indicate to the jury that they might use her conduct as evidence of her guilt nor did he gave an Edwards direction. Gaudron and Gummow JJ said about this matter: 
      
       
        
         
         [43] 
           
         Although the jury was not instructed that Mrs Osland's lies might be evidence of her consciousness of guilt, there was a real risk that it might reason that, because she lied about her husband's disappearance, she must have known he had been the victim of premeditated murder. Indeed, the prosecution suggested as much, inviting the jury to find that her conduct was not that ""of a person who had killed somebody with lawful justification or excuse."" 
         
        
        
         
         [44] Where, as here, there is a risk that a jury might treat lies as evidence of guilt, the preferable course is for the trial judge to ascertain precisely what use the prosecution contends may be made of the evidence in question. And if the evidence is to be left to the jury as evidence of guilt, it should be instructed as required by Edwards v The Queen. If not, it should be instructed that the evidence is relevant only to the credit of the accused. Only by adopting that course can a trial judge guard against ""a perceptible risk of injustice"".  
         
        
        
         
         [45] 
           
         Although it is not necessary to express a view on the matter, it is difficult, if not impossible, to conclude that the trial judge's failure to follow the course indicated above could have resulted in a miscarriage of justice in this case. Counsel for Mrs Osland did not seek any clarification as to the use that might be made of the evidence of Mrs Osland's conduct. And she sought no direction with respect to it. It is difficult to resist the inference that she took the view that there was nothing to be gained by raising the matter.  
         
        
       
     73    In the present case, the trial judge could well have given a warning such as that which is now sought and would probably have been expected to have done so had one been requested. But I am not persuaded that the failure to give such a warning in the circumstances of this case and in the absence of a request from counsel has resulted in the possibility of a miscarriage of justice. Trial counsel evidently was content that the summing up appropriately and fairly placed the real issue before the jury. Anything more said by his Honour about Exhibit 1 or the appellant’s evidence in relation to it may well have distracted the jury from a proper consideration of that issue to the disadvantage of the appellant. I am of the opinion that leave under rule 4 should be refused. 
      
       
     74    I propose that the appeal be dismissed. 
      
       
     75    CARRUTHERS AJ: I agree with Howie J. In particular I endorse the views of his Honour expressed in paragraph 62 in relation to the provision to this Court of affidavits by trial counsel.

       REGINA v Henry Kendall DUNLOP 
        
        
       Judgment 
       
     1 WOOD CJ AT CL: this is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to S 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 in respect of a sentence imposed by his Honour Justice Blanch CJ of the District Court upon the respondent on 11 April 2001, following his pleas of guilty to one count of dangerous driving causing death, and to one count of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm, in both cases at a time when he was under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Those pleas had been offered in the Local Court, and they were accepted as having been made at the earliest practical opportunity. 
     2 The sentence imposed in respect of each count was one of imprisonment for three years from 11 April 2001, with non-parole periods in each case of twelve months to date from the same date. Such sentences were directed to be served by way of periodic detention commencing on Friday 20 April 2001. The statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence, was varied, his Honour said, because in the ordinary course of events, were the respondent to serve that sentence on a full-time basis, he would need extra supervision and support, coming from the background that he did, and going into a prison situation that he would have to go into. 
     3 To that reason I will return, since I have some difficulty in understanding how it could logically have provided the basis for a finding of special circumstances where the sentence imposed was not one involving full time detention. 
     4 The facts giving rise to the offences were the subject of an agreed statement which was accepted by his Honour, and which was in the following terms: 
      
       
       “Both charges arose from a motor vehicle collision which occurred at approximately 9.20am on Sunday 25 June 2000 on the Jugiong Road via Harden. The prisoner is twenty-one years of age (DOB 15/6/79) and has no prior criminal history. At the time of the collision he was living and working as a horse trainer at the Garangula Polo Club which is located 19 kilometres south of Harden. 
       
       
       During the evening and night of Saturday/Sunday 24 and 25 June 2000, the prisoner was drinking alcohol with friends at the Harden Rugby club, a local hotel and finally at the home of Mr. Jamie Parker. He was awake until approximately 3.00-3.30am and was described as being ‘drunk but not blind drunk’. He had previously made arrangements for his motor vehicle (a white Holden Commodore utility registration number VDX238) to be left at the home of Mr Christopher Johnson which ensured that he would not be driving after he finished drinking. 
       
       
       The prisoner slept at the home of Mr Parker for approximately five to six hours during which time he awoke and had a brief meal. 
       
       
       Sometime prior to 9.20 am the prisoner was driven by Mr John Parker to pick up his vehicle from Mr. Johnson’s home. At Mr. Johnson’s home he ate an apple and then, after driving Mr. Parker to his home, drove to work. He was described at this time as appearing to be ‘allright’. 
       
       
       The total distance to be travelled by the prisoner that morning was approximately 20 kilometres. 
       
       
       At about 9.20am the prisoner was driving south on the Jugiong Road some 3.6 kilometres from Harden approaching four mile creek bridge. There was a down hill gradient and a slight left curve. The prisoner’s vehicle drifted into the northbound lane. At that time Luke Weston, with a passenger Zain Pearce (the deceased), was driving a red Holden Kingswood utility (registration number NSY288) in a northerly direction. Mr. Weston attempted to avoid a collision by swerving into the southbound lane whereupon Mr Dunlop swerved back into that lane. There was a collision between the front and front near side of both vehicles. The point of impact was about one meter from the centre lane in the southbound lane. 
       
       
       It is probable that the prisoner fell asleep causing his vehicle to drift into the northbound lane. At the time of the collision visibility was good, the road was dry and in good condition and the traffic was very light. There is no evidence to suggest that prior to the collision the prisoner 
       
       
       (i) was driving at an excessive speed or in an erratic manner;  
       
       
       (ii) had any warning of falling asleep;  
       
       
       (iii) ignored any warning;  
       
       
       (iv) was engaged in competitive driving or showing off, or  
       
       
       (v) had abandoned responsibility for his conduct. 
       
       
       The prisoner was seriously injured in the accident and has no memory of the events immediately prior to or after the collision. The prisoner was however observed, in an injured state, to be doing all within his power to rescue and assist the occupants of the other vehicle. He sustained additional injuries during the rescue attempts 
       
       
       The prisoner was taken by ambulance to Harden hospital and transferred to Woden hospital in Canberra. At 12.45pm a blood sample was taken which when analysed revealed 0.119 grams of ethyl alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. At the time of the collision it is estimated that the alcohol level would have been not less than 0.126 grams per 100 millilitres of blood.” 
       
     5 It may be noted that the passenger who lost his life and who was trapped in Mr. Weston’s vehicle was an eleven-year-old boy, and that Mr. Weston suffered significant injuries in the accident, including a fractured sternum and a fractured pelvis. 
     6 The respondent also suffered several injuries including a fractured sternum, severe bruising from the seat belt, and lacerations to his face, knee, forehead, eyebrow and chin, as well as burns to his left hand and wrist sustained when attempting to extinguish the fire in the vehicle of Mr. Weston. 
     7 In sentencing the respondent, his Honour made reference to his prior clear record (save for some minor traffic matters) and to the significant number of references from his family and from people in the community who knew and worked with him, which had been tendered and which established that he was a person of excellent character. His Honour concluded, and the Crown does not seek to contravert this finding, that his subjective features were “as good as they could be”. 
     8 The respondent was in fact twenty-one years of age at the time of the offences, and came from a respectable farming family with whom he had a good relationship. He had worked as a stockman in Northern Queensland and was employed, at the time of the offence, as a horse trainer at a polo club near Harden. He had been assessed as very remorseful for the offences, and to not have had a problem with alcohol or drugs, the offence on this occasion involving an over indulgence on a social occasion, which was not usual for him.  
     9 As a result of the destruction of the two vehicles involved in the accident, the respondent accepted a liability to repay to the financier of his vehicle and to the insurer of the other vehicle, a sum in the order of $28,000. Additionally, he was disqualified from driving for three years. 
     10 The Crown submitted that, having regard to the guideline judgment in R v Jurisic 45 NSWLR 19 and subsequent decisions, the sentences imposed were manifestly lenient. In particular, it submitted that: 
      
       
      a) his Honour’s assessment of the objective criminality of the respondent was “inappropriately benign” in that it strained credulity to suggest that a person whose blood alcohol concentration was over twice the limit could be unaware that he was not in a fit state to drive. 
       
       
      b) the sentences did not reflect the objective seriousness of offences involving the death of one person, and the serious injury of another; 
       
       
      c) the sentences did not convey the element of general deterrence which is of considerable importance in relation to the subject offences; 
       
       
      d) his Honour gave undue weight to the subjective features of the respondent, and 
       
       
      e) the direction that the sentences be served by way of periodic detention was inappropriate, by reason of the leniency built into such a direction. 
       
     11 In reply the respondent submitted that: 
      
       
      a) his Honour did not overlook the need for the sentences to have a deterrent effect, or the need to denounce the antisocial conduct involved in driving a vehicle while under the influence, each having been expressly mentioned his Honour; 
       
       
      b) the suggestion that there had been an abandonment of responsibility by the respondent was contradicted by the concession in the agreed statement of facts, and by the evidence showing that the respondent had earlier in the evening parked his car elsewhere, to ensure that he would not drive, had ceased drinking by about 3am, and had thereafter consumed a meal and slept for five to six hours, before returning to his car. Rather, it was submitted, his error was one of misjudgement as to whether or not he was still affected, and in a fit state to drive; 
       
       
      c) the wider sentencing discretion available to his Honour, in a case where there had not been present an abandonment of responsibility, did not miscarry, having regard to the respondent’s very favourable subjective circumstances and to the fact that he was required to serve a sentence involving periodic detention, and had otherwise suffered a personal financial penalty; 
       
       
      d) in the event of the Court being satisfied that his Honour erred, then it should not, in the exercise of its discretion, intervene by reason of the concession made by the Crown, in the agreed facts, that this was not a case involving an abandonment of responsibility, and by reason of the fact that the respondent has now served almost half of the non-parole period to which his sentence was subject, having progressed to the second stage of the periodic detention programme. 
       
     12 The maximum available sentences for the offences here involved were imprisonment for ten years and seven years respectively (s 52A(1)(a) and s 52A(3)(a) Crimes Act (NSW) 1900. 
     13 In Jurisic Spigelman CJ promulgated the following guidelines for an offence against s 52A of the Crimes Act: 
      
       
       “1. A non-custodial sentence for an offence against s 52A should be exceptional and almost invariably confined to cases involving momentary inattention or mis-judgment. 
       
       
       2. With a plea of guilty, wherever there is present to a material degree any aggravating factor involving the conduct of the offender, a custodial sentence (minimum plus additional or fixed term) of less than three years (in the case of dangerous driving causing death) and less than two years (in the case of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm) should be exceptional. 
       
     14 The factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence, his Honour observed, included the following: 
      
       
       “(i) extent and nature of the injuries inflicted; 
        
       (ii) number of people put at risk; 
        
       (iii) degree of speed; 
        
       (iv) degree of intoxication or of substance abuse; 
        
       (v) erratic driving; 
        
       (vi) Length of the journey during which others were exposed to risk; 
        
       (viii) Ignoring of warnings; 
        
       (x) Escaping police pursuit.” 
       
     15 His honour added, in relation to the guideline, that: 
      
       
       “The period of three or two years, once the threshold of  
       abandoning responsibility 
        has been reached, is a starting point. The presence of additional aggravating factors, or their increased intensity, will determine the actual sentence”. 
       
     16 Earlier in the course of his judgment Spigelman CJ cited with approval the comments of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Musemici NSW CCA 30 October 1997 (at 4-5) as follows: 
      
       
       “This Court has held that a number of considerations which had to be taken into account when sentencing for culpable driving must also be taken into account when sentencing for this new offence of dangerous driving. 
       
       
       1. The legislature has always placed a premium upon human life, and the taking of a human life by driving a motor vehicle dangerously is to be regarded as a crime of some seriousness. 
       
       
       2. The real substance of the offence is not just the dangerous driving; it is the dangerous driving in association with the taking of a human life. 
       
       
       3. Such is the need for public deterrence in this type of case, the youth of any offender is given less weight as a subjective matter than in other types of cases. 
        
       4. The courts must tread warily in showing leniency for good character in such cases. 
       
       
       5. So for youthful offenders of good character, who are guilty of dangerous driving, therefore, the sentence must be seen to have a reasonable proportionality to the objective circumstances of the crime, and persuasive subjective circumstances must not lead to inadequate weight being given to those objective circumstances. 
       
       
       6. Periodic detention has a strong element of leniency built into it and, as presently administered, it is usually no more punitive than a community service order. 
       
       
       7. The statement made by this Court in relation to the previous offence of culpable driving – that it cannot be said that a full-time custodial sentence is required in every case – continues to apply in relation to the new offence of dangerous driving. As that offence is committed even though the offender has had no more than a momentary or casual lapse of attention, there must always be room for a non-custodial sentence (although that does  
       not 
        mean that a non-custodial sentence is ordinarily appropriate in such a case) but the case in which a sentence other than one involving  
       full-time 
        custody is appropriate must be rarer for this new offence.” 
       
     17 Spigelman CJ added that: 
      
       
       “Although said in the context of dangerous driving causing death, his Honour’s comments can be readily adapted to the cognate offence of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm.” 
       
     18 In R v Pyritz NSW CCA 23 November 1998, and in R v Davies (2000) NSWCCA 84, this Court similarly confirmed that non-custodial sentences, in the present context, are almost invariably to be confined to cases involving momentary attention or misjudgement. The consistent approval of the proposition is not to be diluted or circumvented by the presence of strong subjective circumstances, or otherwise. 
     19 Unfortunately, it is the case that serious motoring offences, which result in death or serious bodily injury to others, are very often committed by young males with impeccable subjective circumstances, and for whom the consequences psychologically and otherwise, are extreme. That was a circumstance recognized both in Jurisic and Musemici.  
     20 It was a theme also taken up by Spigelman CJ in Howland (1999) 104 A Crim R 273, where (at 279) his Honour observed that there had been error in the part of the sentencing Judge in two respects: 
      
       
       “First, by failing to give appropriate weight to the objective seriousness of the offence as reflected in the maximum penalty; secondly, by failing to give weight to the need for general deterrence – the deterrence to others from engaging in irresponsible conduct that so often results in death or serious injury. 
        
       As to the first error, the community has indicated that it wishes to denounce this conduct in the strongest terms. The premium on human life which our society accepts as a fundamental value is such that culpable conduct which kills must be treated as a serious crime. By the increases in the maximum sentences, the community, acting through the Parliament, has indicated that this is a crime, which it wishes to denounce and deter. It is the duty of the judges to reflect this community concern. 
       
       
       The second factor is the need to deter others from engaging in the conduct, which might lead to the commission of this offence. Judge Job made no express reference to this factor. There is, and has been for many years, a debate as to the deterrence value of imprisonment. Judges will differ in their opinions with respect to this matter. It is perfectly appropriate for sentencing to vary, within reasonable bounds, to reflect such differences of opinion, being differences which judges share with members of the community as a whole The emphasis, however, is on the reasonable bounds. 
       
       
       Sentencing has always been based on the acceptance of the proposition that condign punishment of offenders will have a deterrent effect on others. 
       
       
       In order to have this deterrent effect, sentencing practice of the Courts must reflect a consistency in approach. That is what this Court sought to achieve in  
       Jurisic 
       . This is an offence most often committed by young men. Young men in our community must understand that if you drive dangerously and kill someone, you will go to gaol. 
       
       
       In my opinion, a period of imprisonment was the only appropriate penalty for this offence.” 
       
     21 That was a case in which the dangerous conduct involved the respondent driving a truck deliberately through a red light as a result of which he struck and killed a motorcyclist, and in which a sentence of periodic detention for eighteen months was held to have been “outside any reasonable exercise of the sentencing discretion” available to the sentencing Judge. It was found not to be a case of momentary inattention or misjudgement. As a result the appeal was allowed and a sentence comprising a minimum term of nine months and an additional term of nine months was substituted. It may be observed additionally that it was a case where the respondent was denied the benefit of a plea of guilty, but it was also one where, consistently with the double jeopardy principle noted in Rose NSWCCA 23 May 1996, the substituted sentence was one which the court considered was “the least sentence that could properly have been imposed at first instance.” 
     22 As Spigelman CJ anticipated in Jurisic at 231, the formulation of the guideline which, in individual cases, was likely to hinge on the question whether there had been an abandonment by the offender of responsibility for his or her conduct, introduced “an element of judgment on which reasonable minds may differ”. So it has been the case that sentencing Judges, and this Court, have had to deal with that question on a regular basis. 
     23 The present case was somewhat unique having regard to the concessions which had been made in the agreed statement, which tended to ameliorate the significance of the single aggravating factor of alcohol that was present. It was upon the basis of this point that the Crown appeal substantially turned, in that, upon its case the high alcohol level still in the respondent’s blood on the morning of the accident, meant that this circumstance of aggravation should have been found to have been present, to a material extent. 
     24 Upon the respondent’s case, however, it was suggested that so far as the Crown sought to argue this point at trial, he had been lulled into a false sense of security, which was shared by the trial judge, in assuming that there was no point in him giving evidence. Had he done so then, although it cannot now be known with any certainty what he would have said, it is likely, in view of his earlier responsible behaviour, and the evidence of the person whom he had driven home, and who said that he “seemed fine”, that he would have a similar assessment of his condition.  
     25 Whatever be the case, there was no obvious reason for him to give evidence as to how he felt, or to explain what his understanding was, if any, as to the time needed for his blood/alcohol level to reduce to a point where it was safe to drive. This is particularly so having regard to the fact that at one point, there was a discussion between his Counsel and Blanch J, which resulted in an apparent consensus that there was little to be achieved by calling him as a witness. 
     26 I am not persuaded in the very special circumstances outlined, that this Court should come to any view different from his Honour in relation to the question whether or not there was an abandonment of responsibility. It is true that a sentencing Judge is bound to find the facts for himself, and is not necessarily bound to any concession contained, in an agreed statement of facts. However, the existence of such a concession is not to be ignored, since a person facing sentence is entitled to take it into account when electing whether or not to call evidence. Moreover, it may be assumed that when the facts are placed before a Sentencing Court by the Crown, care will have been taken to ensure that they are correct. Unless it is shown on appeal that any concession by the Crown and any finding of the Sentencing Judge based upon it, was not something that was open upon the evidence, then this Court should, in my view, be slow to come to any other view. 
     27 His Honour accepted that the case was one where notwithstanding the precautions, which had been taken, the respondent had driven while he was still affected by the alcohol, which he had earlier consumed, and one where there had been tragic consequences. He made specific reference to R v King (2001) NSWCCA 18, where this Court had upheld a Crown appeal against periodic detention in respect of an offence of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm, and had substituted a sentence of imprisonment for two years with a non-parole period of one year. It was a case where the respondent had consumed a good deal of alcohol the preceding day, before going to work, and had then consumed two stubbies and two middies of beer after finishing his night shift and before driving home. His blood alcohol concentration, measured an hour after the accident was particularly high, being .273 gams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. The accident had occurred when he bent down to pick up a lighted cigarette which he had dropped, while driving over a narrow bridge, resulting him striking the kerb and rebounding into the path of another vehicle. He had two prior convictions for mid range PCA offences and was aged 34 years at the time of the offence, with an otherwise good life history. He had pleaded guilty to the offence and had voluntarily undertaken a course of alcohol rehabilitation. 
     28 It was held that the sentencing Judge had erred in treating the case as one of momentary inattention, having regard to the amount of alcohol which the respondent had consumed and, to the fact that he had resumed drinking immediately before he set off to drive 15 kms. or so to his home, as well as to his admission that he had been feeling “fairly tired” at the time. Sheller JA with whom Grove and Kirby JJ agreed, said: 
      
       
        
        “the respondent in setting out to drive home and continuing on his way with a concentration of alcohol well above the lower limit of the high range and while tired, had undertaken quite deliberately and recklessly a dangerous enterprise. 
        
       
     29 Although recognising that this case had some similarities, Blanch J distinguished it upon the basis of the earlier history of drink driving and the high level blood alcohol reading, which, as I have observed, was at least partly attributed by to the fact that he had resumed drinking immediately before commencing his journey home. These were, in my view, appropriately regarded as distinguishing circumstances. 
     30 One other decision of this Court where a sentence of periodic detention was set aside, deserves mention. That was the decision in Khatter (2000) NSWCCA 32, where the majority (Sully J and Carruthers AJ, Simpson J dissenting) considered it necessary to set aside a sentence of imprisonment for two years to be served by way of periodic detention, upon a Crown appeal, and substitutes one involving a fixed term of three months. Although Sully J considered that the sentence, which should have been imposed at first instance, was one of imprisonment for two years, the lesser sentence was imposed by reason of the constraints, relevant for Crown appeals, and by reason of the fact that the respondent had already performed, in part, the periodic detention order. 
     31 That case was one involving the death of a passenger in a motor vehicle driven by the respondent at a speed twenty to thirty kilometres in excess of the speed limit, at a time when his blood alcohol concentration was between 0.09 and 0.105 gms per 100 ml. The accident occurred when the respondent lost control while rounding a bend. He had an impeccable prior record, and pleaded guilty to the offence of dangerous driving causing death. It was not his usual habit to drink to excess, but this was an occasion when he had done so in the course of discussing with the deceased, the unhappiness of the latter after having immigrated to Australia. He had been prevailed upon by the deceased to drive, and had in fact missed the bend where the accident occurred, while reaching over with one arm in an effort to comfort him. 
     32 While Simpson J dissented from the majority judgment, she did find a number of errors in the approach taken by the sentencing Judge, including the absence of any specific reason for diverging from the sentencing range stated in Jurisic, the view which his Honour had expressed that there was no benefit to society in sentencing the respondent to a term of full time custody, his apparent reliance on pre-Jurisic statistics, and his assessment that the case leant more towards momentary inattention than it did to a sustained course of outrageous driving. It was by reference to the unusual circumstances of the respondent, including some favourable post offence circumstances, and the residual discretion, that Simpson J thought it appropriate to dismiss the appeal. 
     33 One observation of her Honour which was not questioned in the majority judgment is pertinent, so far as it related to the objective culpability of the respondent. It was in the following terms: 
      
       
        
        “I do not accept the Crown’s contention that the fact of the blood alcohol level means that this was a case in which the respondent had abandoned responsibility for his behaviour. These courts deal with human beings, with all their human weaknesses, and while the courts cannot condone any act of driving whilst there is present in the blood more than the prescribed concentration of alcohol, it is not necessary to characterise every instance of the offence as an abandonment of personal responsibility. Offences under s 52A are not divided into those of momentary inattention and those of abandonment of responsibility. Those are the two extremes. There are shades and gradations of moral culpability in different instances of the offence and it is proper for the courts to recognise a continuum, rather than a dichotomy, when assessing moral culpability. This was the approach taken by the Chief Justice in  
        R v Howland 
         (1999) NSWCCA 10; 104 A Crim R 273. The circumstances in which the respondent came to be driving after consuming alcohol should not be overlooked. He did not anticipate driving when he was drinking, and he initially resisted the request to drive, recognising that he should not do so. These were very unusual circumstances and very relevant to a proper evaluation of his moral culpability.” 
        
       
     34 This passage appears to me to have a sound practical basis. It is somewhat artificial, and in a case such as the present, next to impossible to detect a distinct line between abandonment of responsibility and momentary inattention. 
     35 To similar effect, I believe was the assessment of Sully J, that while it would not have been fair to assess the respondent’s moral culpability in terms of a “simple and comprehensive abandonment of his personal responsibility” as a motorist, nevertheless his election to drive a vehicle on a public street when he realised that he was not in a fit state do so, involved “a real degree of moral culpability”. That, his Honour said, while properly attracting “sentencing distinctly towards the lower point of the relevant proper sentencing range”, nevertheless required that it be of a full time custodial kind. To do otherwise, his Honour said, would give to the subjective features, real and compelling though they undoubtedly were, disproportionate weight in relation to the relevant objective facts. 
     36 In the present case, it appears that the immediate cause of the accident was the fact that the respondent drifted off to sleep. That cannot be divorced from the circumstance that he did so because of the alcohol he had consumed until the early hours of the morning. While taking the wheel of his vehicle did not involve a deliberate and reckless decision to drive while intoxicated, and therefore did not amount to a conscious or irresponsible abandonment of responsibility, his moral culpability remained high in driving with a significant blood alcohol range. The fact that he had earlier taken steps not to drive while drinking did not materially detract from or qualify that circumstance. 
     37 The primary submission of Senior Counsel for the respondent rested upon the proposition that the offences were not the result of an abandonment of responsibility and that as a consequence error had not been demonstrated. Mr. Byrnes SC properly accepted that it is not only where there is an abandonment of responsibility that a sentence of full time custody is justified. In such a case, however, he submitted, correctly in my view, that the sentencing discretion is widened.  
     38 This approach is consistent with that adopted in Regina v Foster (2001) NSWCCA 215. Moreover, it accords with the observations made by Spigelman CJ in clarification of the guideline, in Tadman (2001) NSWCCA 225: 
      
       
       “The passage in  
       Jurisic 
        in which the guideline was set out did not distinguish between a minimum appropriate punishment, on the one hand, and aggravating factors, on the other. Indeed, it was only the presence of aggravating factors ”to a material degree”, which reached the level where it could be said that the offender abandoned responsibility for his or her own conduct, that the guideline indicated that a total sentence of less than three years should be regarded as exceptional. I went on to note in  
       Jurisic 
        at 231G, that once the threshold of abandoning responsibility had been reached, a period of three years should be regarded as a starting point but the presence of additional aggravating factors or the heightened intensity of any of the specific aggravating factors already taken into account ‘will determine the actual sentence.’ 
       
     39 As the decisions earlier noted make crystal clear, there are degrees of moral culpability involved in these offences, such that in a proper case a custodial sentence may still be called for, even though the case does not involve any deliberate abandonment of responsibility. 
     40 Of relevance in this regard, so far as the present case is concerned, is the observation in Tadman (2001) NSWCCA 225, that there is no need for the Crown to present evidence, in a case involving the consumption of drugs or alcohol, to show the offender’s awareness that his driving capacity was as severely impaired as it in fact was. Spigelman CJ there observed: 
      
       
       “… There was no need for any such evidence. When a person takes a drug like heroin, or indeed alcohol, the Court will infer that he or she understood that his or her ability to drive will be impaired. If an accused wishes to contest this obvious inference, it will be up to the accused to give evidence to that effect. See  
       R v Comber 
        (NSWCCA 11 November 1998 reported).” 
       
     41 It appears to me that his Honour read too much into the concession, and as a consequence failed to properly assess the extent of the respondent’s culpability on the continuum between misjudgement and inadvertence at one end of the scale, and the point where there is abandonment of responsibility, such as to attract a guideline sentence. 
     42 The respondent’s conduct was morally serious. It involved more than momentary inattention or misjudgement in the sense which I take the latter expression to have been used in Jurisic, ie a misjudgement in the manner in which a vehicle should be controlled or driven. It also cannot be overlooked that there were here two offences arising out of the one and the same incident, in which one young man lost his life and another was seriously injured. Despite his excellent character and strong claim to be a responsible and respected member of the community, this was a case where in my view his Honour should have maintained the strong stand in relation to general deterrence which has been emphasised time and again by this Court by imposing a sentence that had an element of full time detention although one falling short of the guideline. In my view that should have been one in the order of eighteen months imprisonment with a non-parole period of twelve months. 
     43 In this regard, I am persuaded that the trend of authority, and the consistency of sentencing called for in Jurisic, require the conclusion that a sentence of periodic detention in this case was not properly available, by reason of the leniency which is built into such a sentence: Hallocoglu (1992) 63 A Crim R 287. 
     44 To that extent, error of law has been shown, in accordance with the principles expressed by the High Court in House v The King (1936) 63 A Crim R 287. 
     45 Another error of law has, in my view, been shown in relation to the finding of special circumstances. That finding was made by reference to the assumption, which did not become the fact, that there would be a need for a longer period than usual for post release supervision, if the respondent was to serve a sentence involving full time custody. 
     46 Otherwise there was no special reason for him to be supervised or counselled, since he was not shown to have any personality problem, or difficulty with substance abuse. Moreover, he had employment to go to, as well as substantial community ties and support. 
     47 A result of the finding of special circumstances was to produce an inordinately lenient sentence. Since there was no basis for any such finding, the statutory direction contained in S 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act applied, and non parole period should accordingly have been of 2 years and 3 months. Having regard to the period of community service which the respondent had performed in accordance with phase 2 of the administrative management of the periodic detention order, I am of the view that subject to any question of discretion or of double jeopardy, this Court should intervene and increase the non parole period to one of two years. 
     48 This brings me to the question whether the Court should in the exercise of its discretion, and by reference to the principles of double jeopardy noted in Everett v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 295 and Dinsdale (2000) 74 ALJR 1538, intervene. 
     49 It also requires attention to be given to the additional material which has been provided in case the Court thinks it necessary to intervene. That material, I observe, confirms the very favourable reputation which the respondent enjoys in the community. It also establishes that he responded in an admirable fashion to periodic detention, despite the burden which he experienced in travelling to Bathurst each weekend for that purpose. And that he has similarly been highly regarded in relation to his performance of the community service component of the sentence, to which he has now progressed. 
     50 These circumstances, and the concession made by the Crown, which may be properly taken into account when considering this appeal, leads me to the conclusion that, in the exercise of its discretion, the Court should intervene only to the extent of restoring the correct ratio between the non parole period and the head sentence. 
     51 I consider that to intervene to that limited extent, in this somewhat unusual case, would underline the significant element of general deterrence that was otherwise lacking in the sentence, and provide a measure of punishment which more appropriately reflects the moral culpability of the respondent. 
     52 In that regard, as the Court has observed more than once, favourable subjective circumstances, and other circumstances more appropriately taken into account in fixing a head sentence, or in determining how it should be served, should not be used in the guise of special circumstances, so as to reduce the non parole period: Lett NSW CCA 27 March 1995. 
     53 Accordingly, I propose that the appeal be allowed but only to the extent of increasing the non parole period to one of two years to date from 11 April 2001, taking into account, in reducing this period from that of two years and three months previously mentioned, the community service which the respondent has performed. He should be released on parole at the end of the period of two years.

     FRIDAY 16 NOVEMBER 2001 
      
      
      REGINA v. JOSIP BADANJAK 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
      
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 3 September 2001, the offender Josip Badanjak pleaded guilty to the murder of his wife Maria Badanjak. He had been charged that at Blacktown on 24 January 2000 he had murdered his wife by stabbing her to death at the premises at Blacktown the family had owned. He has been in custody since that date, 24 January 2000 and his sentence should date from that date. 
    2 He pleaded guilty on 3 September 2001 following investigation of matters referrable to his mental condition. Those matters are referred to in the report of Dr. Bruce Westmore of 27 September 2001 and in the report of Janet Deblin, consultant psychologist, of 26 June 2001. Dr. Westmore's report discloses that when he saw the offender for re-examination, the offender expressed his sorrow for the death of his wife, that ""it's very heavy on my soul and I'm very sorry for that. I can't bring her back and it is very hard to talk about that"". He had in his history given to that doctor referred to what all the evidence confirms was the tempestuous and at times violent family relationship. In particular, he had referred to his wife's anger because he would not stop drinking and because of the difficulties that presented to the family, not only in terms of the personal relations, but also to money problems. He referred to his alcoholism and to his painful back condition. He referred to his forgetfulness and the observations of him by relatives that when he was drunk he was ""terribly bad"". 
    3 Dr. Westmore referred to a cultural difficulty underlying the relationships between the offender and his wife and the offender and his children. He referred to acute stressors in the relationships, in particular, occasioned by his belief that his wife was acting inappropriately. Dr. Westmore concluded that although on the day in question the offender had shown vicious aggression, that aggression appeared to be specific to the object of the aggression, that is his wife and to the occasion. Dr. Westmore was of the view the man did not represent a danger to the general community. Dr. Westmore did recommend, however, that the offender consider entering sobriety. He concluded that the offender was now aware of the gravity of what he has done and the impact on him and his children. He has been cut off from contact by his children and no longer has access to his grandchildren. This is likely to cause him long-term distress and will mean that he will be entirely abandoned by his family for the future on his release. 
    4 Dr. Westmore had examined the offender in July 2001 initially. He did that for the purpose of ascertaining whether any mental state problem existed which should appropriately be raised at trial or on plea. The history given to Dr. Westmore by the offender except in one matter, that is relating to the suggestion by the offender that the stabbing occurred in self-defence or as a result of having previously been stabbed by his wife in circumstances where she was not defending herself against him, generally accords with the facts as proved before me. Dr. Westmore in the report he gave following that initial examination referred to the offender's admission of having stabbed his wife, ""how many times he could not say"" and that the offence was committed as an acute episode in a context of chronic marital conflict. Dr. Westmore concluded that although there were stressors and suggestions of personality or psychiatric problems, he could find no clear history to indicate that the offender ""was suffering from a major depressive illness prior to this incident"" and further, he concluded there was ""no clear history supportive of the presence of a psychotic disorder"". 
    5 The report from the psychologist recorded that she similarly was of the view that there was no evidence of psychotic illness but she expressed the view that the offender had described long-standing symptoms consistent with a depressive illness, that his presentation seemed odd at times and often incongruent with the seriousness of his predicament and the circumstances which led to the murder. She suggested that he may have incurred head injuries in the numerous work-place accidents the history given to her establishes he had suffered. She suggested there was ""considerable cognitive dysfunction on the basis of his presentation and the neuropsychological screening tests administered"". She attributed this to alcohol related brain damage or a demented illness, though she referred to the possibility of a cerebrovascular accident or some such similar event, given the history of heavy drinking and smoking. She does suggest that there was a degree of behavioural disinhibition due to organic brain damage to be considered in the context of alcoholic disinhibition arising from the admitted substantial ingestion of alcohol by the offender on the day in question. 
    6 In a follow-up report of 16 October she refers to the possibility that the offender's intellect was in the lower than average range of normal functioning and that there had been an impairment arising from a gradual deterioration of intellectual ability over time possibly associated with those factors to which I have shortly earlier referred. 
    7 In that context, the plea to murder was entered. During argument and again before me today the question of whether the offender should be treated for the purpose of considering the utilitarian value of his plea as having entered an early plea was discussed. The Crown wishes to make no submission to suggest that it was not an appropriately early plea since, in cases of murder, such questions as were investigated here should entirely properly be investigated. There was no attempt, apparently at any stage, to put in issue the commission by the accused of the fatal act, what was sought to be investigated was to ascertain his mental state at the relevant time. 
    8 It is submitted on his behalf that he should receive as much as possible of the discount appropriately to be awarded for an early plea and, in addition, some further discount arising from his expressions of remorse and contrition to the psychiatrist to which I have already referred. 
    9 An examination of the reports indicate that there has been over the years some degree of intellectual decline. An examination of the histories taken in conjunction with the offender's prior circumstances discloses an appalling saga of violent ill treatment of his family. That is consistent with the alcoholism, the intellectual decline and increasing cognitive deficits. It may, however, explain the background to the commission of this offence, it does not in any way excuse it. 
    10 In gaol it would appear some greater degree of clarity has been given to the offender's realisation of his own position, no doubt arising from an inability to ingest the quantity of alcohol habitually that he had formerly ingested, but there is that degree of insight that allows him to understand what he has done and to express the remorse for it that he has to the extent at least as the psychiatrist has described. I accept he has some greater degree of insight now than he had and that there is a degree of remorse and sorrow. It is therefore appropriate that I give value to the plea on both of those heads as submitted. 
    11 The appropriate value was the subject of oral submissions and I would accept the submissions that he should be entitled when considering the Regina v. Thompson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 criteria to a discount of 15%. I will in addition take into account his cognitive deficits to some limited extent only, since it appears they have only a limited part to play in depriving him of the controls to be expected of an ordinary person in his circumstances, and will take into account his cultural background for the purpose at least of enabling some understanding to be given to the rage and frustrations he gave in to on this occasion and to the contrition and remorse that he has shown. He expressed the view that his crime was heavy on his soul. He will have a number of years in custody and the rest of his life to reflect upon that matter. 
    12 The short facts of the commission of this offence were set out in an extensive document by way of chronology provided to me as part of a large volume of sentencing materials by the Crown. That volume is Exhibit A. The content of it is not disputed, nor is any matter in it objected to. 
    13 Shortly, the offender was born on 10 May 1948 in Croatia. His wife was some five years younger, similarly born in Croatia. They married there and migrated to Australia in December 1969. The offender taught himself the English language and worked as a carpenter. There are three children of the marriage, Jagoda Rose, Ankica Badanjak and Stjepan Badanjak. About 1978 the offender and the deceased purchased the family home at Lance Crescent, Greystanes. 
    14 On 19 December 1983 the prisoner appeared at Parramatta Local Court in respect of an assault on his wife and received the benefit of a recognisance for 12 months. Three years later, the offender and the deceased separated for approximately 12 months and the offender lived at another address in Merrylands. Subsequently, there have been apprehended domestic violence orders and assault prosecutions of the offender. The apprehended violence order number one, originally granted in February 1989, was extended. A condition was imposed that the offender refrain from alcohol. The relationship was marked by the deceased's wife having to resort to the protection of the court on a number of occasions. It is not necessary to give the details of the various episodes in the extensive history. The children have grown-up during a relationship, which is established to be marked continuously by episodes of drunken violence on the part of offender. 
    15 In about 1992, Jagoda, who is now aged 28, moved out. She has had limited contact with her parents thereafter, though she had resumed contact with her mother prior to her mother's death. 
    16 The tempestuous relationship continued after Jagoda moved out and there was a further apprehended domestic violence order obtained. The offender, who had moved from the home, moved in to premises at 113 Newton Road, Blacktown by agreement with the then tenant, Mr. Kevin Francis, to enable him to live separate and apart from his wife in 1995 to 1996 with his son Stjepan. Then he returned to Croatia for about four months. Stjepan returned to live with his mother. Later, the offender again lived at Newton Road, Stephen returning again to live with him once more. Some six or seven months later he moved back to Bungarribee Road where the deceased was living to share the accommodation with her and once again Mr. Francis resumed his tenancy of the premises at Newton Road, Blacktown. 
    17 In 1998 there was another dispute between the offender and the deceased. Once again the offender moved out. 
    18 In mid-1999, police brought the offender to the Newton Road address because of arguments taking place between the offender and the deceased at Bungarribee Road. 
    19 In May 1989 the police attended the Bungarribee premises as a result of a complaint by the deceased of the offender being intoxicated and behaving in a loud and aggressive manner. The deceased and her daughter had taken refuge in a bedroom. 
    20 In about January 2000 the deceased discussed with Jagoda, her daughter, the possibility of moving out of the Bungarribee Road address and living somewhere else together. The offender and Stephen were not to be part of the move. At that point the deceased informed Jagoda that the offender was not happy with this proposal. 
    21 Jagoda last had contact with the deceased about 3.30 pm on 24 January 2000 by telephone when she could hear the offender's voice in the background saying that coffee should be brought to him. 
    22 At about 4.15 pm on that day the deceased saw her good friend Mila Tirkes. She looked pale and was quiet. She complained of a very heavy headache. 
    23 At about that time, at the Newton Road Blacktown address, Mr. Francis was approached by the offender. The offender referred to his only having had three beers at the pub since there was no-one that he knew. He had a further beer and stayed for about half an hour. Whilst there, he told Mr. Francis that his wife had packed his and his son's clothes as she wanted them out. His son had apparently had some mates around drinking and had given her cause for complaint. He told Mr. Francis that she was going to sell the premises at Bungarribee Road and get a smaller place for herself and Ankica. According to Mr. Francis, the offender then said to him that he intended to go to his home and knife his wife, ""that will sort things out"". He said to Mr. Francis that he had told his wife he could not move in with Mr. Francis and that what he would do is to go to his home and kill his wife and Ankica. Mr. Francis told him not to be stupid, that he would throw his whole life away. Mr. Francis expressed the view that the offender appeared sober ""for once"". 
    24 At 6.25 pm the police emergency 000 service was dialled by the offender who told the receptionist that he had killed his wife and asked the police to attend. On arrival, he was standing at the front door of the premises. He was arrested and participated in due course in an electronically recorded interview. 
    25 During that interview, he admitted he had stabbed the deceased with a kitchen knife that had been found by police on the kitchen bench top. In the interview he indicated that when he entered the premises, the knife was on his wife's lap, that he did not know how ""she stabbed me or she stabbed herself"". He said that he was not drunk but had had maybe just a little alcohol, five beers. He expressed the view that he could not be drunk on five beers. When he entered the premises, his wife was on the telephone sitting on a stool. He stabbed her while she was on the phone. The initial account that he gave was that she grabbed his arm, he grabbed the knife from her lap and thrust it into her ""when she was fighting with me"". He stabbed her, he said he did not know how many times, but it must be possibly in the chest area, that she fell to the ground and that he stabbed her by thrusting the knife into her. His account was to an extent incoherent. 
    26 It appears that Ankica came home shortly after her mother's death, saw her father wiping the blood down the sides of his white woollen jumper and he said to her, ""I just killed your mother. She's dead. I've had enough of her, she's dead"", or words to that effect. There was a suggestion that he had said words to the effect that ""now the rest of you kids are finished. There's going to be no more Badanjaks after me"". 
    27 The medical report disclosed that Mr. Badanjak had sustained some wounds to his arms. Those wounds were consistent with recent stabbing injuries from a hard sharp object. They were not consistent necessarily with his wife stabbing him. They were explicable upon the basis that he may have inflicted injuries on himself in the fight. 
    28 The injuries to his wife were described in the report of Dr. Peter Ellis who referred to a number of stab wounds, in particular, one on the left side of the lower chest wall 1.5 centimetres long extending through the ribs and penetrating the pericardium. There was a second wound close by which extended again through the left fifth rib cartilage, entering the lateral part of the anterior wall of the pericardium and penetrating the right ventricle. Another wound on the left upper anterior chest wall 1.6 centimetres long did not penetrate the rib cartilage. A further wound on the right upper chest wall passed through into deep skeletal muscle, but did not penetrate the chest cavity. A wound on the anterior surface of the right biceps area damaged that arm, but the damage did not extend into the deep tissues. Another wound was both a combination stab and incised wound and that was sustained to the left biceps. There was a further wound to the left forearm and other minor scratches and lacerations. A stab wound, however, was noted on the left lower neck five centimetres long and damaging the left jugular vein. It appears that that wound comprised at least two separate wounds taken together. Two further wounds were found, one on the left upper triceps and one on the posterolateral surface of the left triceps. There was a stab wound behind the right ear. There were wounds consistent with being suffered whilst the deceased was attempting to defend herself. 
    29 It is apparent from that account that there is ample material from which I can conclude and do conclude that the offender in a frenzy occasioned by his anger stabbed his wife numerous times. The evidence does not allow me to say what was the first blow, but the evidence is certainly not inconsistent with the proposition he put to the police and which has been submitted by his counsel as appropriate, that is that he first stabbed her in the throat. 
    30 It has been submitted that I should not conclude that the killing was premeditated. I do not accept that submission. On what he said to Mr. Francis, he plainly did contemplate killing his wife. Whether that intention had entirely crystallised at that time is not clear, but certainly at the time at which he took the knife from his wife, it seems perfectly clear that because of his rage, he had lost self-control and was determined to kill his wife. 
    31 It is accepted that there was no attempt on his part at any time to conceal what he had done. He called the police immediately and it is to those two factors I refer in particular when I confirm that it is appropriate that he be treated on his plea as having the entitlement to the discount to which I have already referred. 
    32 The submission is made that general deterrence should play a less significant role in these circumstances than it otherwise may. I do not see that the offender is suffering from some such substantial condition as would warrant some special mitigation of sentence, which might otherwise be appropriate. I am unable to see in the history of this matter why - the emotional relationship having reached this culmination - there should be some particular mitigation of sentence otherwise appropriate having regard to the requirements of general deterrence and specific deterrence. His prior statement to Mr. Francis and his subsequent statement to his daughter in my view do not operate to aggravate culpability, but do deprive the offender of the opportunity to assert that the killing of his wife and this episode of violence should not be treated as otherwise than coming in the context of the violence that he had inflicted on his spouse on so many occasions during their marriage. 
    33 The Crown does not submit that there should be any particularly marked emphasis in the individual circumstances of this case on personal deterrence. I understand that is a submission that the component of personal deterrence should be given its ordinary weight. I accept that submission. 
    34 In the discussion on sentence, I referred counsel to the decisions in Regina v. Macadam-Kelly [2001] NSWCCA 170 and Regina v. Elphick [2000] NSWSC 977. In those decisions I had regard to the view the Courts have taken of those who kill their spouse for failing to accede to their wishes. I cited the remarks of Allen J in Regina v. Cheung (CCA unreported 11 December 1995) as to a submission that crimes such as this are to be mitigated because the offender has for some personal reason attempted to impose his view of how someone else should live their life upon their victim. In Elphick (supra), I referred to the pattern of sentencing in spouse murder cases at paragraphs 27 and 28 of that judgment. I have regard to those matters here. 
    35 I am of the view that there is limited contest, if any contest, with what is contained in the reports of the psychologist and psychiatrist. Notwithstanding the Crown's submission in reliance on Regina v. Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353, I see nothing in the histories given to those reporting that I would not accept, except for the proposition that there was any element of self-defence or physical provocation giving rise to what the offender in fact did. Not only was there no such matter as would found a defence, but there was no such matter as far as I can see which would have in any way contributed to the offender doing what he did. The suggestion that there was is inconsistent with what he said to Mr. Francis. 
    36 It is apparent that this killing was committed with intent to kill whilst the offender was in a high emotional state, a state which in him, caused him to give vent on this occasion, as it had previously, to his rage by domestic violence, although on this occasion it occasioned violence to a greater extent with the appalling and fatal consequences. What he has done has been to deprive himself of his life's partner and to deprive himself of contact with his children. 
    37 One of those children has provided a victim's impact statement. Section 27 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 applies. Division 2 of that Act dealing with victim impact statements to offences dealt with on indictment in the Supreme Court resulting in the death of a person. Section 28 of that Act provides that this court may, if it considers it appropriate to do so, receive and consider the victim impact statement at any time after it convicts but before it sentences an offender. If the primary victim has died as a result of the offence, the court must receive a victim impact statement given as here by a family victim and acknowledge its receipt, which I do. 
    38 Section 28(3) provides that the court may make any comment on it that the court considers appropriate. The Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v. Previtera (1997) 94 A. Crim. R. 76 has referred to the inappropriateness of the court having regard to any particular value placed on the life of the deceased by those near and dear to the deceased and that when considering punishment for the offence, such a statement should not be taken into account for the purpose of fixing punishment in the light of any such value. I do not consider the statement provided to me for that purpose. I do, however, note the tragedy in the family life referred to in this statement and the appalling consequence expressed by the author for her of being deprived of her mother. The court in every such case is cognisant that the offence to which the offender has pleaded guilty is one involving the unlawful taking of human life and that that means, of course, the depriving of others of the society of the deceased. 
    39 I turn then to the appropriateness of the sentence. Having regard to the findings I have made as to the offence, concerning the circumstances of the offender at the time of the commission of the offence and the submission that it was appropriate in the circumstances to consider a sentence containing a non-parole period, a range for which would extend from approximately 12 to 16 years, a substantial sentence is called for. 
    40 I pay regard to the offender's age and lack of family circumstances liable to lead to a lack of support for him at the expiration of the inevitably long period of confinement he must suffer but do not regard special circumstances as made out. 
    41 In all the circumstances, I conclude that the appropriate sentence I should pass is a sentence of 16 years with a non-parole period of 12 years. 
    42 Josip Badanjak, I sentence you to 16 years imprisonment to date from 24 January 2000. In respect of that sentence I impose a non-parole period of 12 years to date from that date.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 SPIGELMAN CJ: I will ask Justice Simpson to deliver the first judgment. 
      
       
     2 SIMPSON J: On 10 February 1999, following a trial by jury in the District Court, the appellant was convicted on a charge of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm. On 18 March 1999 Judge Tupman sentenced the appellant for that offence, and also for an offence of supplying a prohibited drug (25.53 grams of methylamphetamine), to which the appellant had earlier pleaded guilty. The two offences were quite unrelated. 
      
       
     3 On the drug charge, which carries a maximum penalty of fifteen years’ imprisonment and/or a fine of $220,000, Judge Tupman imposed a fixed term of nine months’ imprisonment to commence on 3 February 1999. In doing so, she took into account, pursuant to s 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, a charge of possession of a prohibited drug (8.1 grams of cannabis leaf). 
      
       
     4 For the offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm, which carries a maximum penalty of seven years’ imprisonment, Judge Tupman sentenced the appellant to a cumulative term of penal servitude for five years, divided into equal minimum and additional terms of two and a half years. 
      
       
     5 The appellant appeals against the conviction and seeks leave to appeal against the sentences. The appeal was listed for hearing on 26 June of this year. On that day, the appellant appeared unrepresented in this Court. He provided written grounds of appeal, which are set out below. 
      
       
     6 The trial began on 3 February 1999 and concluded with the jury verdict of guilty on 10 February 1999. For reasons that cannot satisfactorily be explained, the transcription tapes of the evidence of virtually the whole of the prosecution case and much of the defence case cannot be found. What survives is a tape recording of part of the evidence given by a medical practitioner in the Crown case, part of the cross-examination of the appellant's de facto wife, and the whole of the evidence given by her mother. Evidence was also given in the Crown case by the alleged victim, his wife, one other woman and two other men; and, in the defence case, by the appellant. 
      
       
     7 The Crown case (in the circumstances, best discerned from the summing up, to which no objection was taken at the trial or on appeal) was this. On the evening of 21 August 1996 the appellant went with his de facto wife (Catherine Elizabeth Stevenson) and her mother (Kathleen Alice Stevenson) to the St Marys Leagues Club, where they remained for some time. 
      
       
     8 The appellant said that he consumed only a small amount of alcohol and there appears to have been nothing in the Crown case to contradict this. The appellant then drove away, with the two women as passengers. It appears to have also been part of the Crown case that there was at least one other person, a male, in the car. Just outside the exit of the club, on the highway, he overtook (on the wrong side of the road) a Commodore being driven by the wife of the alleged victim, a Mr John Dobbin, and in which Mr Dobbin was a passenger. 
      
       
     9 Mr Dobbin described the manner in which the appellant drove his car as ""menacing"". He said that the appellant prevented Mrs Dobbin from overtaking, alternately accelerating and slowing his vehicle. Eventually both cars were required to stop at traffic control lights, the appellant's car a couple of lengths in front of Mr Dobbin's car. 
      
       
     10 At that point, according to Mr Dobbin, three men approached him, where he was sitting in the passenger side of his vehicle. One or more of the men pulled Mr Dobbin from his seat and dragged him towards the median strip. Two of the men began hitting, kicking and punching Mr Dobbin. One of them used a clublock for the purpose. It seems, from the summary contained in the judge’s directions to the jury, that it was Mr Dobbin who first produced the clublock, in response to the threat he perceived from the approach of the men. The men obtained possession of the clublock and the appellant used it to assault Mr Dobbin. 
      
       
     11 Evidence in the prosecution case as to these events was given by Mr Dobbin and his wife, and two men, Mr Fawcett and Mr Gamble, who observed part of the events from Mr Gamble's nearby home. 
      
       
     12 The appellant gave evidence in the trial. The thrust of his evidence, which was essentially supported by his de facto wife and her mother, was that it was Mr Dobbin who initiated the aggression by approaching the appellant's car while it was stopped at the lights, and by using the clublock to assault the appellant. A fight then took place in which the appellant acted only in self defence. He denied ever having used the clublock and denied that there were any other men in his car. 
      
       
     13 In this latter aspect, he was supported by the evidence of his de facto wife and her mother. The appellant formally admitted that the injuries sustained by Mr Dobbin amounted to grievous bodily harm. There was, therefore, a relatively narrow factual dispute to be resolved by the jury. The question of who initiated the violence, and whether the appellant acted in self defence, was of central importance. 
      
       
     14 The appellant's original written grounds of appeal are as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         ""1. 
          The trial was unfair 
          because witnesses were coached to perfection during periods where the trial judge sent the jury out. As such, the jury were not privy to vital visual and procedural evidence that may have led them to form different opinions than the one they arrived at. 
          
          
          2. In accordance with the above,  
         undue weight was given to witnesses' evidence 
          by the jury. Consequently, the jury were unable to arrive at a fair verdict based on them not having seen and heard all that occurred in the courtroom pertaining to the witnesses. 
          
          
          3. In summing up the  
         judge failed to adequately direct the jury 
          that witnesses had been permitted to study and revise their evidence prior to the jury being admitted into the courtroom. A direction according to the above may have left reasonable doubt in the jury's mind as to the weight they should or should not place on evidence given. 
          
          
          4. In accordance with points 1-3 above, the jury placed  
         undue credibility 
          on witnesses' evidence, which has resulted in a  
         miscarriage of justice. As a matter of public interest 
         , all juries should be made aware of any circumstances where a witness has been given time to refresh, revise or even plan strategies for the ensuing delivery of their testimony. Justice and Equity dictate the above. None of which was applied in my case."" (Emphasis in original) 
         
        
       
     15 On the initial hearing of the appeal, the appellant raised additional matters which could most accurately be taken as raising a further ground to the effect that the conviction was, having regard to the evidence, unreasonable. He asserted that there was evidence that he had not been identified in an identification parade; that descriptions of the offender given by witnesses of the person who committed the offence did not match his own personal characteristics; that there were inconsistencies between the evidence of Mr Dobbin and his wife as to the number of men, besides himself, who were present; that Mrs Dobbin was unable to describe how her husband had left the car. 
      
       
     16 Another matter put by the appellant - that is, that he admitted having been present and had even handed police a piece of the clublock - somewhat, but not completely, diminishes the value of the complaints concerning the description of him and lack of identification. In any event, the appellant's own account given in the trial acknowledged his presence. Identification was never an issue. In my opinion, those complaints that raise identification are without substance. 
      
       
     17 Where the ground of appeal is that a verdict is, in the old language, unsafe and unsatisfactory, or, in the new language, unreasonable having regard to the evidence, the obligation of this Court is to make its own assessment of the evidence. 
      
       
     18 Having regard to the additional ground of appeal, and to the absence of transcript, the Chief Justice, pursuant to s 11 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, requested Judge Tupman to furnish to the Registrar of the Court of Criminal Appeal her notes of the trial and a report giving her opinion: (a) upon the case; and in particular (b) the extent to which any discrepancy appeared to her to be material; (c) the relative credibility of the various witnesses; (d) the extent to, and the circumstances in, which Crown witnesses were, during the trial, permitted or encouraged to refresh their memories from statements they had made. 
      
       
     19 Judge Tupman was able to provide extensive notes of the evidence, which she had recorded on computer. They cover sixty closely typed pages and, in fact, amount almost to a transcript, or so it seems. This substantially overcomes the difficulties created by the loss of the tape recordings. The notes show that a jury was empanelled on 3 February 1999, but the case was not opened until the following day, 4 February. 
      
       
     20 Thereafter, Senior Constable Peter Hartley, Selwyn David Gamble, Dr Stapleton, Mathew James Fawcett, Linda Dobbin (the complainant's wife), Naomi Walton, Senior Constable Frost and Mr Dobbin gave evidence in the Crown case. The appellant gave evidence and called Catherine Elizabeth Stevenson (his de facto wife) and Kathleen Stevenson (his de facto wife's mother). 
      
       
     21 Judge Tupman in her report has conveniently summarised, from her notes, the evidence of these witnesses. I have also had recourse, where necessary, to the notes taken by her on the computer during the course of the trial. According to that summary, Mr Dobbin gave evidence of an encounter with another car, a Fairlane, which was being driven by the appellant. When both cars were forced to stop at traffic lights, two men approached his vehicle; one of them pulled open the passenger door and grabbed Mr Dobbin by the jacket. Mr Dobbin reached down and picked up the clublock and used it to hit the man in the chest. The man then dragged Mr Dobbin from the car. Mr Dobbin continued to hit him once or twice with the clublock, which came apart in two pieces. 
      
       
     22 The other man then picked up a piece of the clublock that had fallen to the ground and hit Mr Dobbin over the head with it. He said he was hit several times with the clublock and was dragged across the concrete median strip, where he was repeatedly kicked and hit with the clublock. He said the first time he was hit was by the other man, but on every other occasion it was by the driver of the Fairlane. 
      
       
     23 The appellant was legally represented at the trial by Mr Sandilands, an experienced solicitor employed in the Legal Aid Commission. He cross-examined Mr Dobbin. Judge Tupman's notes do not indicate any cross-examination suggesting any inconsistency between the account given by Mr Dobbin in evidence and that given by him in statements made for the purpose of the proceedings. 
      
       
     24 Mr Dobbin's wife gave evidence that was substantially consistent with his. There was, however, one significant discrepancy: her recollection was that three men approached the car. Mr Dobbin had only ever described two men. The appellant has sought to make something out of the fact that she did not see Mr Dobbin get out of the car and did not know how he did so, suggesting that this reflected on her credibility. 
      
       
     25 Evidence broadly corroborative of the Dobbins' evidence was given by two uninvolved observers. Selwyn Gamble lived in a house overlooking the intersection where the altercation occurred. A friend, Mathew Fawcett, was also present. Mr Gamble's attention was attracted by yelling and screaming and he went to his window to investigate. He saw a woman and three men. They were standing in front of a Commodore. 
      
       
     26 Mr Gamble walked onto his verandah for closer observation. He said the three men appeared to be fighting and one was being punched or, at least, pushed or shoved. Towards the end of the incident he went inside to ring the police. At about this time he saw a clublock. It was then intact. Shortly after he saw that the clublock had separated into two pieces and that two of the men had a piece each. One was shouting and waving the clublock around. He then saw two men jump into a car and drive away. 
      
       
     27 The Crown made an application under s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 for leave to question Mr Gamble as through cross-examining. Leave was granted. Subsequently a similar application was made in respect of Mr Fawcett, with the same result. Judge Tupman said in her report that, although she would have given extempore reasons for her decision, she could not, at the time of writing her report, recall what they were. For obvious reasons, they do not form part of the notes that she has provided. 
      
       
     28 Mr Gamble was then cross-examined by the Crown Prosecutor on the contents of a statement he had made to police shortly after the events. In the statement he said that he saw the man who had been dragged away from the car being kicked by one of the other two men, and being hit with a clublock by the other. In cross-examination, Mr Gamble rejected the proposition that it was Mr Dobbin who had approached the appellant's car (the Fairlane) rather than the other way around. 
      
       
     29 Mr Fawcett's evidence was also largely corroborative of Mr Dobbin's evidence. However, it seems unlikely that Mr Fawcett made any observation of the commencement of the altercation and, indeed, it seems unlikely that Mr Gamble saw its commencement. He described seeing two cars, one a Commodore parked in the street, and three people, all men, who were in a group and seemed to be having an argument. He then saw a woman alight from the passenger's side of the Commodore. One of the men was being ""thrown around"" by the other two. The two men had possession of a club lock but he didn't see how they came to have it. They used it to strike the third man around the body. They also kicked him.  
      
       
     30 Evidence was given in the Crown case by Ms Naomi Walton, who was acquainted with the appellant and who was walking along the highway on her way home when she saw a car she recognised as belonging to the appellant. She saw two men rolling on the ground, one of whom held a metal object aloft, but she was unable to say who was holding the object because of an obstruction to her view. She paid no further attention at the time. The following day she saw the appellant at his home and saw that he was bruised. She said that the appellant told her that when he had stopped his car at the intersection a second car had stopped behind him and a person had alighted and approached him with an iron bar. Leave was given, in a limited way, to the Crown to cross examine Ms Walton, but neither the notes nor the summary of evidence suggest that this cross examination threw any further light upon the issues.  
      
       
     31 That was the conclusion of the Crown case. 
      
       
     32 The appellant in his evidence maintained that Mr Dobbin was the aggressor and had hit him at least three times with the club lock. He asserted that it was only after this and in self defence, that he hit Mr Dobbin. He denied ever having had possession of the club lock. He said that an unidentified person entered the fray, pulled him off Mr Dobbin, and assaulted Mr Dobbin. He denied that any third person had been in his car and taken part in an assault of Mr Dobbin. This account was corroborated by Ms Catherine Stevenson, and, to a lesser extent, by Mrs Kathleen Stevenson. However, Judge Tupman in her report expressly observed that her memory of the demeanour of Miss Catherine Stevenson ""made her not particularly compelling"". Her Honour noted that Miss Stevenson's evidence was given over two days, or with an adjournment at some point in her evidence, and that, at one stage at least, she gave the appearance of a person affected by some form of substance. Judge Tupman was of the view that she was more probably than not under the influence of some sort of drug. 
      
       
     33 In relation to the specific questions asked of Judge Tupman, she expressed the view that discrepancies between evidence given by the Crown witnesses and that given by the accused and his witnesses were very significant. These discrepancies involved the issues of who had instigated the fight, at which car it took place, who had the club lock, the number of people involved and many other issues relevant to the Crown case. She considered that the resolution of these questions hinged upon the jury's acceptance of the reliability of the accused and his two female witnesses. That opinion is borne out by the summary of the evidence I have given above. The trial really involved a clear factual contest between the competing versions. It is, therefore, to be observed that in the summing up Judge Tupman correctly directed the jury that the onus of proof lay upon the Crown and the jury's task was not to determine which of two competing versions of events it preferred. 
      
       
     34 Judge Tupman had no clear recollection of her impressions of the credibility of the witnesses other than Ms Catherine Stevenson (which have been outlined above) nor of the appellant's assertion that witnesses had been permitted to refresh their memories from statements. 
      
       
     35 Finally, Judge Tupman said that as far as she could recall she had regarded the verdict as appropriate and available on the evidence. She considered that, in addition to other factors, the version of events contended for by the appellant was undermined by the medical evidence as to the number and severity of injuries suffered by Mr Dobbin. 
      
       
     36 I have attempted to make an independent evaluation of this assessment by Judge Tupman. Given the difficulties, it nevertheless appears to me to be in accordance with her quite extensive notes of the evidence of each witness. That is, an assessment of the evidence, both Crown and defence, leaves no sense of disquiet about the verdict of guilty. I would, accordingly, reject the ground of appeal that asserts that the verdict could not be sustained by the evidence. It was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the altercation had taken place as contended in the Crown case.  
      
       
     37 The four grounds of appeal originally pleaded and set out above all concern one matter: the appellant's assertion that witnesses ""were coached to perfection"" in the jury's absence. There is no evidence of any such coaching and, even taking into account the difficulties confronting the appellant by reason of the absence of transcript, I am satisfied that these grounds are based upon a misunderstanding of criminal trial procedure. It is not uncommon for witnesses to be permitted to refresh their recollections from statements, whether this occurs in or outside the court. There is no impropriety in the use of statements for this purpose. This falls far short of ""coaching"". It maybe that what the appellant is complaining of is the use of statements by two witnesses after the Crown had made an application under s 38 of the Evidence Act. This was, in each case, a perfectly proper application to make and was completely above board. While I can understand that the appellant might have felt that that course gave the prosecution an unfair advantage, I am of the view that that perception is a result of a lack of legal training. There was nothing untoward about what took place. I would, therefore, reject each of the grounds of appeal based upon the proposition that witnesses were coached. On the resumption of the hearing of the appeal the appellant was legally represented. Counsel then appearing challenged the leave granted by Judge Tupman under s 38 of the Evidence Act to permit two witnesses, Gamble and Fawcett, to be cross examined. In this respect exactly what happened can be discerned from the notes Judge Tupman has furnished. 
      
       
     38 Mr Gamble was called to give evidence and he gave evidence that covers about two and a half closely typed pages. Towards the end of that process he gave an answer that he couldn't remember and he was shown a photocopy of a statement that he made to police. At that point Judge Tupman's notes record that an application was made and this obviously was an application under s 38 for leave to cross examine. 
      
       
     39 The notes then refer to a series of paragraphs and contain a very short summary of what may be taken to be contained in those paragraphs. It is reasonable to infer that those paragraphs are references to the statement made by Mr Gamble, which is also before this court as part of the police brief which the court has in the circumstances of this case, received. 
      
       
     40 A short summary of what those references show and reference back to the notes of the evidence given by Mr Gamble shows that there were some discrepancies between what was contained in the statement and what he said in his evidence.  
      
       
     41 Further light is cast upon this in the affidavit evidence, particularly that of Miss Taylor, the solicitor who instructed the Crown Prosecutor at the trial, who said that a conference had been held with both Mr Gamble and Mr Fawcett. The affidavit does not identify when that conference was conducted but it does show that both witnesses had said in conference that they had some difficulty in recollection but when shown these statements they agreed that the statements appeared to be the statements that they had made at an earlier stage, and it may be presumed when their recollections were fresher. 
      
       
     42 As I have said, when Mr Gamble gave evidence the evidence he gave was in some respects not in accordance with that statement. It was that that gave rise to the application under s 38.  
      
       
     43 Section 38 (1) is relevantly in the following terms:  
      
       
        
         
         38. Unfavourable witnesses 
          
          
         (1) A party who called a witness may, with the leave of the court, question the witness, as though the party were cross-examining the witness, about:  
          
          
         (a) evidence given by the witness that is unfavourable to the party, or  
          
          
         (b) a matter of which the witness may reasonably be supposed to have knowledge and about which it appears to the court the witness is not, in examination in chief, making a genuine attempt to give evidence, or  
          
          
         (c) whether the witness has, at any time, made a prior inconsistent statement 
          
         
        
        
       The particular criticism that was made of the leave granted under s 38 relied upon the decision of the High Court in  
       Stanoevski v The Queen  
       [2001] HCA 4; 202 CLR 115 
        
       
     44 In that case the High Court drew attention to the provisions of s 192(2) of the Evidence Act, specifying certain matters that must be taken into account when a court is asked to give any “leave permission or direction” under the Evidence Act. Leave under s 38 to cross-examine a witness is subject to s 192(2). 
      
       
        
       No reasons for the s 38 decision have survived. 
        
       
     45 Mr Sandilands, the solicitor who appeared in the trial, has furnished an affidavit setting out his recollection of what occurred. He had some better than normal recall because this was his first trial after returning to work from long service leave. 
      
       
     46 As to the s 38 decision, he had only scant notes because he appeared as a solicitor advocate without an assisting solicitor. He recalled opposing the application but not the nature of the argument that he advanced. However, his practice, he deposed, was to record in note form any statutory provisions that were mentioned either in the course of argument or in the reasons for decision. 
      
       
     47 His notes indicated to him that he referred to sections 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act and that after the decision he unsuccessfully sought a limitation on the use of the evidence under s 136. 
      
       
     48 Significantly there was no mention in his notes of s 192 from which he had adduced that the section was not raised in argument or in the reasons given by the trial judge and it was for that reason that the appellant had recourse to the decision in Stanoevski v The Queen (supra). 
      
       
     49 The basis on which the applications were made is not at all clear on the unsatisfactory state of the evidence now available. Having regard to Mr Sandilands' affidavit it may safely be inferred that express mention was not made of s 192 either in the argument or in the judgment.  
      
       
     50 Section 192 is in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         192. Leave, permission or direction may be given on terms 
          
          
         (1) 
          If, because of this Act, a court may give any leave, permission or direction, the leave, permission or direction may be given on such terms as the court thinks fit.  
          
          
         (2) 
          Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give the leave, permission or direction, it is to take into account:  
          
          
           
           (a) the extent to which to do so would be likely to add unduly to, or to shorten, the length of the hearing, and  
            
           (b) the extent to which to do so would be unfair to a party or to a witness, and  
            
           (c) the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave, permission or direction is sought, and  
            
           (d) the nature of the proceeding, and  
            
           (e) the power (if any) of the court to adjourn the hearing or to make another order or to give a direction in relation to the evidence.  
           
          
         
        
       
     51 In Stanoevski  the High Court held, as I understand the decision, that the terms of s 192 are to be given full effect in any decision in which leave, permission or directions may be given during the course of the trial. Subsection 2 sets out (non exhaustively) five matters to which a judge is obliged to take into account in making such a decision.  
      
       
     52 Stanoevski does not in my opinion require a ritual incantation of each of the five considerations listed in subs 2. What it requires is that such of those matters, as well as other matters, be raised for consideration as a relevant to the particular application, be considered and taken into account. What distinguishes Stanoevski from many other cases is that the majority in the High Court took the view that if certain of the matters listed in s192 (2) had been taken into account and given due consideration a different result may well have eventuated. In other words, what the High Court held was that there was real substance in the particular application of s 192(2) in that case. What Stanoevski  does not hold is that failure to mention the section, or any of the matters listed in sub s (2) necessarily constitute error. Failure to mention either the subsection globally or the individual considerations, provides the foundation for a finding of error. But the finding may only be made if it is also shown that one or more of those conditions was actually material to the decision. 
      
       
     53 That means that it is necessary to ask which, if any, of those considerations were here truly material to the two s 38 decisions. Once again the capacity to do that is impeded to some extent by the absence of transcript but I do not think the task is impossible. Miscarriage in the exercise of discretion is not established by the mere failure to refer to a relevant statutory provision. For an appellant to succeed it is, in my opinion, necessary also to establish that the statutory provision was in reality material to the exercise of discretion that it at least potentially bore in a real sense on a decision to be made.  
      
       
     54 Nothing is here identified as material in that sense. Looking through the five considerations listed in s 192(2), it can be seen that the failure to mention the section or the considerations did not affect, and could not have affected, the decisions.  
      
       
     55 It was accepted there was no real impact or potential impact on the length of the trial: (sub para (a)); the evidence was important to the Crown case: (sub para (c)); the nature of the proceedings (a criminal trial) was so obvious it does not need to be stated (sub para (d)); there was no suggestion that the power of the court to adjourn or make any other order or directions (sub para (e)) was material. 
      
       
     56 That leaves only subpara 2(b) - the question of the extent to which to grant the leave would be unfair to a party or witness. 
      
       
     57 Although the issues are not identical, general questions of unfairness were raised for consideration by Mr Sandilands' reference to sections 135 and 137. 
      
       
     58 True it is that the phrasing of the sub paragraph is slightly different and what was required under s 192 was consideration of the extent to which to grant the leave would be unfair to a party or to a witness. There is nothing pointed to here, which, in my opinion, suggests that any unfairness to the appellant would or could have been caused by granting the leave Judge Tupman did. 
      
       
     59 In saying that I am conscious that counsel for the appellant referred to a particular piece of evidence that was elicited in cross examination concerning something said to have been done by Mrs Kathleen Stevenson which would have suggested that she was attempting to cover the number plate of the Fairlane.  
      
       
     60 I do not think that this caused or had potential at that stage to cause any real unfairness but in any case it is a question of the admissibility of the evidence or whether that particular piece of evidence should have been excluded under s 135 or 137. 
      
       
     61 Counsel for the appellant also directed attention to subsection (1) of section 192 arguing that if consideration had been given to the section there may well have been some limitation on or terms imposed in relation to the leave that was given. And once again reliance was placed upon the evidence suggesting that Mrs Stevenson had attempted to cover up the number plate and thereby showing some consciousness of wrong doing. 
      
       
     62 I am not satisfied that that evidence did, or, looking at the material as the trial Judge had to look at it at the time of the argument, had potential to cause any unfairness to the appellant such as contemplated by s 192(2)(b) and I am not satisfied that it would have required that any terms be imposed or limitation made on the use that could have been made of the evidence. 
      
       
     63 I am, therefore, satisfied that there was no miscarriage of justice in the grant of leave to cross-examine the two witnesses.  
      
       
     64 I should add that during the course of argument I made reference to s 32 of the Evidence Act but I am satisfied that if that section had been used either as a preliminary or alternative to s 38 there would have been no different result because it would have permitted the statements of the two witnesses to have been read and that is in effect what was put before the jury, although through cross-examination rather than having statements read. 
      
       
     65 The next ground concerned the alleged failure of the Crown to call Mrs Stevenson and Miss Stevenson to give evidence in the Crown case thereby causing the appellant to call them in his case and depriving him of the opportunity to cross examine and giving that opportunity to the Crown. 
      
       
     66 This court received oral evidence about what had occurred in that respect. Mr Sandilands had, at the time of the trial, recently returned from leave (on 20 January 1999). He wrote to the Crown asking if they were going to call “all witnesses” and if that was not their intention to advise him accordingly. 
      
       
     67 The Crown produced a letter in reply of the same date advising that it was not its intention to call either Mrs Stevenson or Miss Stevenson.  
      
       
     68 The argument was that the obligation of the Crown was to call the witnesses or to make them available to the appellant for cross examination and reliance was placed on a number of authorities to which I will refer in the final version of this judgment. 
      
       
     69 I am not persuaded that the Crown was obliged to call these witnesses and it was entitled to regard them as unreliable. I am satisfied that no real request was made to the Crown to call them. The Crown’s intention, as expressed is the letter, was accepted. Consideration was not, therefore, given by the Crown to any obligation it might have had to call those witnesses.  
      
       
     70 The fact is that the two witnesses were called, they gave evidence, they were seen, of course, to be in the appellant's camp and their evidence was not accepted.  
      
       
     71 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
      
       
     72 The result is that I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. 
      
       
     73 The appellant, (as I shall continue to refer to him) did not address any separate argument to the application for leave to appeal against the sentences initially. I observe, firstly, it was entirely correct for the judge to make the sentences cumulative. The two offences for which the appellant was being sentenced were quite unrelated to one another. Submissions were subsequently made on behalf of the applicant on sentence, it being argued that the sentence was manifestly excessive.  
      
       
     74 The gravity of the malicious wounding offence may be gauged by, among other things, the severity of the injury to Mr Dobbin. As recounted by the judge in her summing up, he suffered a lacerated scalp, multiple bruising and sites of pain, a compound depressed skull fracture and a right pneumothorax with lung contusions. He had fractured ribs and required surgery. He had a period of hospitalisation and suffered from scarring.  
      
       
     75 To exacerbate the circumstances, the offence was committed by the appellant in the company of at least one other man and was, on the finding of her Honour, unprovoked by the victim. The appellant was on bail for the drug offence at the time. He had a lengthy criminal history, although, as her Honour noted, he had been convicted of no offences involving violence since 1984. 
      
       
     76 There was evidence of some subjective material. The appellant was forty nine at the time of sentencing. He had had a rather troubled start to life, his father having committed suicide when the appellant was three years old. His step father was a violent alcoholic. The appellant left home at fourteen and took up a transient lifestyle with, as his record discloses, frequent criminal enterprises. 
      
       
     77 He is the father of three children, aged 3, 6 and 10, of whom two were in his care at the time of his sentencing. He described his former de facto as a drug addict who had been in, but had voluntarily left, a rehabilitation centre. He expressed a great deal of concern about the welfare of the children in the event of his incarceration. He said that he would be devastated by imprisonment. 
      
       
     78 He has poor health. He claimed to have suffered several heart attacks, the most recent having occurred whilst he was in custody. He suffers from asthma and requires some orthopaedic surgery. Judge Tupman was aware of and took into account all of these matters. 
      
       
     79 This court received from the appellant a letter from a court prison chaplain from the Salvation Army. However, this material is available only to be taken into account for the purposes of resentencing in the event that this court were to find that there had been some error in the sentencing process. Particularly having regard to the ferociousness and severity of the attack, I am not satisfied that any such error has been shown. I would grant leave to appeal against the severity of sentence but dismiss the appeal.  
      
       
     80 The court was told that there may have been an earlier abandonment of the application for leave to appeal against sentence and, as already ordered, and to the extent it is necessary, leave has been granted to withdraw that abandonment. 
      
       
     81 Accordingly, the orders that I propose are that the appeal against conviction be dismissed; that leave to appeal against sentence be granted and the appeal be dismissed. 
      
       
     82 SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree 
      
       
     83 SMART AJ: I also agree. 
      
       
     84 SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders are as indicated by Simpson J. **********

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
     1 SPIGELMAN CJ: The Applicant pleaded guilty to one count of supplying a prohibited drug, namely cannabis, contrary to ss25(1) and 29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. He was sentenced by his Honour Judge Luland QC in the Campbelltown District Court on 23 February 2001. He asked that another offence of cultivating a prohibited plant be taken into account on a Form 1. His Honour sentenced the Applicant to imprisonment for twenty months to commence on 23 February 2001 and to expire on 22 October 2002. His Honour fixed a non-parole period of fifteen months to expire on 26 May 2002. 
      
       
     2 His Honour did not make a direction that the Applicant be released at the expiration of the non-parole period. It was common ground that he was required to do so pursuant to s50(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Accordingly it will be necessary for this Court to vary the trial judge’s orders by making a direction in accordance with that section. 
      
       
     3 On 26 November 1999 police attended the premises of the Applicant at Fairfield. Those premises were divided into three flats in one of which he resided with his family. When the police entered the other flats they found a significant operation of cultivating cannabis. In one flat they found a room divided into three smaller areas each containing artificial lighting, a fan and a power system as well as watering systems and a number of pots containing cannabis plants. In the second flat the room was also divided into three separate areas. Again there were pots and separate seedling boxes under artificial lighting. In the kitchen there were a number of containers of dried cannabis leaf. There were indications that growing had been in progress since about May 1999. There was also found paraphernalia often found in connection with drug supply, including two sets of scales. In total 169 plants were found by police with an average height of about one metre. In addition there was a total of 5,017.5 grams of cannabis leaf. 
      
       
     4 Reference was made to R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 which held that the utilitarian value of a guilty plea would be in the range of ten to twenty-five percent. His Honour indicated the appropriate sentence was one of two years imprisonment, from which he deducted four months for the plea, that is sixteen percent. In his remarks on sentence his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “ … I have had regard to his plea of guilty which, although it did not come at the first reasonable opportunity, I am prepared to accept came at an earlier stage of proceedings which had the utilitarian benefit of the Crown not having to proceed to a trial.” 
         
        
       
     5 As I indicated in my judgment in Thomson and Houlton at [153], the determination of where within the range a discount should fall, is in the discretion of the sentencing judge. In this case, the fact that the plea was not at the earliest opportunity indicated that a percentage at the top of the range was not appropriate. In Thomson and Houlton at [154] I referred to two findings which would “generally affect the appropriate level of discount”. One was the timing of the plea. The other is not often referred to in appeals to this Court. It should not be ignored. I indicated that the difficulty of assembling evidence and the length and complexity of the trial would increase the utilitarian value of the plea. The circumstances in this case were not particularly complex. Nor was a trial likely to be of any great length.  
      
       
     6 In these circumstances a discount of sixteen percent was well within his Honour’s discretion. This ground of appeal should be rejected. 
      
       
     7 It was also submitted that his Honour failed to give “any effective weight to the Applicant’s subjective features”. This submission was based on the particular structure of his Honour’s ex tempore reasons. 
      
       
     8 His Honour referred to the objective circumstances of the case, specifically the quantity of drugs involved. His Honour then suggested a period of two years imprisonment and identified the discount for the plea. His Honour then referred to hardship to the family and indicated that that hardship, in the circumstances, would not justify taking a different course than the imposition of a full time custodial sentence of two years as discounted for the plea. 
      
       
     9 The submission is that this reference, at one part of his Honour’s reasons, represented the whole of his Honour’s consideration of subjective features. Indeed, in the written submissions the structure of this part of the reasons was referred to as an “equation”. That is not, in my opinion, a correct understanding of his Honour’s reasons.  
      
       
     10 His Honour had set out, over more than two pages, the whole of the subjective circumstances put before the Court, before making reference to the subjective circumstances of the offender in the passage upon which reliance is placed. In doing so his Honour referred to a number of different aspects of the Applicant’s personal history and current situation. His Honour specifically said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I have had regard to all of the subjective factors that have been spelled out in the pre-sentence report and in addition there was tendered on his behalf a report from a psychologist … “ 
         
        
       
       
       His Honour proceeded to summarise the effect of that report.  
        
       
     11 His Honour gave full consideration to the subjective features in a passage of his reasons prior to his Honour arriving at the starting point of two years. 
      
       
     12 The Applicant also submitted that his Honour failed to determine whether to suspend the sentence pursuant to s12(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Section 12(1) empowers a Court that imposes a sentence of imprisonment of not more than two years to make an order suspending the sentence. The Applicant referred to the decision in R v Blackman and Walters [2001] NSWCCA 121, in which s12(1)(a) was described as involving a two stage approach, first identifying that a term of imprisonment was called for and then determining that the term should be suspended. In that case, the Court referred to R v Dinsdale (2000) 202 CLR 321 per Kirby J and R v JCE [2000] NSWCCA 498. 
      
       
     13 It was submitted that in the present case the second step was not separately taken. That may be so. Indeed, that step was not taken at all. His Honour did not suspend the sentence. He gave express reasons for not doing so. 
      
       
     14 The position under the New South Wales legislation is quite different from that which was considered by the High Court in Dinsdale. The West Australian legislation there under consideration required a court not to use a sentencing option unless it was satisfied that it was not appropriate to use any option listed before that option in the structure of the legislation. (See for example at par [11] per Gleeson CJ and Hayne J.) In this State, s5(1) merely provides that a court should not impose a sentence of imprisonment unless it is satisfied that no other sentence is appropriate. 
      
       
     15 In the present case his Honour gave express consideration to the fact that only a sentence of full time custody was appropriate. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Those who do engage in the supply of drugs must expect when they are caught to be dealt with by courts seriously.” 
         
        
       
     16 His Honour referred to authorities in this Court to the effect  
      
       
        
         
         “… it should be only 
           
         in exceptional cases that persons substantially involved in the supply of drugs be sentenced in any way other 
           
         than full time custody.” 
         
        
       
     17 His Honour went on to find that the involvement of the Applicant was “substantial” and concluded: 
      
       
        
         
         “The only appropriate manner in which I can deal with this, given the objective seriousness, is by way of imposing a full time custodial sentence.” 
         
        
       
       
       My Byrne SC, who appeared for the Applicant, submitted that the authorities to which his Honour referred preceded the reintroduction of suspended sentences by s12 of the Act. Nevertheless, counsel appearing at trial had emphasised the option of suspension. His Honour plainly intended his remarks to deal with this submission by rejecting it. It was open to his Honour to do so. 
        
       
     18 His Honour gave express reasons for his decision to choose the particular sentencing option which his Honour chose. Nothing more was required of him (see JCE at [19]). This ground of appeal should be rejected. 
      
       
     19 The final submission was that the sentencing judge erred in failing to find special circumstances. It was submitted that the Applicant’s potential for rehabilitation, the significance of the early plea and the fact that imprisonment will be particularly burdensome upon the Applicant due to his family situation, constituted such circumstances. The issue of the proper construction of “special circumstances” for the purpose of imposing a lower non-parole period, will be considered in this Court by a bench of five later this week. I am content in the present case to proceed on the basis that all of the factors identified by counsel for the Appellant were capable of constituting special circumstances, although all were taken into account by his Honour in determining the head sentence. 
      
       
     20 I agree with the reasoning of Howie J in R v Keong [2001] NSWCCA 416 at [15] that the finding of special circumstances is in part a finding of fact. This Court should be very slow to review such a finding. 
      
       
     21 The matters now relied upon by the Applicant were fully before his Honour. His Honour made reference to these matters when outlining the circumstances of the Applicant. In my view his Honour was entitled to conclude that the matters did not involve special circumstances which justified a lower non-parole period. His Honour had taken the matters into account in fixing the head sentence. In my opinion, no error appears in his Honour’s reasoning in this regard. 
      
       
     22 The Court should make the following orders: 
      
       
       
       1 Leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
        
        
       2 Vary the order of Luland DCJ of 23 February 2001 by adding the following: 
        
        
         
         “Direct that Paul Italo Saldaneri be released to parole on 22 May 2002”. 
         
        
        
       3 Appeal otherwise dismissed. 
        
        
        
        
       
     23 SULLY J: I agree with the orders proposed. 
      
       
     24 GREG JAMES J: I also agree. 
      
       
     25 SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders of the court are as I have indicated.

     1 SPIGELMAN CJ: The Appellant was indicted before his Honour Judge Kirkham at the Sydney District Court on one count, that he between 28 June 1993 and 11 November 1993, at Sydney, in the State of New South Wales, did supply a prohibited drug, namely heroin, in an amount not less than the large commercial quantity contrary to s25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. 
     2 He was sentenced on 17 April 1998 to imprisonment for life. 
     3 The appeal was brought out of time. Leave to appeal on an extension of time was required and should be given. 
     4 In the course of his Honour’s summing-up, his Honour made certain directions in accordance with the practice in this State at that time with respect to the failure of the Appellant to give evidence in the trial. This was of considerable significance because the principal evidence against the Defendant was given by the co-offender, Mr Houang. 
     5 In the course of his summing-up, his Honour said the following: 
      
      
       
        
         
         “In this case, in the present case the Crown asks you however when judging the value or the weight of the evidence which has been put forward by the Crown, particularly the evidence of Mr Houang, as establishing its case against the accused, to take into account the accused’s election not to deny or contradict matters about which he could have given direct evidence from his own personal knowledge. That is indeed a circumstance which you might consider in this case. 
         
        
       
       
       
        
         
         You may think that it is only common sense that in a situation where, as in this case, Houang and the accused are said to be directly involved in an alleged activity over a period of time, so that they are the two persons best able to give evidence of what happened, if anything, over that period of time, involving the accused and where the evidence of Houang is left undenied and uncontradicted by the accused, any doubts which may otherwise have been cast upon Houang’s evidence may more readily be discounted and Houang’s may more readily be accepted as the truth. That is the approach which the Crown asks you to adopt in this case in relation to Houang’s evidence that the accused supplied heroin over the relevant period as alleged.” 
         
        
       
       
     6 The High Court has subsequently, in RPS v The Queen (2000) 199 CLR 620 and also in Azzopardi v The Queen [2001] HCA 25; 75 ALJR 931 held that directions of that character ought not be made, save in particular circumstances. There is no suggestion that any such circumstances apply in the present case. 
     7 The evidence of Houang was central to the proceedings. The reinforcement given to Houang’s evidence by his Honour’s directions to the jury, in the part I quoted, was of significance in the case. It cannot be, and has not been, suggested by the Crown that there was not a miscarriage of justice by reason of the error in the summing-up. An error, which I hasten to say, suggests no criticism of his Honour by reason of the fact that his Honour acted in accordance with the practice in this State prior to the High Court’s decisions. Nevertheless, the effect is that a miscarriage of justice has occurred in the present case. Accordingly, the appeal should be upheld and there should be a retrial. 
     8 SULLY J: I agree. 
     9 GREG JAMES J: I agree.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
     1 SPIGELMAN, CJ: I invite Justice Greg James to deliver the first judgment. 
      
       
     2 GREG JAMES J: The appellant appeals against conviction and seeks leave to appeal against the severity of his sentence. 
      
       
     3 The appellant was convicted of one count of being knowingly concerned with Elias Helou in the importation of not less than a trafficable quantity of cocaine, an offence under s.233B(1)(d) of the Customs Act 1901, punishable pursuant to s.235 of that Act by a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. The appellant had pleaded not guilty and had been found guilty by the verdict of a jury after a three day trial. The trial was initially also of Helou as well as the appellant, but when problems occurred with Mr. Helou's representation, the prosecution proceeded against the appellant alone. 
      
       
     4 The quantity of cocaine involved was some 114.5 grams. A trafficable quantity is two grams. 
      
       
     5 On 1 June 2001, the learned District Court judge sentenced the appellant to six years imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years, that sentence to commence on the day on which the appellant was taken into custody following the jury's verdict. Prior to that verdict, the appellant had been on bail. 
      
       
     6 The appellant had an earlier criminal record. The trial judge found on sentencing that he had been convicted for supply and possession in 1996, although his Honour noted that there was evidence that he had overcome the drug addiction from which he then suffered. 
      
       
     7 It was submitted on behalf of the respondent that the evidence at trial disclosed the following:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""The prosecution evidence presented at trial is that 114.5 grams (pure – 196.9 grams net weight) of cocaine was concealed in a car radio cassette player which had been sent from the United States in a package, together with a car rear vision mirror. The package was addressed to a 'Terry Burger' of 'care of L.J. Imports, 343 Pitt Street, Sydney'. At about 4.15 pm on 4 December 2000, a customs officer examined the parcel containing these items at the premises of freight importers, Federal Express. He located a bundle bound in black tape inside the cassette player. The bundle was tested for narcotic goods that gave a presumptive reading for cocaine. The matter was referred to Federal Police who removed the drug and reconstructed the parcel with an inert substance (and sample of the original substance). 
         
        
        
         
         At about 11.50 pm on 4 December 1999, two men approached the front delivery counter of Federal Express and spoke to the clerk, Mr. Blacker. Mr. Blacker had seen both men previously, including the appellant, who he had seen once previously. The other man he knew as Louie. There was a conversation and the appellant was introduced by 'Louie' as his 'friend, Terry'. A package number was asked for and it was ascertained by computer search that it had not yet cleared customs. A conversation occurred with 'Louie' and another employee, by phone, in relation to the parcel and he asked if he could wait. Mr. Blacker said he was locking up and going home but suggested that the men wait outside the roller door in case the item was cleared. He saw the men waiting. During this period the customs broker, Ms. Hall, was contacted and there was discussion about the item being released that day. The appellant's mobile phone number was given as a contact number. Both men participated in conversation. Later, phone calls are made enquiring from a person named 'Terry'. There were a number of calls enquiring about the parcel. 
         
        
        
         
         At 2.50 pm on Monday 6 December 1999, following conversation with police, Mr. Blacker again met the appellant and the person 'Louie'. The appellant signed for the parcel in the name of Terry Burger. Police were present. The appellant left the building and got into a car that drove off. Police followed for a short distance. The appellant was the passenger and Helou, the driver. After a short period the vehicle stopped and the appellant was seen to go to a large dumpster and throw in a box. He re-entered the vehicle and it drove off. The vehicle was stopped not long afterwards. The package containing the control delivery bundle was found on the floor of the vehicle on the passenger side floor. Also located were a number of pieces of paper (receipts and torn packaging from the parcel), the car mirror from the parcel, a screw driver, two mobile phones and receipts for international money transfer. The international money transfer receipts were each in the sum of $9,000. Two were in the name of Helou and two in the name of the appellant. Documentary evidence was tendered of the appellant sending money overseas to Los Angeles, on 25 November 1999 and 3 December 1999 using his passport as identification. The appellant was spoken to but made no admissions. 
         
        
        
         
         Police searched the appellant's home on the same day, however, nothing of interest was located. The home of the co-accused Helou's parents was searched and a quantity of cash, cocaine, ammunition and receipts for the transfer of relatively large sums of money were located. 
         
        
        
         
         Evidence was given that fingerprints were located on the package containing the controlled delivery, located on the floor of the vehicle after it was stopped. Evidence was given that the only fingerprint located was that of the man Helou and that this appellant's fingerprints were not located."" 
         
        
       
     8 The submissions for the appellant drew attention to the following matters in addition to those referred to in the submissions for the respondent. 
      
       
        
         
         ""The appellant attended FedEx on 4 December 1999 with Helou but they were unable to collect the package at that time for the purported reason that it had yet to clear customs. At that time, although Helou did most of the talking, the witness Hall said that the appellant 'said a few things'. Although there is reference in Hall's evidence to talking 'about clearing this package about clearing procedures', it is submitted that it is not clear on the face of the transcript whether the witness was referring to the appellant's contribution to the conversation or the conversation as a whole (in which case those matters may have emanated from Helou). Furthermore, it is submitted that it was likely on the evidence that all of the talking on the mobile phone was conducted by Helou, although there was no dispute that the number given to FedEx (by 'Louie', ie., Helou) was the appellant's mobile phone number. 
         
        
        
         
         The appellant again attended FedEx with Helou on 6 December 1999. On that date, the appellant physically collected the parcel and when doing so printed and signed the name 'Terry Burger', the name of the person to whom the package was addressed. It is noted that the witness Blacker agreed in cross-examination that he had no memory of the appellant actually saying that his name was Terry Burger at the time. 
         
        
        
         
         The appellant was observed to be looking down towards the console as police followed the car that he was in with Helou. The appellant was also observed assisting Helou rip open the package. When giving evidence the appellant agreed that at one point he was looking down at the console. 
         
        
        
         
         In a subsequent search of Helou's house a large amount of cocaine, $40,000 cash and ammunition were found. A search of the appellant's house was conducted with nothing of interest being found."" 
         
        
       
     9 The appellant gave evidence in his own defence. The submissions to this court of the appellant made the following points:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""5.2 It is submitted that the appellant's explanations relating to the various aspects of the Crown case referred to in 2. above were not inherently incredible or implausible. In summary, such explanations were as follows:- 
         
        
        
         
          5.2.1 The appellant gave a full explanation as to why he was spending large amounts of time with Helou and various documentation was tendered in support of such explanation, none of which was contradicted by any other evidence in the trial. 
         
        
        
         
          5.2.2 The appellant have a full explanation as to the circumstances under which he agreed to transfer money overseas at Helou's request after Helou told him that he didn't have any ID on him at the relevant times. 
         
        
        
         
          5.2.3 The appellant gave a full explanation as to why he collected the parcel and signed for it as 'Terry Burger' (having been told that Terry Burger was Helou's employee and that he was away but that the parcel had to be collected in his name). Under cross-examination, the appellant gave evidence that, although he was uncomfortable doing such a thing, he wanted to help Helou out as a prospective business partner. 
         
        
        
         
          5.2.4 The appellant gave evidence that the first time he suspected something may be amiss was in the car after he saw the black ball. 
         
        
        
         
         5.3 Helou was clearly implicated in the importation by virtue of the drugs and money that were found at his house and the fact that his fingerprints were located on the black ball. Nothing incriminating was found at the premises of the appellant nor could he be linked to the offence in any way other than as set out in 2. above. It is also submitted that Helou's involvement was reflected in diary entries in Helou's diary consistent with requests to others to transfer amounts at his request, there being no evidence that any of those other people had any relationship to the appellant or to the proceedings. 
         
        
        
         
         5.4 In circumstances where the explanations given by the appellant were, on their face, at least plausible, and where the preponderance of evidence points to the guilt of Helou, it is submitted the jury's finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had the requisite knowledge was unreasonable and unable to be supported by the evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         5.5 It is noted in the present case that the Crown bore the onus throughout of proving the requisite knowledge on the appellant's part and it is in that context that the submission in paragraph 5.4 above is made: cf.  
         Regina v. Thomas 
          (New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported 28 May 1996)."" 
         
        
       
     . 
      
       
     10 The respondent submitted:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""There is clear evidence of the appellant sending large sums of money overseas, attempting to collect and in fact collecting the parcel in a false name. There was evidence of his being party to opening the parcel and disposing of part of the contents a short time afterwards. The appellant gave evidence and was cross-examined. He gave explanations for each aspect of his incriminating involvement. It is clearly not the law that the jury must accept his explanations. It is a matter for the jury to determine that the prosecution case is proved beyond reasonable doubt on the evidence. There is material that the jury may not accept such as Helou opening the parcel whilst driving the car and removing the drug from the cassette player. The appellant stating that the drug bundle ended up on his side of the car by Helou throwing it at him, within the confines of the car and without being observed by nearby police. The jury would be entitled to reject his explanations for sending the money overseas and, using the false name and the circumstances of collecting the parcel. The jury has had the advantage of seeing and hearing the evidence."" 
         
        
       
     11 This recital of the various submissions gives context to the grounds of appeal. On conviction, three grounds have been asserted. They are:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""1. The trial judge erred in his directions to the jury as to what the Crown was required to prove to establish the element of knowledge on the appellant's part. 
         
        
        
         
         2. The trial judge erred in his directions to the jury regarding unidentifiable fingerprints located on the black ball containing the cocaine. 
         
        
        
         
         3. That the verdict was unreasonable and unable to be supported by the evidence."" 
         
        
        
       Ground one 
        
       
     12 The trial judge directed the jury as to the requirement of the element of the accused being knowingly concerned in the offence as follows:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""What is the offence? The offence is that he knowingly concerned himself in that importation, together with Mr. Helou, and that the importation was of a prohibited import under the Customs Act, namely cocaine, and it was more than a trafficable quantity."" 
         
        
       
     13 His Honour defined importation as:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""… simply means to bring something within the boundaries of our country and that the crown says you will be satisfied that that is the case because the package was received at FedEx and it was analysed and ultimately it was given over to the police and there was the controlled delivery and ultimately passed on or collected by the accused and the accused, together with Mr. Helou, went off in the car with it. It was well within the boundaries of our country and therefore the Crown says to you you will be satisfied that there was the importation of the prohibited import."" 
         
        
       
     14 The offence had been charged as having been committed between 4 and 6 December 1999 that is, between the date on which the appellant, together with Louie (Mr. Helou), went firstly to the cargo section to collect the parcel and the date upon which they were apprehended with the prohibited imports, 6 December. 
      
       
     15 At p.16 of his summing-up, the trial judge defined the requirement of knowingly concerned more closely:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""What the case is all about is the requirement of the Crown to prove that the accused was knowingly concerned with Mr. Helou in this matter. Therefore, I am required to tell you what the law means when it speaks about a person being knowingly concerned in an importation. To be knowingly concerned means to do something which involves a practical connection with the offence and all that is involved with the offence. The operative words there are to do something which involves you in that practical connection. 
         
        
        
         
         Simply to stand by and be aware that somebody is importing drugs and for you to do nothing about it does not mean that you are knowingly concerned in the importation. The law requires that you must actively do something in connection with the crime to facilitate its importation, to be in some way physically connected with the act. 
         
        
        
         
         The knowledge is something that the Crown must prove. We know, and it has not been argued, that in fact the accused collected the package from FedEx and that when it was opened the bag with the tape around it was ultimately shown to have contained the cocaine. The fact in itself that the accused collected the item and that he was in the car in which the item was found does not prove in itself that he was knowingly concerned with the importation. What is required to be proven is that he knew he was – knew that what he was collecting was cocaine and he was knowingly concerned with that importation. 
         
        
        
         
         So it is that state of mind, that knowledge that the Crown has to prove to you, that he knew what was being imported and he was knowingly connected with it, knowingly participated in that importation. The fact of knowledge may be proven to you, in various ways you may prove a person's knowledge. You may prove a person's knowledge by what a person says. If the person says he knows what the package contained, well you would act upon that statement that he knew, that he had the knowledge. 
         
        
        
         
         That is not the case here. There is no direct evidence, as it were, that the accused knew. There is no evidence of any statement on his part or anybody else's part that he knew what was in the package. But that is not the only way in which the Crown may prove to your satisfaction, to the extent that it must, a person's knowledge. Knowledge can be inferred from things that are done by a person. You may look at a person's acts and from those various acts that a person does you may infer that he knew what the substance was and that he knowingly thereby concerned himself in the offence by acts he did. 
         
        
        
         
         The Crown says that that is what this case is all about. The Crown says to you you will look at the acts of the accused, what he did, how he did them and his connection with Mr. Helou in doing them, that you will from those acts infer that he is guilty of the crime. I will come back to what the Crown says those acts are shortly but that is the way in which the Crown presents its case to you to prove the accused's knowledge."" 
         
        
       
     16 His Honour further on in the summing up, directed the jury that for them to find the appellant guilty, they must be satisfied on the facts accepted by them beyond reasonable doubt that the inference of the appellant being knowingly concerned was the only inference the jury could draw. That direction was given in association with his Honour putting the appellant's defence that he had been present and did those things the Crown asserted knowingly but did them as a favour to Mr. Helou because he was embarking upon a business venture with him. 
      
       
     17 It was put to the jury that his defence was that he used the name ""Terry Burger"" as a matter of convenience to Mr. Helou, not knowing what it was that was being imported but believing that it was something to do with car parts. His Honour also put to the jury the Crown's contention that the on- going association, the overseas sending of the money and the appellant's presence during the conversations Mr. Helou had with FedEx operatives without demurrer, were such as to show the appellant's knowing and active involvement in the importation arising from his being party to the collection of the package. The case was put in this way:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""But the Crown says you will not see it that way. You will see it as the accused being party to the collection of this package. And it is not disputed that it was in fact the accused who went in and got the parcel. That cannot be disputed. There is the physical evidence for you to see yourself that he went and got it. And it is not in dispute that he used the name Terry Burger, the name to whom the package was addressed. The Crown says to you that that is another factor that you will take into account, that the accused is using, as it were, a false name to collect the package. The accused says, as to that, well I am there, Mr. Helou told me that it was his employee and that it would be embarrassing for him as the boss to be collecting the parcel so I obliged and collected it for him. That was on the first occasion that he did it and on the second occasion again he was there and so as a matter of convenience he went and collected it. 
         
        
        
         
         The Crown says to you you will reject the accused's version about his innocent association with it and that you will see it as a guilty association of him collecting the parcel. The Crown says that beyond the collecting, he also showed interest in the parcel in as much as he was observed to have been looking down towards the console area where, the Crown argues to you, the likelihood is that the parcel was being opened, as it were, very shortly after it was collected and that the accused himself had taken some papers – ripped off some of the parts of the package and threw them out of the car and ultimately deposited the box with its identification features having been removed into the bine that it was placed in. 
         
        
        
         
         The Crown says to you that all of that, the payment of the money, followed by the collection of the goods and the specific interest in it there afterwards all shows that he was acting together with Mr. Helou. The Crown's case is it is not a question of who or which of them committed this offence, the Crown's case is they both were committing this offence. The argument has been well look all of the feature of this case point towards Mr. Helou (sic). HE was the one whose fingerprint was able to have been identified on the black ball. He was the one that had some cocaine in his home. He was the one who had sent a whole lot of other monies. He was the one who had $40,000 cash. He had all of the earmarks of being the person who was involved. 
         
        
        
         
         Well the Crown probably accepts that argument that Mr. Helou certainly was involved, but the Crown argues to you the evidence will show you beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was also involved knowingly concerned in this importation. Whether he was as involved or not as involved, the Crown does not argue. The Crown certainly accepts that Mr. Helou was involved and argues that the accused also was involved."" 
         
        
       
     18 It is submitted that the trial judge erred in failing clearly to direct the jury as to the time at which the Crown case showed the appellant had the relevant knowledge. It is submitted that the jury should have been directed explicitly that the appellant needed to have the relevant knowledge at the time of his actual physical involvement, which it was submitted was as at the handing over of the package and that the jury had not been so directed. 
      
       
     19 Such a submission is in disregard of the way in which the Crown put its case, and of the directions as to that case given by the learned trial judge I have set out. It is clear that there was a case put of this appellant and Helou having embarked upon a joint endeavour to import the drugs. It is apparent that this was the way in which the trial judge perceived the matter from the terms of his summing up. No application for re-direction or complaint of any deficiency was made at the time by trial counsel. This suggests that counsel similarly perceived the Crown case. Indeed, the argument that was advanced on the appellant's behalf at trial was that at all times he had been duped. No question of any issue about the coincidence between involvement in the importation and having necessary knowledge arose. However, here it was submitted on his behalf that the jury might well have returned the guilty verdict on the basis that the appellant found out in the car, after the physical handing over of the parcel, that the substance was cocaine. 
      
       
     20 I see no danger of that kind in the way in which the whole of the directions were given. It was left to the jury as an alternative hypothesis that he was a dupe. There was no suggestion that such a submission should be discounted because the appellant found out there were drugs in the black package (the black ball) in the car. 
      
       
     21 In the event that his remission of monies overseas and his assistance to the obtaining of the package at the FedEx counter was in ignorance of what was really going on, the submission that he was a dupe would at least have raised a reasonable doubt. The appellant gave evidence and the jury were well able to appreciate the evidentiary issues which, after all, were within a very narrow compass. It is apparent the jury rejected the appellant's explanation. Nor is there ay complaint as to how his Honour put the directions on this matter. 
      
       
     22 I see no basis upon which, in the context of this trial, this direction concerning ""knowingly concerned"" might be regarded as erroneous, nor do I see any basis on which, having regard to the way in which I consider the Crown case was perceived, leave should be granted. I would refuse leave to argue this ground. 
      
       
        
       Ground 2 
        
       
     23 It is submitted that his Honour erred when he directed the jury that:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""The only person whose fingerprint was on the item was that of Mr. Helou. That is correct, the only identifiable print was Mr. Helou's. The evidence of the police was that there was some other fingerprints there that were not able to be identified. You cannot speculate that they were the accused or were not the accused. The only evidence is that the only identifiable print was that of Mr. Helou."" 
         
        
       
     24 It is submitted that this direction was unfair to the appellant as it tended to suggest it might be that the prints, if able to be identified, would have been the appellant's. No application was made for re-direction in this regard. I see no basis upon which the direction can be regarded as in any way unfair to the appellant. Nor was it apparently perceived to be so at trial. I would refuse leave to argue this ground. 
      
       
        
       Ground 3 
        
       
     25 It is contended that the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt on the evidence. The submission that is put in that regard is that the appellant's explanations should have been accepted by the jury. It is put that they were not inherently incredible or implausible. It is submitted that because there was substantial evidence to show that Helou was guilty and that the explanations given by the appellant were ""at least plausible"", the jury should have had a reasonable doubt that the appellant had the requisite knowledge. The submission recognises implicitly that the appellant had the requisite concern, ie., involvement in the actual importation. 
      
       
     26 What is left at issue in the submission is the question of his knowledge. His knowledge was to be inferred from all the circumstances proved and particularly ascertained in the light of his evidence in chief and of his evidence under cross-examination. It is sufficient to say that his evidence gave, at best, plausible explanations and explanations which, on their face, a jury might well have rejected. 
      
       
     27 The test applicable in such circumstances has been enunciated in a number of cases including Gipp v. The Queen (1998) 155 ALR 15; Jones v. The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439; M v. The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 and Morris v. The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 454. 
      
       
     28 There was abundant evidence upon which it was open to the jury to convict, and the assessment of the appellant as a witness together with the assessment of the plausibility of his explanations were very much matters for the jury (M (supra)). I see no reason to consider that it was necessary for the jury to have a reasonable doubt in those circumstances.  
      
       
        
       The application for leave to appeal against sentence 
        
       
     29 The learned trial judge was of the view that the factual material disclosed that the appellant had played a very significant role in the importation of the prohibited drug and was one of the principals of that importation. The quantity of the drug was substantial. His Honour found it had a street value of between $50,000 and $70,000. His Honour found a lack of remorse and considered the matters referred to in s.16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). His Honour applied the allowance provided for by s.16G of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). However, his Honour said:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""I am guided in my sentence by the case of  
         Regina v. Wong & Leung  
         [1999] NSWCCA 420."" 
         
        
       
     30 His Honour said at p.5 of his remarks on sentence, when dealing with that case:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""I am guided in my sentence by the case of  
         Regina v. Wong & Leung 
          [1999] NSWCCA 420 delivered on 30 July 1999 in which it was said that a general pattern of sentence for a case of drug importation where the quantity was between two grams and 200 grams should be in the range of five to seven years, where those involved were couriers or persons low in the hierarchy of the importation. 
         
        
        
         
         In this case, the quantity falls above the mid-level of that range, being 14.5 grams of pure cocaine. The prisoner's involvement however was something greater than one at the low level of hierarchy. In all of the circumstances, I have come to the view that an appropriate sentence is one of six years imprisonment."" 
         
        
       
     31 Thus it seems that his Honour applied the guidelines set out by this court in Regina v. Wong & Leung (1999) 108 A. Crim. R. 531 and in particular applied the pattern of sentences provided in that decision. His honour has had regard to the mid-level of the range referred to in that decision, when considering the quantities of drugs, and when he referred to general deterrence, and that in the context of profit, it appears to me that his Honour's sentence turned on his application of the decision in Wong & Leung (supra). 
      
       
     32 In Wong & Leung v. The Queen [2001] HCA 64, the High Court of Australia, by majority, allowed the appeal and set aside the order of the Court of Criminal Appeal, remitting both matters to this court for further hearing and determination conformably with the High Court's decision. It is sufficient to note that the High Court reached the conclusion that the guidelines set out in the judgment of this court were inconsistent with the proper application of s.16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), and hence the application by his Honour of those guidelines in this matter must be considered as being in error. 
      
       
     33 I would therefore grant leave to appeal against sentence. However, it remains to consider whether the court is of the opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe, is warranted in law and should have been passed. It is only if the court is of this view that the court is empowered to quash the sentence and pass another sentence in substitution for that imposed in the exercise of discretion by the trial judge: s.6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912; House v. The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504. 
      
       
     34 Even though three is error detected in the reasoning process of a trial judge, s.6(3) does not enable this court, much less require it, to interfere with the sentence unless it is of the view that a more lenient sentence should have been passed: Regina v. Astill (No. 2) (1992) 64 A. Crim. R. 289 per Sully, J. at 303 and Lee, AJ. at 304. 
      
       
     35 Should the court be of the view the same or a more severe sentence is warranted, it should not interfere (unless in the special restriction circumstances that are applicable to the latter case: see Neal v. The Queen (1982) 149 CLR 305). 
      
       
     36 In the present case, the unchallenged evidence and the verdict clearly establish a serious infringement of s.233B by the appellant, acting as a joint principal with Mr. Helou. There was imported a substantial quantity of prohibited drugs by a scheme involving the prior remission of funds overseas, and a technique of some sophistication. Further, the appellant was party to a concealment of the identities of those involved. The scheme plainly had the potential for considerable profit at the expense of the vulnerability of Australia's importing systems, and the potential of causing severe harm to the community. 
      
       
     37 There is no reason to doubt any of the factual findings of the trial judge, nor his application to those matters of s.16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). His Honour applied, as he was required to do., s.16G. 
      
       
     38 Notwithstanding this is the first time in custody, and the submission that the sentence should have been less, notwithstanding his particular subjective circumstances to which his Honour referred in his remarks on sentence and which included his age, his close knit family, the circumstances of his relationship with his girlfriend, and his avoidance of his earlier drug addiction, I am not persuaded that there should have been any sentence other than that originally imposed by the trial judge. 
      
       
     39 The trial judge took into account the prospects of the prisoner for the future, including the prospects of the prisoner's parents' health. The trial judge concluded, when applying the relevant criteria under s.16A, that those matters did not affect the appropriate level of sentence. I agree. 
      
       
     40 Having regard to all the subjective matters and the objective criminality and taking into account the various single instance decisions prior to Wong & Leung (1999) 108 A. Crim .R. 531 both of the courts of this State and of other courts of other States referred to in that decision at pp.547-555, I see no inconsistency in this sentence requiring correction, and indeed, in my view, it is the proper sentence, synthesising all relevant considerations. 
      
       
     41 I therefore have come to the view that the appropriate course to take is to dismiss the appeal. 
      
       
     42 The orders I propose are that leave to appeal against sentence be granted, but the appeal be dismissed. 
      
       
     43 SPIGELMAN, CJ: I agree. 
      
       
     44 SULLY, J: I too agree. 
      
       
     45 SPIGELMAN, CJ: Accordingly the orders are as indicated by Justice Greg James.

      REGINA v Dawin TAN 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
     1 HIDDEN J: The applicant, Dawin Tan, pleaded guilty in the District Court to two offences, one of aggravated robbery under s95(1) of the Crimes Act, 1900 and one of demand money by force with intent to steal, an offence under s99 of the Crimes Act. The first of those offences carries a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment and the second a maximum penalty of ten years. Latham DCJ sentenced him on the aggravated robbery charge to imprisonment for eight years to commence from the date he was taken into custody, with a non-parole period of five years. On the demand money charge her Honour sentenced him to imprisonment for a fixed term of four years, which was wholly concurrent with the non-parole period on the first charge. 
      
       
     2 The facts are adequately explained in her Honour's remarks on sentence as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         In short form the victim, a Hong Kong National female aged 36 who resided with her two sons and husband in a unit in Hurstville, was returning to her home at about 9.30am on 16 March 2000 having dropped her sons to a nearby school. She parked her vehicle in the garage assigned to her unit in the basement of the building and alighted from her vehicle whereupon she saw a white van stationary across her garage door. The prisoner and two unknown co-offenders left the vehicle, approached the victim and produced a knife whereupon the victim was told ""don't make any noise"". Both the prisoner and the co-offender wore stockings over their heads and it was the co-offender who on the facts before me, was armed with the knife. The victim was forced into the rear of the van by the prisoner and his co-offender and once inside, the victim was bound with masking tape around her eyes, ankles and wrists. The vehicle was then driven around the Hurstville area. Whilst being driven, the victim's handbag was searched by the prisoner and the co-offender in the back of the van. The van was then driven back to the victim's premises where the driver of the vehicle went to the victim's unit and opened the door with the keys which had been removed from the victim's handbag. Inside the unit the sum of $720 Australian and $100 Hong Kong was removed. The van containing the victim was once again driven from the premises. During the journey the prisoner and his co-offenders continually threatened the victim demanding money from her. Two key cards were removed from her wallet and she was questioned as to the contents of those accounts. She suppled her personal identification numbers in respect of two of those accounts and between 10 and 11 o'clock approximately that morning, 14 attempts were made by both the prisoner and his co-offenders on those two bank accounts. Four of those attempts were successful which resulted in a withdrawal of $1,960 from those two accounts. 
         
        
       
       
      
       
        
         
         Whilst all of this was occurring the victim was still being detained within the van. There was then an unsuccessful attempt to persuade the victim to extort money from an acquaintance of the victim. Failing that, she was questioned about monies that she may have had in any overseas accounts. The facts I have thus far related form the basis of the aggravated robbery charge. The following facts form the basis of the demand money with menaces charge. 
         
        
       
       
      
       
        
         
         The victim informed the prisoner and his co-offender that she had the sum of $10,000 in a Hong Kong account which she was unable to withdraw with less than 24 hours notice. One of the prisoner's co-offenders then informed the victim that she would be released in order to facilitate the withdrawal of that $10,000 from the account, on the basis that she would deliver the amount to them the following day. In the course of these demands one of the offenders said to the victim ""If you report to the police I will kill your son. I have taken your husband's photograph from your home so don't report it to the police"". There was a further period of time during which the van was driven throughout the Hurstville area before the masking tape was removed from the victim's wrists and ankles but not her eyes. She was then released from the van with her handbag and wallet and some short time later reported the matter to the police. 
         
        
       
       
      
       
        
         
         The following day, 17 March 2000, 19 further attempts were made to withdraw money from the bank accounts belonging to the victim. Only two of those attempts were successful which resulted in a withdrawal of $70 in cash. However at 11 o'clock on 17 March 2000 the victim did receive a telephone call from someone speaking in Cantonese who repeated the demand for the $10,000. A further phone call followed in relation to the demand seven minutes later and a further phone call that afternoon was made by the same caller at 3.58pm and 5.25pm. All of these calls were monitored and recorded pursuant to a listening device warrant. The arrangement ultimately was that the victim was to deposit $10,000 into a garbage bin under an umbrella at the Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet in Forest Road Hurstville. The victim complied with the demand insofar as she did place a plastic bag into a garbage bin which was the subject of surveillance at the time. Shortly before 6pm the prisoner was observed to enter the KFC restaurant where he remained without purchasing any item. He exited the store a short time later and attempted to retrieve the plastic bag from the bin whereupon he was arrested. When taken to Hurstville Police Station and interviewed in relation to the matter he made full admissions to the police which corresponded to the account given to the police by the victim. 
          
         
        
       
     3 Her Honour rightly described this behaviour as ""grave criminality"", calling for ""condign punishment"". In arriving at the effective sentence of eight years with a non-parole period of five years her Honour expressed herself to have regard to the totality of the applicant's criminality reflected in both offences. 
      
       
     4 The applicant pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and was committed to the District Court for sentence. As her Honour noted he cooperated with police making full admissions in a recorded interview. He is now twenty seven years old and has no prior convictions in this country. By way of explanation of the offences, there was evidence that he had a gambling problem which had led him to squandering some $20,000 of his wife's money. Her Honour referred to that material in passing sentence but expressed the view that it afforded no adequate explanation for criminality of this order. 
      
       
     5 Mr Fliece, Counsel for the applicant in this Court, has challenged the sentence in respect of the robbery charge asserting that it is manifestly excessive. He has also argued that her Honour failed to specify a discrete reduction of sentence for the applicant's pleas of guilty, submitting that she should have done so. 
      
       
     6 On the question of the sentence for the robbery charge, Mr Fliece took us to statistics published by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales for the period December 1994 to March 2000. Those figures show in respect of all offenders over that period that the present sentence of eight years is the highest recorded, as is her Honour's non-parole period of five years. That may in fact slightly misrepresent the position. Both figures are higher than any recorded figures in those statistics. 
      
       
     7 Figures of that kind are useful to sentencing courts and to courts of criminal appeal but, as has often been said, their value is somewhat limited. In the nature of things they tell us nothing about the circumstances of the cases, the results of which are recorded. This offence of robbery was a very serious example of that crime and one which, on any view of it, would call for a sentence very high in the range fairly available to a sentencing judge. In addition, it must be borne in mind, as I have said, that her Honour appears to have arrived at the total sentence and the non-parole period on the robbery charge with an eye to the criminality inherent in the second charge of demanding money with menaces or by force. That charge itself was a very serious example of that category of criminality.  
      
       
     8 Mr Fliece pressed his submission that the sentence on the robbery charge is excessive not only by reference to the Judicial Commission figures but also with regard to the favourable subjective case which the applicant was able to make out. He referred to the applicant's age, to his lack of prior convictions and to his gambling problem. He referred also to the applicant's early plea of guilty and to his co-operation with police. Her Honour, herself, referred to all those matters in her remarks on sentence without, as I have said, specifying any discrete discount in relation to any of them. In particular, her Honour referred to the early pleas, to their utilitarian value and to the fact that, in the circumstances of this case, they demonstrated contrition on the applicant's part. 
      
       
     9 Taking all those matters into account, I remain unpersuaded that the effective sentence imposed by her Honour is manifestly excessive. Certainly, the sentence is high but it was justly so. Both offences were of unusual seriousness, particularly the robbery offence to which the greater of the two sentences attached. 
      
       
     10 In the light of the High Court decision and, in particular, the joint judgment in that case, it does not appear to me that it could be said her Honour fell into error by not specifying a discount for the plea of guilty. Whether it remained open to her Honour to do so is a matter that does not need to be determined for the purposes of this case.  
      
       
     11 As I have said, Mr Fliece also argued that her Honour should have quantified the reduction in sentence to which the applicant was entitled by virtue of his pleas of guilty. In written submissions, Mr Fliece referred to the decision of this Court in R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. Those submissions no doubt were prepared before the very recent decision of the High Court in Wong and Leung v The Queen [2001] HCA 64. 
      
       
     12 I can say no more than that the effective sentence appears to me appropriate to reflect the criminality in this case and to give all due weight to the favourable subjective circumstances. 
      
       
     13 The matter is a very serious one and it was proper that this Court should examine these sentences. For that reason I would grant leave to appeal but I would dismiss the appeal. 
      
       
     14 NEWMAN AJ: I agree. 
      
       
     15 HIDDEN J: The orders of the Court will be as I proposed.

      ALEXANDER v HEISE & ANOR 
       
     The appellant appeals from a decision of Master Harrison, in which it was held that neither of the respondents breached their duties of care to the appellant’s late husband. The claim pursuant to the Compensation to Relatives Act 1897, arose out of the death of the appellant’s husband, Ted Alexander, on 22 March 1996 due to a cerebral haemorrhage. The appellant had attended at the first respondent’s surgery, he being a GP, and had organised an appointment for her husband. The second respondent was the first respondent’s receptionist and also his wife. The appellant’s husband had suffered an uncharacteristic and severe headache during the previous night and, as she was concerned for his health, she arranged an appointment for a full medical check up for the following week. The day before the appointment, however, the appellant found him unconscious and twelve days later he died of a grade V berry aneurism. The appellant argued that had her husband seen a doctor before he suffered the aneurism, his death could have been avoided.Held:Per Stein JA (Priestley JA and Ipp AJA agreeing):1) The receptionist was attempting to ascertain the duration and severity of the problem and assess its degree of seriousness. She was exercising her judgment. On the information provided by the appellant, Mrs Heise would have been able to make an assessment that the patient’s condition was not life threatening and that he was not in any pain or discomfort. It was perfectly understandable that she would not conclude that it was an urgent problem or that she needed to refer it immediately to Dr Heise. Accordingly there was no breach of duty on the part of the receptionist and it follows that there was no breach of duty by Dr Heise.

       Introduction 
       
     3 The appellant appeals from a finding of Master Harrison that neither of the respondents, Dr and Mrs Heise, breached their duties of care to the appellant’s late husband. The Master was hearing part of a claim by Mrs Alexander and her children under the Compensation to Relatives Act 1897. The claim arises out of the death of her husband, Ted Alexander, on 22 March 1996, due to a cerebral haemorrhage.  
      
       
     4 The appellant’s claim was that her husband’s death would have been prevented if he had been examined by a general practitioner, Dr Heise, the first respondent. The second respondent, Mrs Heise, was Dr Heise’s receptionist. They are husband and wife. 
      
       
     5 Abadee J had ordered that the Master determine whether the respondents or either of them, were under a duty of care in the circumstances, and if so, whether either of them had breached the duty. The Master found that both respondents were under a duty of care and this finding is the subject of the cross-appeal. She further found that neither of the respondents breached the duty of care. The appellant challenges this finding. 
      
       
        
       The factual context 
       
     6 The Alexander family moved to Cheltenham in July 1995 and the appellant selected Dr Heise’s surgery as the medical practice for the family. However, only the appellant had attended the practice by the 4 March 1996. 
      
       
     7 In February 1996 Mr Alexander told his wife that he had been suffering a few headaches and attributed them to use of a mobile phone. They were not severe and required no medication. In late February Mr Alexander suffered what was thought to be a virus with a temperature of 39. He refused to attend the hospital casualty department because he did not think he was sick enough to warrant medical opinion or treatment. 
      
       
     8 At around 2 am on Monday 4 March 1966 Mr Alexander woke up his wife and told her that he had a very bad headache which would not go away. He had taken two Panadol which had no effect. He asked for one of his wife’s migraine tablets. She gave him one Mersyndol tablet, an over-the-counter product. Mr Alexander took it, returned to bed and subsequently fell asleep. The appellant saw this conduct of her husband as out of character and it was of great concern to her. 
      
       
     9 The next morning the appellant told her husband that she would make an appointment for him to have a full medical examination. He agreed to this but requested an appointment as late as possible in the evening so as not to interfere with his busy architectural practice. He also needed to travel from his workplace in the city to the surgery at Thornleigh. 
      
       
     10 That morning Mr Alexander appeared to be well, apparently had no headache and went to work as usual. The appellant said in evidence that ‘he did not appear to be sick’ and that ‘he was fine’. 
      
       
     11 The appellant herself had an appointment at 6 pm with Dr Ginger, who was a member of the same practice group as Dr Heise. The appellant believed that her husband would want to see a male doctor so she did not mention anything to Dr Ginger. After her consultation she attended to the bill and spoke to Mrs Heise, the receptionist, to make an appointment for her husband. The appointment was made for 6.45 pm on Monday 11 March 1996, one week later. 
      
       
     12 Between 4 and 10 March 1996 Mr Alexander appeared to be in good health. However, on 10 March the appellant found him unconscious on the bed at home. Twelve days later he died of a grade V berry aneurism. The appellant’s case was that if Mr Alexander had seen a doctor during the week, his death could have been avoided. 
      
       
        
       The crucial conversation 
       
     13 Clearly the crucial part of the case is what was said between the appellant and Mrs Heise at 6.30 pm or so on 4 March 1996. There were two versions given in evidence which, in material respects, were diametrically opposed. For example, the appellant said that she told Mrs Heise that her husband had had a severe uncharacteristic headache in the early hours of the morning. On the other hand, Mrs Heise denied that Mrs Alexander mentioned any headache. The Master essentially accepted the appellant’s account of what was said and rejected much of what Mrs Heise maintained was said. 
      
       
     14 The court must, of course, determine the appeal on the basis of the Master’s findings of what was said in the conversation. That this is so is confirmed by the parties not challenging the Master’s findings of fact, except in one minor respect which I will mention later. 
      
       
     15 The Master found that in seeking to make an appointment for her husband the appellant informed the receptionist of the following. Her husband had had such a severe headache in the early hours of the morning and this was so out of character that he had asked her for a migraine tablet. Secondly, that she wanted him to have a full medical check-up because the headache may have been related to stress at work. Thirdly, she wanted him to have a blood test for prostrate cancer. The Master added that it was likely that the appellant would have repeated that she was worried about her husband’s headache because she accepted the appellant’s evidence that Mrs Heise asked how he was that morning. The Master found that Mrs Alexander replied ‘he did not appear sick and was able to go to work this morning’. 
      
       
     16 The Master said that Mrs Alexander did not stipulate to Mrs Heise that an appointment had to be by the end of the week but likely said ‘as soon as possible’. This finding is challenged by the respondents and it is clear from the appellant’s evidence that she accepted that she did not ask for an appointment ‘as soon as possible’ but rather ‘some time this week’. Counsel for the appellant accepts this. 
      
       
     17 I should add to this that the appellant agreed that she did not express any urgency to Mrs Heise about the appointment since her husband was ‘fine’ that morning. 
      
       
     18 The Master rejected Mrs Heise’s evidence that she offered appointments for the Wednesday or Friday evening or that she would let the appellant know if there were any cancellation. It is plain that the appellant had no reason to be unsatisfied with the appointment she had made for her husband for 11 March.19 From the above recounted findings a number of matters may be emphasised. First, Mrs Heise was dealing with Mrs Alexander and not Mr Alexander. The patient himself was not present nor did he contact the surgery. 
      
       
     20 Second, from the Master’s findings it is apparent that the appellant did not tell the receptionist a number of relevant matters about her husband. They are as follows: 
      
       
        
       . That he had taken two Panadol tablets with no effect before taking the Mersyndol. 
        
       
       
       . That in February he had reported to the appellant that he had suffered a few headaches. 
        
        
       . That in late February he had probably suffered a viral condition with a temperature of 39 but sought no treatment.  
        
        
       . That his family had a history of aneurism, although it is not clear that Mrs Alexander was necessarily aware of this. 
        
       
     21 It was the task of the receptionist, Mrs Heise, to prioritise the appointment. It was clearly not an emergency and Mrs Alexander accepted this. Should the receptionist have concluded that Mr Alexander needed to be seen that day or urgently, or should she have telephoned Dr Heise to ask his advice about when to make an appointment? 
      
       
     22 Senior Counsel for the appellant submits that once the appellant had indicated to Mrs Heise that her husband had suffered a severe uncharacteristic headache, that should have caused her to telephone Dr Heise. In failing to do so he submits that she breached her duty of care. 
      
       
     23 Reliance was placed, in particular, on Mrs Heise’s response to a question in cross-examination.24 Mrs Heise was asked: 
      
       
        
         
         … if the person had come in, as Mrs Alexander says she did, and said this, “I want to make an appointment for my husband, Ted. I’m extremely worried about him as he woke up in the early hours of this morning with such a severe headache that he has asked me for one of my migraine tablets. I can’t tell you how out of character it is for him to take any medication. He has been working so hard and he has been under such a lot of stress lately”, … you would have … immediately contacted your husband on the other end of the telephone to say, “You had better come and deal with this potential medical emergency”, … 
         
        
       
     25 Her answer was in the affirmative, although she disputed that Mrs Alexander had used those words. 
      
       
     26 However, it is plain that what was put to Mrs Heise, which elicited her agreement, was not the whole of what the Master found was said by Mrs Alexander in the relevant conversation. Importantly, indeed critically, it omitted the appellant’s answer to Mrs Heise’s question as to how her husband was that morning. As I have mentioned, this elicited, according to the Master, an answer which indicated that her husband was well, in fact ‘fine’, had no headache and went to work as usual. 
      
       
     27 It follows in my view that Mrs Heise’s agreement to the question referred to above does not assist the appellant. If the whole of what the Master found was said by the appellant was put, including what appears in the paragraph immediately above, Mrs Heise’s answer may have been quite different. 
      
       
     28 Reliance was also placed by the appellant on the report of Dr Eric Fisher in which the following was said: 
      
       
        
         
         I consider that if Mrs Heise did receive a history that Mr Alexander had woken up in the early hours of the morning with a severe headache and asking uncharacteristically for Mrs Alexander’s migraine tablets as outlined in paragraph 11 of Mrs Alexander’s statement, she should have spoken to her husband concerning the problem. 
         
        
       
     29 However, this suffers from the same deficiency. The opinion is given without consideration of the effect of the deceased being well after he woke in the morning without a headache and was able to go to work normally. 
      
       
     30 Further, if one considers the ‘guidelines’ in the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners Handbook for Medical Receptionists, Mrs Heise was clearly attempting to ascertain the duration and severity of the problem and assess its degree of seriousness. She was exercising her judgment. She knew that the headache had been severe and uncharacteristic and took place around 2 am. She was told that it responded to the taking of a Mersyndol tablet and that Mr Alexander went back to sleep. She was told that the headache had resolved in the morning after Mr Alexander had awoken and that he was then well and went to work as usual. 
      
       
     31 On the information that she was given by the appellant, Mrs Heise would have been able to make an assessment that the patient’s condition was not life threatening and that he was in no pain or discomfort. In those circumstances, it would be perfectly understandable that she would not conclude that it was an urgent problem to be dealt with by a doctor that day or that she needed to refer it immediately to Dr Heise before making the appointment for one week later. 
      
       
     32 On this analysis, there was no breach of duty on the part of the receptionist. She was not obliged to consult with the doctor in the circumstances of the Master’s findings as to what transpired. It follows that there was also no breach of duty by Dr Heise. 
      
       
     33 In my opinion, the Master did not err in finding that there was no negligence by Mrs Heise. Accordingly, the appeal should be dismissed. 
      
       
     34 The respondents’ cross-appeal against the findings by the Master of the existence of a duty of care on each of them. In light of the conclusion that the Master was not in error in finding that neither respondent breached their duty of care, it is unnecessary to address the cross-appeal. All that I would say is that it is my opinion that both Dr Heise and Mrs Heise (as his receptionist) owed duties of care to the deceased. The scope and content of their duties may be debatable but they are unnecessary to determine on this appeal. 
      
       
     35 I would propose the following orders: 
      
       
       
       1. Appeal dismissed with costs. 
        
        
       2. Cross-appeal dismissed with costs. 
        
       
     36 IPP AJA: I agree with Stein JA.

      REGINA v. SAID NAJIBULLAH AKBARY 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
     1 HIDDEN, J: We are in a position to give judgment. 
      
       
     2 GREG JAMES, J: Said Najibullah Akbary seeks leave to appeal against sentence imposed upon him on a count of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon, an offence under s.97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 punishable by a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. He pleaded guilty to that offence and at the time it was dealt with sought that the trial judge take into account another offence of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon on a Form 1. The offence on the indictment was said to have been committed on 16 October 2000, that on the Form 1 on 7 September 2000. 
      
       
     3 He pleaded guilty in circumstances, which revealed that he had a lack of recollection, no doubt due to his mental state and also to having ingested drugs and alcohol. But he retained sufficient recollection so as not only to have confessed to one of crimes to the police, but also so that when he gave evidence before the learned trial judge he was able to refer, to some extent, to what he believes must have happened. 
      
       
     4 He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of four years six months to date from 16 October 2000. The trial judge expressed that sentence in this way:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""I sentence the prisoner to four and a half years imprisonment. I find special circumstances that enable me to fix a minimum term of two and a half years and an additional term of two years."" 
         
        
       
     5 His Honour backdated the sentence to the date on which the offender went into custody, that is, 16 November 2000. His Honour expressed that as meaning that the non-parole period would date from 16 October 2000 and run to 15 April 2003. His Honour said:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""And the additional term of two years during which the prisoner will be eligible for parole will date from 16 April 2003 to 15 April 2005."" 
         
        
       
     6 It is apparent his Honour has used terms relating to the different sentencing regimes that applied in this State both before and after the passing of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Nonetheless, the effect of the sentence is quite clear and that is, taking into account the form one offence, his Honour passed a total sentence of four and a half years including a non-parole period of two years six months. That means that the offender would be eligible to be released on parole after serving in actual custody two and a half years although that release would not be automatic. 
      
       
     7 His Honour referred, after hearing evidence from the offender, to the offender's extensive record and to the device, whether meat cleaver or meat hammer with which one of the offences was committed. He set out how, on 16 October 2000, the offender had, armed with that device, demanded money and cigarettes from a shopkeeper and caused some considerable degree of terror in those present. His Honour concluded that the armed robbery was not particularly well planned nor was it planned over a substantial period of time. Indeed, the offender had left a psychiatric hospital, Cumberland Hospital, only a comparatively short time before the robbery was committed. His Honour referred to the unfortunate prior history of the offender, which contains numerous offences. These include offences of robbery of shopkeepers when armed with a knife. The offender had been in custody on many occasions the record discloses. The present offence indeed occurred only about five weeks after a similar event which had given rise to the offence described on the Form 1. 
      
       
     8 The psychiatric material that was tendered, including from Dr. Brian Boucher and Dr. Bruce Westmore, as well as the Probation and Parole report of 11 May 2001 from Mr. Chris Simons, all showed that it was not surprising that the prisoner would have had the defect in memory to which he has referred. 
      
       
     9 The psychiatric history set out in those reports demonstrates that the prisoner has a serious mental illness which mental illness would require that special attention be given to a sentence, which will not contain so much emphasis on matters of general or special deterrence as might otherwise be the case. In the context of the prisoner's prior record, notwithstanding that record may well have been contributed to by the effect of the illness and by the effect of the prisoner's self-medication from polydrug, abuse the sentence was, in my opinion, as lenient as it could be consistent with the authorities binding upon us. His Honour, the trial judge, appears to me to have made, in that regard, no error. 
      
       
     10 The grounds of appeal asserted are that the sentences should have been mitigated as the offences were committed whilst under the influence of alcohol and drugs. That they were so committed might be conceded. Further, it might be conceded that this is one of those exceptional cases referred to by Wood, CJ. at CL. in the guideline judgment in Regina v. Henry (1999) 106 A. Crim. R. 149 where the resort to drug and alcohol does operate to mitigate somewhat the penalty that might otherwise be imposed since it was not a chosen lifestyle to resort to those drugs but one to which the prisoner may well have been driven by his mental illness. 
      
       
     11 The appellant, in a letter dated 20 October 2001 referred to the circumstances in which he is detained as a forensic patient and before us today has referred to those circumstances. What he has told us has been received from him, without objection by the Crown to us being given that material in that form. He says that he is detained for up to 22 hours in his cell and on protection. These matters give rise to considerations of how onerous his sentence has become for him having regard to the incidence in him of the disease. Notwithstanding those matters, he says he has completed numerous courses successfully in gaol including relating to his own ability to handle his illness. He has now accepted his diagnosis of mental illness, he shows a degree of insight and is now drug free. He accepts that he had, until recently, rejected the diagnosis and turned to drugs and submits that his crimes, both past crimes and present crimes, arise only in that context. 
      
       
     12 Nonetheless, notwithstanding the power of these submissions and his desire to be given a fair go and a second chance to lead a normal productive life, this court sits only as a court to review error rather than a court which sentences itself in the absence of detected error below. For an application for leave to appeal against sentence to succeed it is necessary to demonstrate that the trial judge fell into legal error. All the matters to which the prisoner has referred, including the circumstances of the prisoner being on protection, the circumstances of the onerous features of the prisoner's confinement, the significance of his gaining insight into his problem and indeed the very reference to what Justice Wood said in Henry (supra) were taken into account by the trial judge. And, his Honour took into account the fact that the offender was suffering from a mental illness or disability, which would mitigate his culpability. 
      
       
     13 Nonetheless, it is binding law upon us that although the considerations of general deterrence might be substantially diminished by such factors, that is not to provide a licence for the commission of offences by offenders who are not so mentally ill as not to be responsible for their actions. Consequently, I am unable to see that there is any error would which warrant this court's interference with the course taken by the trial judge. 
      
       
     14 It will, therefore, be necessary, since the matter has been fully argued, to grant leave to appeal but in my view the appeal should be dismissed. 
      
       
     15 Before leaving it, however, I consider that the reports which have been provided to us with the papers and a copy of this judgment should be provided to the Corrective Services Commission with a view to them having regard to the matters referred to in them in the hope that appropriate steps might be taken, if it is at all possible or feasible, to ameliorate the conditions under which the prisoner is serving his sentence and so that those matters he has advanced might be considered by the Parole Board when it comes to the question of granting him release once the non-parole period of his sentence has expired. 
      
       
     16 HIDDEN J: I agree. The orders of the court will be those proposed by Greg James, J.

    70062/00 - REGINA v Cherdchai PHOMARANUPHONG 
     
      
    Judgment 
     
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The accused, Cherdchai Phomaranuphong, was indicted on a charge of murder. On 1 December 2000, Barr J found him unfit to be tried. On 9 July 2001, the Mental Health Review Tribunal determined that the accused would not become fit to be tried for the offence, within twelve months of the finding of unfitness. 
     
      
    2 Having regard to these matters, the Attorney-General directed a special hearing be conducted in accordance with s 18 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990. 
     
      
    3 The accused has elected that the special hearing be conducted by a judge alone. In a separate judgment I determined that before making this election the accused had sought and received advice from his solicitor. 
     
      
    4 There has been tendered before me thirty-four statements from various persons. They include the transcript of a phone call to the emergency 000 number and a record of interview. There was no objection to the tender of any of this evidence. 
     
      
    5 The evidence discloses that on Friday, 24 December 1999 between 9 am and 10 am on that morning, the accused, aged twenty-five years, took a large knife from the kitchen of his home at unit 82/333 Bulwarra Road, Ultimo and went to the bathroom of the premises. In the bathroom he stabbed his girlfriend, Vachiraporn Punpanishku, (known as Fon), aged twenty-seven years, numerous times to the neck, chest and abdomen. As a result of her injuries she died. 
     
      
    6 At 10.03 am on that Friday, Mr Davison, an emergency telephone operator received a call from the accused. In a conversation the accused admitted killing his girlfriend. After being asked by the operator what the problem was the following conversation occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “Accused: Could you come to get me, please. 
        
       
       
        
        Operator: What’s the problem? 
        
       
       
        
        Accused: Just come, please 
        
       
       
        
        Operator: No, what’s the problem? I don’t just send the police cause people ring up. I need you to find out what the problem … 
        
       
       
        
        Accused: Yes, I just kill my girlfriend. 
        
       
       
        
        Operator: Just what? 
        
       
       
        
        Accused: I just killed my girlfriend 
        
       
       
        
        Operator: How long ago? 
        
       
       
        
        Accused: Please. 
        
       
       
        
        Operator: When did this happen? 
        
       
       
        
        Accused: Just 1 hour.” 
        
       
      
    7 There was further conversation between the operator and the accused as they awaited the arrival of police and ambulance at the accused’s home. At 10.20 am Acting Sergeant Napier attended the accused’s address with three ambulance officers. The accused opened the door to his unit. As he did so he held out his arms, as if to be handcuffed. At this time there was blood on the front of the accused’s coat, which was a pink coloured shave coat. The officer said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Officer: What has happened? 
        
       
       
        
        Accused: I killed my girlfriend. 
        
       
       
        
        Officer: Where is she? 
        
       
       
        
        Accused: In the bathroom. 
        
       
       
        
        Officer: Where is the bathroom? 
        
       
       
        
        Accused: Down the end of the hall.” 
        
       
      
    8 The accused then provided a coin to the officer saying that the coin would be needed to unlock the bathroom door. 
     
      
    9 Ambulance officers gained entry to the bathroom. Upon opening the door the deceased was found lying on her back on the bathroom floor. She had multiple stab wounds to her chest and abdomen. She was naked, although partly covered with a towel. After removing the towel, the deceased’s bowel could be seen protruding. A knife was also found in the bathroom basin. 
     
      
    10 Shortly after 10.40 am Det O’Brien attended the scene. He was introduced to the accused, who had been placed under arrest and cautioned. Det O’Brien asked the accused what he had done: 
     
      
       
        
        “Accused: I kill her 
        
       
       
        
        Officer: How? 
        
       
       
        
        Accused: By knife, kitchen knife. 
        
       
       
        
        Officer: When? 
        
       
       
        
        Accused: About 9.30 am 
        
       
       
        
        Officer: Why? 
        
       
       
        
        Accused: Why, okay why because I can’t see her because of someone else. I don’t know what she wants to do to me. I got filthy and can’t think. She talk nice to me and she rude to me. I don’t know what happened. I tell her I do anything and she ran away last night and she want to kill by herself a long time ago so I don’t want that. I want to go to Brisbane to Mount Coot-tha. We start love together in that place, I want to go that place by myself by tomorrow or tonight. I want to in my mind. And I don’t know she knows everything, she talks, talks. I think I headache, she hit me last night. I did do anything to her, she hit me and she used her hands to try to kill me her hand to my neck.” 
        
       
      
    11 When speaking to the accused, the police became aware that he appeared injured. Ambulance officers attended him and found that he had sixteen scratch marks on his abdomen. He also had scratched into his abdomen, the deceased’s name “FON”. As a result of his injuries, the accused was taken to St Vincent’s Hospital. 
     
      
    12 On 25 December 1999, Dr Botterill conducted a post mortem on the deceased. He found that the cause of death to be multiple stab wounds to the neck, chest and abdomen. There was also damage to the left lung, the right side of the heart, the liver, the stomach, bowel and the bottom of the right kidney with collections of blood in the chest and belly cavities. Examination of the brain showed generalised pallor consistent with acute blood loss. There were nineteen stab wounds in total. 
     
      
    13 The knife recovered at the scene was a Kiwi Brand wooden handled knife 27.5 cm in length with a 16 cm blade and an 11.5 cm handle. The knife had blood and hair on both sides. 
     
      
    14 Inquiries with neighbours revealed that sounds of screaming had been heard coming from the accused’s premises. A witness, Mrs Wei-Yhi Liou, aged thirty-two years, who lived at 76/333 Bulwarra Road, Ultimo said that about 9 am on 24 December 1999 she awoke and could hear screaming of a woman coming from an apartment above hers. This lasted in her estimation, about five to six minutes. The woman was repeating two words and did so about five to six times. The screaming was very loud. This witness took no action. She fell asleep and woke up about 11 am. 
     
      
    15 Her husband, Chang Chiang Wang, recalls that between 9 am to 10 am he heard the sound of screaming. He said the screaming sounded like a woman and the screaming lasted for approximately one minute. 
     
      
    16 The deceased moved to Australia from Thailand in 1996. By 1998 she was in a relationship with the accused. The deceased and the accused moved together to Sydney from Queensland in about January 1999. 
     
      
    17 In early December 1999, the accused travelled to Thailand, but had returned by 20 December 1999. By this time the deceased had informed the accused that she wanted to end her relationship with him. 
     
      
    18 About 12 midnight on 20 December 1999, Sineenat Khantaracha (known as Kay) received a phone call from the deceased. During that conversation she heard the sound of something smashing and she heard the accused saying, “Fon, calm down. Don’t do this to me. Please don’t do this.” This witness then spoke to the accused who said “Fon not calmed down, she is upset.” There was further conversation and she heard the accused saying, “Fon don’t leave me.” 
     
      
    19 The accused was interviewed by police at St Vincents Hospital on the night of the offence. The interview was recorded on audiotape. Present at the time of the interview was a Thai interpreter. 
     
      
    20 When asked during the interview what occurred on this morning, the accused indicated that he woke up and spoke to the deceased. He said that in a conversation, the deceased said to him. “Tonight when I come back home I don’t want to see you. Wherever you want to go just go, I don’t care.” The accused also said that the previous night the deceased had told him that she wanted to go and stay with a friend. He said that on this morning, after a conversation with the deceased, he said to her: 
     
      
       
        
        “If you need some breakfast I can make for you. She didn’t answer me, she didn’t give me, answer anything, she just, I just take her to the bathroom and she just put me – she just put me out. Ok. I just out and I asked go in again and I asked her, don’t be like this, please give me one more chance. I don’t know what I did, please tell me. Give me one more chance. She just say, no, no. And I don’t know I very confusing. If she say something like this, no more share, why she come back, if she just talk nice to me, just come to stay with me, that way, she just do something like this. I don’t know what she want, you know.” 
        
       
      
    21 When asked what happened when he was in the bathroom, he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In bathroom, ok. She push me, push me, go away, go away, I want to, I want to, I want to die, right. She say I want to die. No Fon, die better, I can’t see you die. Ok you say to me if I go somewhere else I go you don’t care me any more, I go and she say, Ok bye.” 
        
       
      
    22 He further said: 
     
      
       
        
        “She said in this life we two cannot love each other. If we die, after we’ve died the next life when we come back together we will be boyfriend and girlfriend again she said. I just go in and take a knife, get to the bathroom and she saw the knife, she just … a little bit, run, run, I just Ok come now, I don’t want to do like that. Just kill me.” 
        
       
      
    23 He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “She try to get the knife, I don’t want to but she just pulls the knife, I just pulled back, she just pulled back. 
        
       
       
        
        We try to struggle for the, each was trying to struggle for the knife, but and then I fell, like, the knife has hit something substantial but I didn’t see that. 
        
       
       
        
        She shout out loudly between the shower and the sink she was falling down and I saw that the knife was stuck into her tummy but the knife was within my hand. She said kill, kill, kill me now. I saw the blood. 
        
       
       
        
        At the time she was falling down and I thought of the words she said that in this life we will not be living together and in the next life we will be living together.” 
        
       
      
    24 When asked what happened when he had the knife in his hand and she fell down, the accused said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Kill me, you will kill me. I just hold the knife right, and she just hold my hand and said …. .” 
        
       
      
    25 He went on to say he saw her guts gushing out. He said that he tried to stab himself but he couldn’t get through. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I think she was trying to say to me, kill me. I will not cry, I will go first and you follow me. She try to get the knife from me, now she falling down, I sitting down. She try to get the knife, I don’t want to give it to her and I thought she going die, no one help her, I tried to … myself again … .” 
        
       
      
    26 He also said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I just take the knife right, she want to die, I take the knife.” 
        
       
      
    27 He went on to indicate he stabbed the deceased in an area near the heart. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “She pointed to her neck she was, her hands were trembling as if pointing to her neck, grabbing my hand. I was holding the knife and I had such a tremendous headache I didn’t know what to do. She grabbed my hand with the knife and she was pointing the knife towards her neck as if asking me to stab on the neck as if to say I will not survive anyway, don’t let me suffer on. I did it, I stabbed, I stabbed twice on the neck.” 
        
       
      
    28 He continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “I felt that I was sinful at the time, I committed a sin. I killed someone whom I love. I tried to use the knife to stab myself and then I thought it wouldn’t help if I die also but I would repay this sin which I have committed by calling the police and then I will repay this debt in a better way. I will use by remaining life to do good towards the end when I will follow her. I think that will make her go to heaven. 
        
       
       
        
        I don’t know what she was thinking but she told me that she wanted to go to stay with a friend then she said, we can still be friends but we can’t be living together because of my parents 
        
       
      
    29 He was asked “How did that make you feel?” He answered: 
     
      
       
        
        “I’m hurt, I was hurt. Don’t’ know why because, she got back with me and live with me last night and morning, she still saying I will go. We can’t getting married because … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Earlier when Det O’Brien asked you a question you said that you felt shocked. Could you just explain a bit further as to what you mean by that? 
         
        A. I cannot take the fact that for one moment she wanted to return to me and for another moment she would say she needs to leave me. I cannot accept that fact. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You also said that when you asked her could you contact her and she said that you couldn’t, is that true? You’re nodding our head to indicate yes. 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Could you tell me how that made you feel? 
         
        A. I have nothing left in my life. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did it make you feel angry towards Fon? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did it make you feel? 
         
        A. Lonely, it made me feel lonely, alone. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you not want to feel alone? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you were in the bathroom and you were talking to Fon and she told you that you couldn’t contact her, did you go to the kitchen and get the knife? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Where did you get the knife from? 
         
        A. From the kitchen. After she pushed me and chased me outside of the residence and told me, don’t come back and let me see our face again. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. If you’d like a drink that’s Ok, just reach down by all means. At that point when she’d chased you out of the flat as you say did she then go back to have a shower? 
         
        A. I don’t know. I don’t know 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did you do then? 
         
        A. I just walked through to the bathroom again. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Ok and when you walked back into the bathroom was Fon already in the bathroom then? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Whereabouts in the bathroom was she then? 
         
        A. She, she’s between, I’m not sure. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. She wasn’t in the shower at that point was she? 
         
        A. No, no. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you back in there is it at that point you already had the knife? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why did you go into the bathroom with the knife? 
         
        A. Because I wanted to talk her, I want to kill myself in front of her because … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You wanted to kill yourself in front of her? Why did you want to do that? 
         
        A. I told you … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Would you like me to repeat the question? 
         
        A. Just, ok, we got, I got nothing left in my life. That why I just think things like that.” 
        
       
      
    30 Later in the interview he was asked this question: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You told us that her parents did not want you to see her. Can you tell us why her parents did not want her to see you? 
         
        A. Yes, that’s because I’ve already got a son but she has indicated to me that she would choose me whatever has happened before.” 
        
       
      
    31 The accused was shown the knife recovered by police and identified it as the weapon he used. When asked where he got it from he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “From the kitchen. After she pushed me and chased outside of the residence and told me, don’t come back and let me see your face again.” 
        
       
      
    32 The accused, at one point, said that after this he walked through to the bathroom where Fon was. At this time he had the knife. When asked why he went to the bathroom, the accused said: “Because I wanted to talk her, I want to kill myself in front of her.” 
     
      
    33 He was asked this question: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Before you stabbed her did you know within yourself that by stabbing her with the knife it would probably kill her. 
         
        A. I did know.” 
        
       
      
    34 When asked if it was his intention to kill the deceased when he stabbed her the accused said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Yes but I had no choice. The only thing I thought of was when she dies I will die also and then we’ll be able to live together and I know that by stabbing her I’m wrong. That was why I called the police. Come and get me.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    35 From this evidence it is plain, beyond any doubt, that the accused killed the deceased when he stabbed her in the bathroom of their residence on the morning of 24 December 1999. 
     
      
    36 However, the accused submits I should find him not guilty by reason of mental illness as provided by s 38 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990. It was conceded by the Crown that such a finding was open, it being submitted that there is a body of evidence which, if accepted, clearly indicates that at the relevant time, the accused was suffering from a disease of the mind that deprived him of the capacity to know the nature and quality of his act, or if he did, that what he was doing was wrong. 
     
      
    37 Notwithstanding this concession, the accused bears the onus of satisfying the court on the balance of probabilities (R v Ayoub (1984) 2 NSWLR 511) that at the time of the killing he was mentally ill, within the meaning of s 38 of the Act, so as not to be responsible, in law, for his actions. 
     
      
    38 The legislative provision embodies the common law concept in the M’Naghten Rules, according to which a person is not held criminally liable or responsible for his or her act which would otherwise be a crime if, at the time of committing that act, by reason of a disease of the mind, he or she did not know the nature and quality of the act or, if he or she did know it, he or she did not know that that act was wrong. R v M’Naghten (1843) 4 State Trials NS847. 
     
      
    39 In the present case, it is accepted that the accused knew the nature and quality of his actions which killed the deceased. However, the submission which is made is that the evidence would satisfy the court on, the balance of probabilities, that, by reason of a disease of the mind, the accused did not, at the time of his actions, know that they were wrong. 
     
      
    40 The test to be applied in determining these issues was considered by Badgery-Parker J in R v Gomaa, unreported, NSWSC, 27 April 1994, where his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The test embodied in the second branch of the M’Naghten Rules is as there stated deceptively simple: per Dixon J, Sodeman v The King (1936) 55 CLR 192 at 215. His Honour said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘When a derangement of the mind manifests itself only intermittently and in acts of passion, frenzy or the like, the question whether the party accused labours under such a disease of the mind that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong may well provoke in response two further questions - 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          namely, what is meant by ‘know’ and, at what stage in the course of his progress towards the commission of the acts charged must capacity to know cease? In general it may be correctly said that, if the disease or mental derangement so governs the faculties that it is impossible for the party accused to reason with some moderate degree of calmness in relation to the moral quality of what he is doing, he is prevented from knowing that what he does is wrong … The conditions of irresponsibility must exist at the time when the prisoner commits the acts with which he is charged.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Knowledge that an act is wrong is not the same as knowledge that the act is against the law: Stapleton v The Queen (1952) 86 CLR 358, where the opinion of the judges in M’Naghten’s case is extensively discussed. At 67 of the joint judgment the court said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘A case of this description must turn very largely upon the jury’s appreciation of what amounts to knowledge of the nature and quality of the act and of its wrongness. For it is evidence that a jury although satisfied that no capacity existed in a particular accused to reason at all may think that at the back of it all was an awareness of the nature of the act and of the fact that other people might regard it as wrong more especially if that means regarded by the law as wrong. That would not lead to a conviction if the jury understands that, given a disease, disorder or defect of reason, then it is enough if it so governed the faculties at the time of the commission of the act that the accused was incapable of reasoning with some moderate degree of calmness as to the wrongness of the act or of comprehending the nature or significance of the act of killing.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The court approved the terms in which Dixon J had explained to a jury the second branch of the M’Naghten Rules in the course of his summing up in R v Porter (1933) 55 CLR 182. It is worth quoting a more extensive portion of the summing up than was extracted by the court in Stapleton: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The other head is of quite a different character, namely, that his disease or disorder or disturbance of mind was of such a character that he was unable to appreciate that the act he was doing was wrong. It is supposed that he knew he was killing, knew how he was killing and knew why he was killing, but that he was quite incapable of appreciating the wrongness of the act. That is the issue, the real question in this case. Was his state of mind of that character? I have used simple expressions, but when you are dealing with the unseen workings of the mind you have to come to close quarters with what you are speaking about, and it is very difficult to be quite clear as to what is meant in describing mental conditions. I have used the expression ‘disease, disorder or disturbance of the mind.’ That does not mean … that there must be some physical deterioration of the cells of the brain … you are dealing with a very different thing – with the understanding. It does mean that the functions of the understanding are through some cause, whether understandable or not, thrown into derangement or disorder. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Then I have used the expression ‘know’, ‘knew that what he was doing was wrong’. We are dealing with one particular thing, the act of killing, the act of killing at a particular time, a particular individual. We are not dealing with right or wrong in the abstract. The question is whether he was able to appreciate the wrongness of the particular act he was doing at the particular time. Could this man be said to know in this sense whether his act was wrong if through a disease or defect or disorder of the mind He could not think rationally of the reasons which to ordinary people make that act right or wrong. If through the disordered condition of the mind he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong. What is meant by wrong? What is meant by wrong is wrong having regard to the everyday standards of reasonable people. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          If you think that at the time when he administered the poison to the child he had such a mental disorder or disturbance or derangement that he was incapable of reasoning about the right or wrongness, according to ordinary standards, of the thing which he was doing, not that he reasoned wrongly, or that being a responsible person he had queer or unsound ideas, but that he was quite incapable of taking into account the considerations which go to make right or wrong, then you should find him not guilty upon the ground that he was insane at the time he committed the acts charged.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        In Regina v Matheis (1958) 58 SR 321, The Court of Criminal Appeal held that there was no obligation upon a judge to direct a jury in the terms used by Dixon J in Porter and in particular it was not obligatory to direct the jury that ‘if through some disease or disorder of the mind the applicant was incapable of reasoning with some moderate degree of calmness as to the wrongness of the act of killing the jury could take the view that he did not know that his act as wrong.’ Nevertheless, trial judges were urged to pay close heed to the form of summing up in Porter’s case. In R v Matusevich and Thompson (1976) VR 470, the court considered how this concept ought be explained to a jury and said at 476 ‘The jury ought to have been told at least that they should address their minds to the question whether Thompson was able to appreciate the wrongness of the particular act he was doing at the particular time. They might well have been told that if, through the disordered condition of his mind, he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure, he could not ‘know’ that what he was doing was wrong. There may be many different ways of explaining to the jury the conceptual difficulties involved in a disordered mind ‘knowing’ that an act is wrong, but the language which we have adopted from Dixon J’s charge in R v Porter (1933) 55 CLR 182 at 189-190 has for long been accepted as a practical synthesis of the ideas involved. It must be admitted that it is difficult to contemplate any man, even if legally sane, being in a position, during the commission of a crime of great violence, to reason with a moderate degree of sense and composure or with a moderate degree of calmness as to the wrongness of his act. But the explanation based upon Porter’s case is directed to the capacity to reason of a mind affected by a mental disorder; it alerts the jury to the problem and it is sanctioned by high authority. Further, in this case, where there was evidence of actions on the part of Thompson from which the jury might infer that he was not insane, it would have been prudent to warn the jury of the danger of testing the defence of insanity by the kind of reasoning which a sane person would employ: see R v Weise (1969) VR 953 at 961 per Barry J. See also Mizzi v R (1960) 105 CLR 659.” 
        
       
       
        
        As these cases show, the tendency since Porter has been to focus on the issue of ability to reason with a moderate degree of sense and composure, rather than on the words used by Dixon J in the preceding sentence, ‘could not think rationally of the reasons which to ordinary people make that act right or wrong.’ 
        
       
       
        
        At the time of the important High Court decisions to which reference has been made above (Porter, Sodeman and Stapleton) the partial defence of diminished responsibility (partial in the sense that although the defence when established entitles the accused to be acquitted of murder, it does not secure an outright acquittal – he or she is still liable to conviction of manslaughter) did not form part of the law of New South Wales. It was introduced in England in 1957 and in this State in 1974. As was pointed out by Hunt CJ at CL in his judgment on the trial of Maxwell Harold Trotter (unreported, 10 August 1993): 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The particular aspects of mind to which attention is usually paid in relation to this defence are the accused’s perception of events, his ability to form a rational (or sensible) judgment as to whether his actions were right or wrong, and his capacity to exercise willpower to control his physical actions in accordance with rational (or sensible) judgment. Such perception, ability and capacity vary widely in normal people. An abnormality of mind exists where there is a deviation from the range over which they may vary in normal people. A person’s mental responsibility for his actions concerns the extent to which his mind is answerable for his physical acts, and it too involves the extent of that person’s ability to exercise willpower to control his physical actions: Regina v Byrne (1960) 1 QB 396 at 403. That mental responsibility is impaired if it is diminished by reason of that abnormality of mind.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Notwithstanding the reference in that judgment and in Regina v Byrne to ‘the ability to form a rational judgment as to whether an act is right or wrong’ as a relevant factor in determining whether the defence of diminished responsibility is made out, the most frequent application of the principles of diminished responsibility has been in cases where an accused person relies upon a loss of the ability to exercise willpower to control physical acts. 
        
       
       
        
        Nevertheless, it is not so limited and all or any of the three aspects to which Hunt CJ at CL drew attention may be relevant in a particular case. 
        
       
       
        
        Dr Peter Gillies, Criminal Law 1985 at 214 said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The judgment in Byrne highlights the differences between the statutory defence of diminished responsibility, and the common law defence of insanity. … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The defence of insanity will not be grounded by an irresistible impulse per se, even as the irresistible impulse derives from a disease of mind (in terms of the insanity defence). As the court in Byrne explained, the insanity defence is narrowly defined ‘The test is a rigid one, it relates solely to a person’s intellectual ability to appreciate: (a) the physical act that he is doing; and (b) whether it is wrong. If he has such intellectual ability, his power to control his physical act by exercise of his will is irrelevant.’ The insanity defence, then, recognises only two distortions of the mental processes as being relevant. In contrast, the defence of diminished responsibility, in requiring no more than that the relevant abnormality of mind should ‘substantially impair … [the defendant’s] mental responsibility’ for the murder, may be grounded by reference to a much wider spectrum of disorders or disruptions of the mental processes. In particular, the defence is so defined as to confer its protection upon the defendant whose cognitive processes are more or less normal, but whose emotional state at the time of the killing is such that it may be said that the defendant’s mental responsibility for this killing was substantially impaired, provided that this emotional state derived from a relevant abnormality of mind.’ “ 
          
         
        
       
      
    41 In the present case, I am satisfied that the accused appreciated that his actions would kill the deceased. When questioned about the matter he admitted as much. His actions, in presenting his hands for securing when the police arrived at his home, and describing his actions as a sin, suggest that he may have understood, when committing the stabbing, that he knew that his actions were wrong. However, this evidence must be understood as part of the total sequence of events and, with the benefit of the opinion of the psychiatric evidence tendered by both the Crown and the accused. 
     
      
    42 It is apparent, from the extracts from the record of interview and other statements by the accused which I have included in these reasons, that it is not possible to reconstruct an entirely logical sequence of the events which occurred. In particular, I have not been able to construct from the statements by the accused, the thought processes which he had, at any particular time. 
     
      
    43 Dr Lewin, a forensic psychiatrist, was retained by the Crown. He reported, in relation to the accused, in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The history of a clearly entrenched mental illness was evidence in the hospital notes within days of Mr Phomaranuphong’s imprisonment. Given the long-term history of his illness since that time, it is my opinion that it is highly likely that he had a similar complex of mental symptoms in the weeks, and probably months, prior to the homicide. There is no firm evidence of psychosis in the materials which I read but a number of features are strongly suggestive of this. I refer to Mr Phomaranuphong’s decision to leave Queensland because of his feelings about how he was being treated. This suggested a persecutory flavour. I wondered about his apparent lack of success in tertiary studies but I noted that there were confounding variables which might give another explanation for his prolonged period of tertiary study. It is possible that this prolonged course of study at four different institutions was a reflection of mental disturbance. 
        
       
       
        
        I noted the material in the Records of Interview. I think it is difficult to interpret this particularly when it is considered that he was speaking in his second language. However, all these factors suggest that it is likely that he was mentally ill for a prolonged period before the event. Similarly, it is possible that the history of violence reported by the independent witnesses is a reflection of mental illness rather than merely a manifestation of bad behaviour. 
        
       
       
        
        It would be most unusual for a mental illness with this pattern of severity to arise suddenly. It is far more likely that there was a long prodromal phase of psychotic illness and a prolonged period of active psychosis before Mr Phomaranguphong’s imprisonment. When the current clinical course is considered, the most likely suggestion is that this illness was evident for, at least, a year and possibly longer before the homicide. I note that there is no clear evidence of this based upon direct observation or upon report of psychotic symptoms but rather an inference based upon the usual clinical course of such a condition. 
        
       
       
        
        On each of the three occasions when I examined Mr Phomaranuphong, he has manifested a marked degree of psychotic symptoms. His case is clearly towards the more extreme end of seriousness. The bizarre and enduring nature of his symptoms and the resistance of his case to a prolonged period of treatment in hospital with antipsychotic medication are noted. Mr Phomaranuphong described a range of persecutory delusions and far more bizarre delusions relating to special powers, passivity, the influence of occult forces upon his life and the effect of spirits. On the second and third occasion, Mr Phomaranuphong referred in detail to spiritual beings controlling his life. He also reported auditory hallucinations and visual hallucinations. 
        
       
       
        
        There are independent reports that Fon made a number of statements about killing herself, asking Mr Phomaranuphong to join her in this. When all the above is considered, I think it likely that Mr Phomaranuphong elaborated upon his own delusional experience in response to this dramatic statement by his partner … It appears that he incorporated Fon’s ideas about suicide in his own elaborate, delusional experience and then proceeded to act upon that basis. His subsequent statement about trying to do good by killing his girl friend and his belief that the woman’s mother had forgiven him within days is also consistent with this hypothesis. 
        
       
       
        
        I considered the legal tests with regard to insanity. It is my opinion that Mr Phomaranuphong was suffering from a Schizophrenic Illness at the time of the homicide and that he continues to suffer from that illness at the present time. The Schizophrenic Illness is a ‘disease of the mind.’ The delusional idea, that he was obliged to kill Fon for various altruistic reasons based upon delusional beliefs, appears to represent a ‘defect of reason.’ 
        
       
       
        
        It is my opinion that the ideas and the reasoning underlying them were delusional in quality. I have somewhat greater difficulty with the legal test of wrongfulness. It appears that the killing occurred against the background of a long-established mental illness where the illness was manifest by a range of very odd beliefs and where his pattern of thought (as evidenced by later examinations) appears to have been grossly disorganised. 
        
       
       
        
        It appears that Mr Phomaranuphong incorporated his partner’s ideas about killing herself rather than obeying her parents’ instructions to return to Thailand and asking him to do likewise. It was noted that in the context of the homicide, Mr Phomaranuphong had also inflicted multiple stab wounds upon himself and that he suffered significant although not life-threatening injuries.” 
        
       
      
    44 The doctor concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “it is my opinion that Mr Phomaranuphong acted upon the basis of an idea which he had picked up from his partner and then incorporated into his own highly disorganised delusional process of thinking. In the sense that he was responding to a delusion, it is my opinion that he did not know, at that time, that what he was doing was wrong.” 
        
       
      
    45 Dr Yolande Lucire also examined the accused, and the report was tendered before me. The report contains the following conclusions: 
     
      
       
        
        “Most religions that believe in an after-life would not see killing as a rational means of togetherness. This is just as psychotic for a Buddhist to kill in pursuit of togetherness in an after-life, as it would be if the same had been done by a Christian. 
        
       
       
        
        As religious beliefs do not possess the qualities of ‘truth’ or ‘falsehood’ such delusions are sometimes missed. A belief becomes a delusion when it is the organising principle of a person’s behaviour. For example many Christians believe ‘God loves me’. However, when a Christian starts becoming focussed on such an idea, neglecting the real world and organising his or her life in accordance with that belief, then a psychiatric could legitimately suspect that the belief ‘God loves me’ has the characteristics of a delusion. It would respond to medication.  
        
       
       
        
        Here, the notion that one kills to achieve perpetual union is a delusion as is his current belief that he has achieved that union. The union is achieved by hallucinations and delusions. 
        
       
       
        
        At Question 237, there is further evidence of disturbance the night before, Fon is alleged to have tried to strangle him in response to his request that she kill him. 
        
       
       
        
        On the basis of the written information available, Mr Phomaranuphong had a prior personality disturbance which was possibly the prodrome of this illness. This could account for his temperament, his occasional violence, his failing in his studies, his vulnerability to perceived abandonment. 
        
       
       
        
        The evidence is also that, at the time that the stress of impending abandonment and Fon’s behaviour, he developed a delusion to the effect that the solution to his problems was to kill her and to kill himself to achieve perpetual union. 
        
       
       
        
        A delusion which crystallises from a complex situation is called an ‘autochthonous’ delusion. Autochthonous means ‘springing from the ground’. [Dr Lewin and I discussed the possibility that this was an autochthonous delusion]. 
        
       
       
        
        There followed an episode of frenzied behaviour, consistent with acute psychotic disturbance. During the next few minutes Mr Phomaranuphong inflicted 14 stab wounds on Fon and several on himself. 
        
       
       
        
        He also realised he was ‘sinful’ to kill her; he immediately telephoned police and made a full confession. 
        
       
       
        
        I believe that Mr Phomaranuphong killed in a psychotic state, driven by a delusional belief that he should kill her in order to achieve a spiritual union with Fon. 
        
       
       
        
        I believe that the homicide was motivated by this delusion. 
        
       
       
        
        I believe that this delusion is still in evidence and, if Mr Phomaranuphong has a remission, he will be able to again say why he did it. He will be able to reflect on how insane he must have been to have thought so then, and for such a long period after.” 
        
       
      
    46 Finally, the doctor expressed an opinion: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Phomaranuphong remains unfit to plead. He seems to have made the simple choice to have a judge alone. 
        
       
       
        
        He was at the relevant time, mentally ill. 
        
       
       
        
        His action of killing was motivated or propelled by a delusion, one he has maintained. 
        
       
       
        
        He knew afterwards that it was sinful. He killed in the delusional believe that Fon wanted to be killed so they could be together. He did not appreciate the nature and quality of the act and he still does not. The act was a product of mental illness.” 
        
       
      
    47 I have already indicated that I have been troubled by the statement by the accused that, at the time of the killing: 
     
      
       
        
        “I felt that I was sinful at the time, I committed a sin.” 
        
       
      
    48 This statement suggests that the accused, when killing the deceased, knew that his actions were wrong. However, I accept the evidence of Dr Lucire that at the time of the killing the accused was deluded.  
     
      
    49 The accused’s statement that he “believed he had no choice” but to kill the deceased, is, as I have indicated, in the opinion of Dr Lucire, evidence of such a delusion and not of a rational belief or a rational act.  
     
      
    50 I accept further, that, although he knew afterwards that his actions were sinful, because of his delusion he did not know of “the nature and quality of the act at the time it was committed.” 
     
      
    51 Dr Lewin’s evidence, which I also accept, is to similar effect. 
     
      
    52 I am satisfied that at the time of this tragic killing the accused was suffering from a disease of the mind. He had suffered in this way for some time and, faced with the prospect of the termination of his relationship with the deceased, acted upon the suggestion of the deceased about dying. 
     
      
    53 I am satisfied that, at the time of the stabbing, the accused was not able to reason rationally about the rightness of his act. 
     
      
    54 For these reasons I am satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the defence of mental illness is made out. 
     
      
    55 Accordingly, the verdict is that the accused is not guilty on the grounds of mental illness. 
     
      
    56 In accordance with s 39 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 I am required to make an order providing for the accused’s further detention. I order that Cherdchai Phomaranuphong be detained at the Long Bay prison hospital, or at such other place as may from time to time be determined by the Minister for Health, until he is released by due process of law.

      REGINA v WRW 
       
       
      Judgment 
       
     1 HEYDON JA: The appellant appeals against his conviction by a jury after a trial presided over by Tupman DCJ of one count of rape (the fourth on the indictment) and one of indecent assault (the fifth on the indictment).  
      
       
     2 The indictment charged him with four counts of rape and one of indecent assault; in relation to each of the rape counts he was charged in the alternative with unlawful carnal knowledge. The alleged victim was his stepdaughter.  
      
       
     3 The indictment took the following form: 
      
       
        
         
         “On 8th of November 2000, the Director of Public Prosecutions on behalf of Her Majesty charges that 
         
        
        
         
         [the appellant] 
         
        
        
         
         1. between the 15 July 1972 and 15 October 1972 at Nulkaba in the State of New South Wales, did without her consent, ravish and carnally know [the complainant]. 
         
        
        
         
         AND THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS FURTHER CHARGES IN THE ALTERNATIVE THAT 
         
        
        
         
         [the appellant] 
         
        
        
         
         1. between the 15 July 1972 and 15 October 1972 at Nulkaba in the State of New South Wales, being the stepfather of [the complainant], did unlawfully and carnally know [the complainant] she being a girl above the age of 10 years and under 17 years, namely 10 or 11 years of age. 
         
        
        
         
         AND THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS FURTHER CHARGES THAT

         5. between 15 February 1973 and 15 March 1973, at Nulkaba in the State of New South Wales, did assault … [the complainant] and that [the appellant] at the time of such assault did commit an act of indecency upon … [the complainant] and she … [the complainant] being then under the age of sixteen years, namely eleven years.” 
         
        
       
     4 The jury failed to reach a verdict on count 1, found a verdict of not guilty on counts 2 and 3, and convicted the appellant on the fourth count of rape and the count of indecent assault.  
      
       
     5 The appellant was given leave to amend the Notice of Appeal at the hearing of the appeal on 3 August 2001. Ground 4 (relating to conviction) and Ground 6 (relating to sentence) were abandoned, and a new Ground 6 introduced. The amended Notice of Appeal was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “1. The trial judge erred in allowing the Crown Prosecutor to re-examine the complainant as to why she failed to complain to her mother … and aunty … .. 
         
        
        
         
         2. The trial judge erred in failing to exclude the evidence of the complainant in re-examination as to her belief that the appellant and [her aunt] were having ‘an affair’. 
         
        
        
         
         3. The trial miscarried as a result of the Crown Prosecutor misleading the appellant (in cross-examination) as to the date of birth of the child of [the aunt] as ‘about September 1973’. 
         
        
        
         
         4. … 
         
        
        
         
         5. The verdicts of guilty are unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         6. The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury that if they entertained a reasonable doubt concerning the truthfulness or reliability of the complainant’s evidence in relation to one or more counts, that must be taken into account in assessing the truthfulness or reliability of the complainant’s evidence generally.” 
         
        
       
     6 At the hearing of the appeal the appellant also sought, and was granted, leave to file and serve further written submissions within seven days in relation to various matters, including the decision in R v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290, which had only been decided on 1 August 2001. In fact the written submissions were not filed and served within seven days because of some breakdown of communications between counsel for the appellant and his instructing solicitor. They were not filed and served until 12 November, and the Crown responded to them on 13 November.  
      
       
        
       Background 
       
     7 A useful summary of the factual controversy appears in the appellant’s written submissions as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “Count 1 
         
        
        
         
         The complainant alleged that the appellant (her step-father) while in the TV room of their house had penile/vaginal intercourse with her whilst she was seated on his lap (TT -77.55). The complainant alleged that the appellant was naked at the time and that he undressed her prior to intercourse taking place. The appellant directed her to sit on his lap. The appellant ejaculated into a handkerchief. The complainant went to the toilet noticing that her periods had just started. She told the appellant of this fact and he told her to put a pad on. On the issue of dating this incident she further said that she became aware that her mother was pregnant with [the complainant’s half sister] (born 21/2/73) ‘a few days or a week’ after this incident (TT – 81.35). 
         
        
        
         
         Count 2 
         
        
        
         
         The complainant alleged that she and the appellant were in the lounge room of their home when the appellant raised the topic of the pigs on the farm mating. The appellant told the complainant to undress and directed her onto the floor on her hands and knees where he penetrated her vagina from behind with his penis (TT – 78.48). Her evidence as to the timing of this incident was ‘probably been a few days before the birthday’ – ie her 12th birthday – ie the 28th September 1973 (TT – 82.13).  
         
        
        
         
         Count 3 
         
        
        
         
         The complainant alleged that on her 12th birthday (28/9/73) she spoke to her mother by phone who told her where her birthday present was. She located the present which was a brunch coat and nightie. The appellant asked the complainant to try the nightie and brunch coat on. The appellant then undressed the complainant and had penile vaginal intercourse with her on a fold out lounge in the lounge room of their house The appellant asked the complainant to sleep with him that night but she refused (TT – 79.18).  
         
        
        
         
         Count 4 
         
        
        
         
         The complainant alleged that at a time when her aunty … was staying at their house the complainant had penile-vaginal intercourse with her in the lounge room near the front door. During this incident the complainant’s mother and aunty returned to the farm by car. At that stage the appellant told the complainant to go and fix herself up (TT – 80.8). The complainant’s aunty gave evidence to the effect that she recalled staying at the appellant’s house for a period of two weeks around the time of her birthday on the 27th February 1974 as she suffered an injury to her eye whilst picking grapes in the area (TT 150.36). 
         
        
        
         
         Count 5 
         
        
        
         
         The complainant alleged that whilst her mother was in hospital giving birth to [the complainant’s half sister] (21/2/73) she approached the appellant who was in bed to sign a ‘permission note’ and whilst there the appellant placed his fingers in her vagina (TT 80.33). At this time the complainant’s grandmother and [her] de facto husband were assisting in looking after the complainant and the other children whilst her mother was in hospital. 
         
        
        
         
         It should be noted that the complainant gave evidence of uncharged acts of sexual assault – two having occurred prior to the first count in the indictment and the third after the last count in the indictment. 
         
        
        
         
         Defence Case 
         
        
        
         
         The appellant gave evidence denying that he ever sexually assaulted the complainant. The appellant’s wife gave evidence in relation to a number of matters directly opposed to the evidence of the complainant.” 
         
        
        
       Ground 1: re-examination of complainant 
       
     8 When the trial opened on 8 November 2000, the trial judge said that counsel had been discussing some issues with her in chambers. One related to complaint evidence. The trial judge said that the complainant said in her statement that she had complained to her aunt some time after the events in issue, and complained to her mother about ten years later. The trial judge asked the Crown prosecutor if he intended to call that complaint evidence. He said he would if it were to be suggested to the complainant in cross-examination that she had never complained, or that when she did complain she lied, but not otherwise. The trial judge said that if it were to be called, it should be called in chief.  
      
       
     9 On 9 November 2000, shortly before the complainant began to testify, the Crown prosecutor said that evidence of complaint would not be called if the only cross-examination of the complainant related to her failure to make immediate complaint. But if it were to be suggested that she had never made any complaint, immediately or otherwise, the Crown would call evidence of it. 
      
       
     10 In relation to each of the first three incidents the complainant was asked in cross-examination about whether she complained immediately to her mother, in relation to the fourth incident she was asked if she complained immediately to her aunt, and in relation to the fifth incident she was asked whether she complained immediately to her grandmother or her grandmother’s de facto spouse. In each case she said she did not.  
      
       
     11 At the end of the complainant’s cross-examination, the transcript records the following: 
      
       
        
         
         “(Crown Prosecutor advised her Honour that he intends raising with witness in re-examination why she did not complain to her mother, as Mr Johnston has asked questions relating to did she complain to her mother. Her Honour advised that this is a credit issue and Crown Prosecutor is entitled to re-examine on this issue. Mr Johnston has no objection to this course.)  
         
        
        
         
         SHORT ADJOURNMENT 
         
        
        
         
         (Crown Prosecutor advised her Honour that intends raising the with witness in re-examination why she did not tell her aunt in relation to the driveway incident, charge 4. Her Honour advised that the Crown Prosecutor that he is entitled to re-examine the witness in this regard.)” 
         
        
       
     12 This event was not a departure from what the Crown prosecutor had earlier foreshadowed. What was discussed earlier was whether the Crown prosecutor would call evidence of non-immediate complaint. What the Crown prosecutor now foreshadowed was evidence about why there had not been immediate complaint. This is no doubt why Mr Johnston, counsel for the appellant, said he had no objection.  
      
       
     13 After some preliminary questions in re-examination from the Crown prosecutor, the transcript records: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. In relation to that incident was there a reason why you didn’t tell your mother at that time about it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I didn’t have a good relationship with my mother, in fact we were all fairly fearful of my mother, she was the disciplinarian in the family, and we were raised to speak when spoken to. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you speak to the accused about telling anybody? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes, I had threatened to tell, and he had said that no-one would believe me. 
         
        
        
         
         OBJECTION 
         
        
        
         
         HER HONOUR: What time period are you talking about? 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. I’m sorry, in relation to this first incident that you talked about, that happened at the time your mother was pregnant with [the complainant’s half sister]? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you speak to the accused -- 
         
        
        
         
         OBJECTION. NOT ARISING FROM CROSS-EXAMINATION 
         
        
        
         
         IN THE ABSENCE OF THE JURY 
         
        
        
         
         WITNESS STOOD DOWN 
         
        
        
         
         WITNESS LEAVES THE COURT 
         
        
        
         
         (Crown Prosecutor submits that question goes to the reason why witness had not told her mother, and that that arises from cross-examination. Discussion ensued. Crown Prosecutor advised that certain information has been given in conference by witness which is not contained in her statements. Mr Johnston advised her Honour that this material, part of the Crown case, has never been served on defence and he had had prior knowledge of threats being made, he would not have asked questions relating to why witness did not complain at the time of incident. Mr Johnston foreshadows that if this line of questioning is allowed he may make an application to discharge jury. Discussion ensued. Her Honour proposes to counsel that evidence be called on voir dire.)” 
         
        
       
     14 Apparently, in some way which is not clear, an impression had arisen that the complainant might give evidence of having been threatened by the appellant.  
      
       
     15 A voir dire then took place. In the course of it the complainant said that she had been sexually assaulted by the de facto spouse of her grandmother. She also said that the appellant had had an affair with her aunt (i.e. his sister-in-law). Counsel for the appellant applied for a discharge of the jury, unsuccessfully. The Crown prosecutor then said he would not ask the complainant why she had not complained either to her grandmother or her “grandfather” (presumably meaning the grandmother’s de facto spouse).  
      
       
     16 At this point the transcript records: 
      
       
        
         
         “HER HONOUR: Mr Johnston it seems to me that the voir dire evidence has indicated that the complainant will not give evidence of having been threatened by the accused. She will give evidence at most of the accused having said to her on some occasions, the only one of which she can recall specifically being an occasion in about 1974, after these events, that he said ‘Don’t tell anyone, they won’t believe you.’ 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (Mr Johnston submits that the nature of the evidence arising from voir dire is such that the only date that the complainant can fix is a date that post dates the charges that are before the Court, and that the Court could not be satisfied that the acts occurred at or around the time of other incidents, and it would be improper to put such information to the jury. Mr Johnston also submits that the defence should be entitled to cross-examine complainant on the point that information was not included in her statements and that the only date she can recall is a date post-dating incidents complained of. Crown Prosecutor does not object to this course. Discussion ensued. Her Honour advised that she will inform complainant that she is not allowed to say anything about complaints made in relation to [the grandmother’s de facto spouse].) 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (Mr Johnston submits that evidence concerning complainant’s aunt would be unfairly prejudicial to defence case and that probative value in relation to that is not high, and refers to s 136, to limit the nature of evidence.) 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         HER HONOUR: No I will not do that Mr Johnston, it is not true. I will not do that. That is not what 136 is as about, in my view, in any event, 136 is not a mandate for altering the words of the evidence, it is simply a mandate for altering the extent to which the evidence can be used, to limit its use. 136 does not allow me to tell a witness that she cannot give the evidence in her own words but must give it in a way which is not consistent with what I know she is going to say. Just let me get this right – the jury would be unfairly prejudiced against the accused if they find out that it was common knowledge that he had an affair with his sister-in-law? 
         
        
        
         
         JOHNSTON: Yes your Honour. 
         
        
        
         
         HER HONOUR: In 1973? 
         
        
        
         
         JOHNSTON: Yes your Honour. 
         
        
        
         
         HER HONOUR: No, I am against you Mr Johnston. Now if that is the evidence that she gives, and that would seem to be because that is one of the reasons she gave on the voir dire, again I cannot help but observe that this sort of material should have been in the police statement in the first place, it finds its way into most other police statements for offences of this nature, but it wasn’t. But in any event Mr Johnston, you’re not saying that you wouldn’t cross-examine her about not telling the mother if you knew that was the reason are you? 
         
        
        
         
         JOHNSTON: Your Honour it’s the case that as the trial’s progressed I have deliberately refrained from asking those questions, and I did not pursue that line of questioning when I was cross-examining her about the incident with the aunty at all. I didn’t put to her that the reason it couldn’t have occurred in 1974 was because of the fact that there had been this affair with the aunty. 
         
        
        
         
         HER HONOUR: But you have got ambivalent evidence from her about that anyway. I mean I must say it occurred to me at the time I wasn’t sure why you didn’t, because she says clearly in her evidence in chief it happened in February 1974, she says that she knows that it’s February because her aunty told her, but apart from that she knows herself that it’s either December 73, January, February 74. But she also said something like ‘I’m not sure’, exactly what she meant by that I do not know. But that is the totality of her evidence. I mean the totality of her evidence is not just ‘I’m not sure’, she’s given much more evidence about it than that. You’ve made that decision not to raise it. 
         
        
        
         
         JOHNSTON: And that’s why I’m suggesting the fact that it wasn’t raised your Honour, to raise it now would unfairly prejudice the accused. 
         
        
        
         
         HER HONOUR: Well no, I am against you Mr Johnston. I propose to allow the evidence to be called along the lines of the voir dire about any other reasons that there were for not telling her mother as to 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, and her aunty as to 4 as well, but not for there to be any questions about why she didn’t tell her grandfather [i.e. her grandmother’s de facto spouse], and for that matter her grandmother. There are no issues raised about the possibility of threats. If that had been the case my view might well have been different, but it doesn’t seem to me that the fact that it might come out that there was an affair between your client and his sister-in-law is such that it would be unfairly prejudicial to the accused, any inferences the jury might draw against him in relation to that.” 
         
        
       
     17 The re-examination then resumed. The complainant said the reason why she did not make immediate complaint to her mother was that her relationship with her was not good, that the appellant told her that no-one would believe her and that he would deny it, and that she was “in general frightened”. In particular, she was frightened of her mother. She said she did not complain to her aunt after the fourth incident because she believed the aunt was having sexual relations with the appellant. She said she did not complain to her mother about the fifth incident because her mother was in hospital. She said that the appellant said “No-one will believe you, I’ll deny it” a few times; she could not specifically relate these conversations to any of the charged incidents, but could relate it to another incident.  
      
       
     18 In further cross-examination the complainant said she related the words to the last uncharged incident, which took place in the shower, at a time after the five charged incidents. She admitted she had not recorded the words of the conversations in her statement to the police dated 11 January 1999. The Crown prosecutor admitted that she had not recorded those words in another statement to the police either.  
      
       
     19 The appellant put the following submission to this Court: 
      
       
        
         
         “Counsel for the appellant [below submitted] that as the complainant could not fix this comment by the appellant (in time) in relation to any specific count in the indictment the evidence should be excluded because it is only relevant as far as recent complaint is concerned and the evidence falls far short of establishing its recency in relation to any of the counts charged in the indictment. The trial judge referred to this comment by the appellant to the complainant in her directions to the jury (SU 36.7). The actual evidence she gave on this matter in the trial proper is found at page 124.15 which is even more remote as far as ‘recency’ to any of the five counts in the indictment. 
         
        
        
         
         This evidence was clearly inadmissible and prejudicial to the appellant’s case – particularly having regard to the fact that it came in re-examination. The Crown knew prior to the complainant giving evidence that on the issue of complaint the appellant was only going to the jury on the question of no recent complaint not that she had made no complaint at all.” 
         
        
       
     20 The evidence elicited by the cross-examiner of the complainant’s failure to complain immediately was relevant and admissible evidence going to the credit of the complainant. The “credibility rule” created by s 102 of the Evidence Act 1995 that evidence that is relevant only to a witness’s credibility is not admissible does not apply to evidence adduced in re-examination: s 108(1). The evidence in which the complainant gave explanations for her failure to complain immediately was evidence which the jury could treat as being capable of restoring her credibility, or at least qualifying any damaging impact on her credibility caused by her failure to complain. The explanation that the appellant told her not to tell anyone because they would not believe her was relevant in the same way as the evidence of the other explanations provided that it “could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of the fact in issue”: s 55(1). That depended on whether it was open to the jury to infer that the statements were made by the appellant soon after any of the five charged events. In the first passage of re-examination, the complainant said that the appellant told her that no-one would believe her about the first incident “at the time [her] mother was pregnant with [the complainant’s half sister]”. On the voir dire she said that that type of conversation took place a few times, though she could not link them in point of time with any incident other than the uncharged shower incident, which took place later than the five charged incidents. She also said that similar words had been said “before” that shower incident.  
      
       
     21 The admissibility of this material in the second stage of re-examination has two aspects. In the light of what the complainant said before and during the voir dire, should further questioning about what the appellant said have been allowed? Once it had been allowed, should the evidence have been struck out?  
      
       
     22 There was no error in the trial judge allowing the questions, because after the voir dire, assuming the complainant’s evidence before the jury were to correspond with that given on the voir dire, it was correct for the trial judge to assume that the evidence was capable of explaining her failure to complain. She said that she could remember the conversation after the shower incident; that she could remember other conversations; and that those other conversations occurred before it. The complainant in November 2000, as an adult, was trying to remember events in the early 1970’s over an eight month period. Statements made before the shower incident were capable of explaining a failure to complain about the earlier five charged incidents occurring over those eight months. It was for the jury to decide whether the complainant was to be accepted in testifying that the appellant had said what she alleged, and, if so, whether this had a causative influence on her failure to complain about the fifth or any earlier incident. The foreshadowed evidence was necessarily non-specific, but it was capable of amounting to an explanation. 
      
       
     23 The second issue is whether, when the actual evidence was given, it should have been struck out on the ground that it fell below that foreshadowed on the voir dire. It was given a little more vaguely before the jury than it had been on the voir dire. Before the jury the complainant did not in terms say that conversations of the relevant type had occurred “before” the shower incident. But in substance she said that, because she said that she remembered the conversations in relation to the shower incident, the shower incident was the only non-charged incident after the five charged incidents, it would be unlikely that the conversation would have occurred more than once after the shower incident, and hence some of the conversations occurred before the shower incident. The evidence was not so irrelevant or prejudicial as to merit it being removed from the jury’s consideration, and indeed defence counsel did not apply for this to be done.  
      
       
     24 Ground 1 fails. 
      
       
        
       Ground 2: the affair between the appellant and his sister-in-law 
       
     25 The appellant submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “Objection to this evidence was taken by the appellant’s counsel (TT 119.58) pursuant to section 136 of the Evidence Act 1995 (119.58). The objection should have been taken pursuant to section 135(a) of that Act. The relevance of this evidence from the Crown’s point of view was that it was one of a number of explanations given by the complainant as to why she did not complain at the time of the sexual assaults to her mother or aunty. The evidence was highly prejudicial from the appellant’s point of view – having an affair with his wife’s sister in this general period when he was allegedly sexually assaulting his stepdaughter. The jury had before it sufficient reason as to why the complainant did not complain immediately – ie her poor relationship with her mother and the appellant telling her no one would believe her. Once the issue of the affair was put before the jury it took on a life of its own taking on undue significance in the context of the trial.” 
         
        
       
     26 There is no doubt that if the complainant’s evidence of suspecting the affair was accepted, it would be a powerful reason why the complainant would not have complained to her aunt. To have complained would no doubt have led to a series of most unpleasant scenes which a twelve or thirteen year old girl would be anxious to avoid.  
      
       
     27 The prejudicial effect of the evidence was slight. For a man to have an affair with his wife’s sister is not to be regarded as admirable conduct, but it does not of itself suggest that he was the type of man who would have sexual relations with a young girl who was his stepdaughter.  
      
       
     28 Though the trial judge was not in terms asked to exercise her discretion under s 135, she appeared to take that into consideration of her own motion. She did not err in the conclusion to which she came.  
      
       
     29 Ground 2 fails. 
      
       
        
       Ground 3: misleading the appellant as to the date of birth of the appellant’s sister-in-law’s child 
        
       
     30 Ground 3 relates to count 4. The Crown case on count 4 was that the offence was committed between 1 February and 14 March 1974.  
      
       
     31 On the second last day of the evidence, 13 November 2000, the Crown prosecutor suggested to the appellant in cross-examination that his sister-in-law had a child in about September 1973. Initially the appellant said he did not know when she had the child. Then the following evidence was given: 
      
       
        
         
         Q. I suggest to you that she was born in about September 1973, about the same time as [the complainant] turned 12? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well if – yeah she must’ve done. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You’ve told the Court that [the complainant’s half sister], well not just you telling the Court, I think it’s established evidence, that [the complainant’s half sister] was born in February 1973? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. If you accept that [the complainant’s half sister] was born in September 1973 and that you say the visit to your house occurred when [the complainant’s half sister] was a few months old, that would put it about what May/June 1973?  
         
        
        
         
         A. About then, yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. That is some three to four months before [the sister-in-law] had her child? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yeah that’d be right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I’d suggest to you that your affair with her was in February 1974, not June/July or May/June 1973? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You say you had an affair with her when she was six or seven months pregnant do you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What you distinctly remember your sister-in-law being quite pregnant at the time you had the affair with her, do you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When did it occur to you that your sister-in-law was quite pregnant at the time you had the affair with her? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I don’t follow what you mean. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Your evidence is that your sister-in-law was pregnant at the time you had the affair with her? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When did it occur to you that that was her condition at the time you had the affair? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well I knew she was pregnant.” 
         
        
       
     32 The next witness, the appellant’s wife, gave evidence that in fact the child in question was not born in about September 1973, but November 1972.  
      
       
     33 At the start of 14 November 2000, the day after the evidence of the appellant and the appellant’s wife was given, which was also the day on which the parties addressed and the trial judge summed up, the Crown prosecutor informed the trial judge in the absence of the jury of the mistaken factual assumption on which he had cross-examined the appellant. Various possible courses could have been adopted to deal with the Crown prosecutor’s error. One was to discharge the jury and recommence the trial. The appellant did not request this and it would have been an extreme outcome. Another was to say nothing about the error. However, the appellant did not oppose the error being identified and corrected. The trial judge decided that the matter required correction in the presence of the jury. She said this was important for various reasons.  
      
       
        
         
         “I think it has to be raised because, first of all it’s important as far as the complainant’s evidence is concerned because there are two counts on the indictment that she claims happened either on or around her 12th birthday and she claims that she remembers her mother wasn’t there and she thinks her mother wasn’t there because she was in Sydney helping her sister who was giving birth to a child. If her recollection that her mother wasn’t there is capable of being tested possibly by the reason why she thinks she wasn’t there and she’s obviously got that wrong. So that’s important for that reason. It’s also important in terms of assessing the accused’s evidence so far as the jury is concerned. If what he was doing was simply accepting what you were putting to him as a positive proposition and that is that his niece by marriage was born in around about September October 73, which was what you thought was the case at the time, then what he’s obviously done is to think, oh, she must’ve been pregnant, I suppose I’d better agree with that. If that’s the way the jury sees it that’s significant in terms of assessing him as a credible witness.” 
         
        
       
     34 The following debate then took place between counsel for the appellant and the trial judge: 
      
       
        
         
         “JOHNSTON: Your Honour, the difficulty I have with that -- 
         
        
        
         
         HER HONOUR: Even if I don’t tell them, the Crown can say so in his address to the jury. 
         
        
        
         
         JOHNSTON: But if the Crown capitalises on that, your Honour, the Crown’s capitalising on a false proposition that was put to [the appellant] yesterday. 
         
        
        
         
         HER HONOUR: But your client didn’t have to agree that his lover was six months pregnant if it weren’t true – he did. It clearly wasn’t true, or if it was true it wasn’t around about the time that [the ccomplainant’s half sister] was born. He’s agreed with it. One might’ve thought it something that he might’ve noticed. 
         
        
        
         
         JOHNSTON: Except in relation to the pregnancy, your Honour. 
         
        
        
         
         HER HONOUR: Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         JOHNSTON: That point that in relation to the dates themselves [the appellant’s] evidence was not that he agreed with the dates, [the appellant’s] evidence was that if the Crown was telling him that that’s the dates, he accepts those dates. 
         
        
        
         
         HER HONOUR: Yes, but then having agreed with that – that’s not so, Mr Johnston, because he went on then and said in response to the proposition which had not been raised before that therefore that must’ve meant that the person with whom he was having an affair was about five or six months pregnant, he said, ‘Oh yes, she was.’ 
         
        
        
         
         JOHNSTON: I accept the second part of what your Honour’s saying but the first part still is that -- 
         
        
        
         
         HER HONOUR: Yes, he was led into it and presumably what you’re saying is that he didn’t really know what dates and he was accepting that what he was being told was correct. Now, it turns out it’s not correct.  
         
        
        
         
         JOHNSTON: And in effect he was misled in relation to those dates. It’d be my submission that it would be unfair to capitalise on the fact that the propositions that proceeded it misled him.” 
         
        
       
     35 Shortly after the jury returned the Crown prosecutor made the correction and the trial judge repeated it. 
      
       
     36 The appellant submitted to this Court: 
      
       
        
         
         “Counsel for the appellant objected to the Crown attacking the appellant’s credit on the basis that the accused agreed that [his sister-in-law] was six or seven months pregnant when he had an affair with her when this was obviously wrong – the Crown having misled the accused as to the date of birth of her child. The trial judge refused to restrict the use the Crown could make of this evidence on addressing the jury (TT 198-40). 
         
        
        
         
         This evidence plus the admission of the evidence that the appellant was having an affair with his sister in law would have caused irreparable damage to the credit of the appellant in the eyes of the jury.” 
         
        
       
     37 The mere fact that the appellant was having an affair with his sister-in-law, which was a proposition advanced by the appellant in his evidence in chief and not a proposition thrust on him by the cross-examiner, would not have caused irreparable damage to his credit. The sister-in-law, for one, denied it. In any event the proposition was not one which had an inherent tendency to damage the appellant as a witness of truth. The error, so far as it was adopted by the appellant, and it was not clear whether he did adopt it as anything more than an assumption he was asked to work with, was speedily corrected – first by the testimony of the appellant’s wife, then by the Crown prosecutor and then by the trial judge.  
      
       
     38 A new point was advanced in the oral submissions put to this Court on behalf of the appellant. Those submissions contended that in the Crown’s address to the jury it “did rely on the point that the appellant in fact lied in relation to him having a relationship with [his sister-in-law] at a time when she was notably pregnant”. What the Crown address said, in the course of an attack on the credibility of the appellant and his wife, was: 
      
       
        
         
         “You remember yesterday I put to him about the time frame at which [his sister-in-law’s] daughter was born. Now the date put was wrong. But on the evidence, I withdraw that. On the proposition I was advancing she would have been very pregnant at that time, noticeably pregnant at the time. Now you might think to yourself that if you were having an affair with somebody who was pregnant that would probably stick in your mind. And when it was put to him, ‘Oh yeah, yeah, that’s right, she was pregnant’. Not ‘I don’t think that was the case’ or ‘I didn’t know’ or ‘I don’t remember’ but ‘Oh no, she must have been pregnant. She was pregnant.’ What I’d suggest to you, that indicates fairly strongly that he’s making it up as he went along.” 
         
        
       
     39 The Crown put the following submission to this Court: 
      
       
        
         
         “What happened on one construction was that the accused advanced before the jury a case whereby he had an independent recollection that this woman was pregnant at the time of the affair. It’s an arguable point as to whether, on the one hand, he was misled. It’s a matter where even on the Crown’s closing, it’s not a case where what the accused actually said, necessarily resulted from him having been misled about the date when certain things occurred.” 
         
        
       
     40 The issue of whether the appellant’s evidence about his perception of his sister-in-law’s pregnancy was dishonest was not dependent on the mistake about the birth date of her child. The revelation of any dishonesty on that topic was occasioned by that mistake, but not contributed to by it. The Crown prosecutor’s point was a fair one. The proposition that the appellant was having an affair with his sister-in-law whilst she was pregnant rested on the proposition that the child was born in September 1973, not November 1972. The proposition that his sister-in-law was pregnant in the course of the affair was accepted by the appellant on three occasions. He could have said he did not remember. He could have denied that she was pregnant. Instead he said she was pregnant. His acceptance of the proposition, which, once the Crown prosecutor’s error was corrected, can be seen to have been incorrect, was capable of casting great doubt on his veracity. The Crown prosecutor capitalised on the evidence which the appellant gave, but it was not unfair to do so. The line of reasoning which the Crown advanced to the jury is one which the jurors were capable of adopting for themselves, and so the reasoning would not have been illegitimate or invalid. If there was any method by which that line of reasoning could be weakened, it was open to counsel for the appellant to deploy it in his address, which followed the Crown prosecutor’s address.  
      
       
     41 Ground 3 is rejected. 
      
       
        
       Ground 5: unreasonable verdicts 
       
     42 The appellant submitted that the failure of the jury to agree on count 1 and their verdicts of not guilty on counts 2 and 3 suggested that they felt unable to accept the complainant’s evidence as “truthful and reliable” on those counts, and that in consequence her credibility generally was “greatly diminished”. The appellant submitted that nothing in her evidence or the surrounding circumstances “offered any comfort that [the convictions on counts 4 and 5] were reasonable”. The appellant relied on R v Carbone (2000) NSWCCA 387 at [56]-[57] per Wood CJ at CL.  
      
       
     43 In R v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290 Spigelman CJ said that the reasoning in cases like R v Carbone suggests that Jones v R (1997) 191 CLR 439 established the proposition that in a pure word against word case a mixture of acquittals and convictions cannot be sustained unless the Court can detect a relevant difference in the quality of the complainant’s evidence. He continued (at [65]-[66] and [69]-[74]): 
      
       
        
         
         “In my opinion that is not what the High Court intended. Whether or not the failure of the jury to accept the complainant’s version in one respect ought to have led to [sic] the jury to have a reasonable doubt with respect to other matters, must depend on the full range of relevant circumstances. The High Court held in Jones that on the facts of that case the acquittal necessarily undermined the credibility of the complainant’s evidence about other alleged incidents. By reason of the wide range of matters of fact and degree that must be considered in making a credibility finding, that conclusion does not, in my opinion, follow in every such case unless the Court is positively satisfied that there is some relevant difference in the quality of the complainant’s evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         I repeat, with my emphasis, a sentence from the joint judgment in Jones at 453: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘There is nothing in the complainant’s evidence 
            or the surrounding circumstances 
            which gives any ground for supposing that her evidence was more reliable in relation to those counts than it was in relation to the second count.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         The reference to ‘the surrounding circumstances’ requires an appellate court to consider all the facts of the case. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         The absence of any relevant difference in the complainant’s evidence was emphasised in Jones … . It is not, however, in my opinion, the case that the reasoning in Jones requires a court of criminal appeal to quash a conviction in a pure word against word case, unless the differences between or amongst the verdicts can be explained in this way. 
         
        
        
         
         Indeed, the court’s respect for the constitutional role of the jury, affirmed in Jones itself, is such that a court of criminal appeal could conclude that subtle differences in the way evidence was presented – differences not apparent from the transcript available on appeal – may explain what appear to be, at first sight, inconsistent verdicts.  
         
        
        
         
         In R v J (1994) 75 A Crim R 522 at 540, Brooking J referred to ‘the inability of the transcript to record pauses or other indications of indecision’. In R v Robinson (2000) 111 A Crim R 388 at [61] Barr J referred to the possibility that the jury may make an assessment of reliability ‘… by the way he gave his evidence rather than by what he said’. Adams J made similar observations in ARD [[2000] NSWCCA 443] at [201] [203]. See also Spiteri v The Queen [2001] WASCA 82 at [34]. 
         
        
        
         
         Furthermore, in a number of cases a court of criminal appeal has expressed its conclusion in terms of what a jury ‘may’ have done, which suggests that some form of differentiation about the character of the complainant’s evidence was accepted by the jury, although it was not apparent to the appellate court. … 
         
        
        
         
         The circumstances of a particular case may lead to the conclusion that a jury which has found that it had a reasonable doubt with respect to a complainant’s evidence on one count, ought to have had such a doubt with respect to other counts. However, it does not follow that that must necessarily be the case. 
         
        
        
         
         It is not, however, easy to formulate principles as to when a jury should conclude that a reasonable doubt on one count, notwithstanding the complainant’s evidence on that matter, means that the jury ought to have a reasonable doubt about other counts, about which the only evidence is from the complainant.” 
         
        
       
       
       Grove J and Carruthers AJ agreed. Wood CJ at CL said that his analysis in  
       R v Carbone 
        required qualification in view of Spigelman CJ’s analysis. 
        
       
     44 The trial judge directed the jury that the time periods or dates referred to in the indictment were essential elements, and if the jury experienced reasonable doubt about any one of them, they had to acquit in relation to it. That direction was repeated for each specific count as the trial judge came to each of them.  
      
       
     45 The appellant submitted that the differences in the jury’s approach to the five counts could not be explained by failure to be satisfied as to the timing of the first three incidents but not the fourth and fifth. The appellant submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “In relation to count 1 the time frame was the 15th July 1972 to the 15th October 1972. The evidence the Crown relied on to prove that the offence occurred during this period was the evidence of the complainant commencing at page 81.34 - 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘Q. Can you recall in relation to [the complainant’s half sister] being born how long before that happened that this particular event you’ve described in the television room happened? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. I do remember my mother and [the appellant] telling us that she was pregnant and going to have a baby around the time that incident had happened.  
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. Do you recall whether you were told that before or after? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. It was after – it was – it was only a matter of a few days or a week after. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. Do you have any recollection of your mother appearing to look pregnant at that stage? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. No I don’t. I – I wasn’t aware that she was pregnant – I overheard a conversation.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         [The] complainant’s [half] sister, was born on the 21st February 1973. If the time frame was the jury’s concern in relation to count 1 the only proper verdict was that of not guilty – an opinion advanced by the trial judge (TT 15/11/00 – 3.22). 
         
        
        
         
         In relation to count 2 the time frame was set as a result of the complainant’s evidence to the effect that the offence occurred a ‘few days’ before her 12th birthday – 28th September 1973 (TT – 82.12). Count 3 is dated as a result of the alleged offence occurring on the evening of the complainant’s 12th birthday (TT – 79.22). The time frame for count 4 is set in the context that the complainant’s aunty … was visiting the farm at the time of the alleged offence which [the aunt] confirmed (in her evidence) was for two weeks on or about the 27th February 1974 (TT – 151.4). Count 5 is set in the time frame that the complainant’s mother was in hospital giving birth to [the complainant’s half sister] (ie 21/2/73) on or about the time of the alleged offence – a fact not disputed by the appellant at his trial. 
         
        
        
         
         The different verdicts cannot be explained by the fact that the jury had a reasonable doubt that the alleged offences occurred on the date or within the time frame alleged as they would have returned a not guilty verdict in relation to count 1. One would have expected that, if this was the problem, of all the charges the jury would have convicted on would have been counts 2 and 3 – those allegedly occurring just prior to and on the complainant’s 12th birthday.” 
         
        
       
     46 The appellant submitted orally that the complainant’s mother would have learned of her pregnancy in late May 1972 and the complainant would have learned of it more than one week before 15 July 1972. Hence, “the jury unequivocally should have had a reasonable doubt in relation to that count and thus found the accused not guilty.” The appellant then submitted that since, if the jury were concerned about timing, they would have acquitted on count 1, and since they did not acquit, one or more of them must have been concerned about something else. The appellant submitted that this suggested that the jury’s concern was a concern about the complainant’s general credibility, perhaps stimulated by the conflict between her evidence that there was a television room distinct from the lounge room and that of her mother that there was not. If the jury were concerned about the complainant’s general credibility on matters other than timing, the difference in the outcome on the five counts is not explained by the fact that at the time of the events alleged in the fourth count the complainant’s aunt was staying with the complainant, and at the time of the events alleged in the fifth count the complainant’s mother was in hospital: these matters did not increase the reliability of the complainant’s evidence that the offences had been committed.  
      
       
     47 The Crown submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “It was logically possible, in conformity with the directions, for the jury to have accepted the complainant as a witness of truth but unreliable in her recollection of precisely when the offence occurred. This was not a case in which it could be concluded that a verdict of not guilty was indicative of the jury’s rejection of the complainant as a witness of truth. 
         
        
        
         
         Some insight into the effect of the directions about the need for specificity in the jury’s findings is recorded at SU 43 (15 November 2000). It is apparent that at least one juror was concerned whether the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt the very room in which the offence had occurred. 
         
        
        
         
         The jury was unable to return a verdict on the first count. It is apparent that the evidence of the time of the offence was difficult to establish. Her Honour summarised the Crown’s position at SU 21.7: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           … the Crown relies upon the evidence of the complainant that she remembers this happening a week either side of her mother telling her that she was pregnant with what turned out to be her sister … born on 21 February 1973. There is evidence that [her mother] fell pregnant in May 1972. The Crown argues that [her mother] would have been able to confirm that pregnancy about four weeks after falling pregnant, and then within a reasonable time frame would have told her children about it, not before July 1972, and by 15 October 1972 she would have been obviously pregnant and they could have worked it out for themselves. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         There was no request for re-direction or suggestion that her Honour’s perception was incorrect. That being the position it is not difficult to accept that the jury may have found itself speculating about a number of possible scenarios of when and how the pregnancy was disclosed. It is not difficult to understand why there may have been a schism on the timing among the jurors. 
         
        
        
         
         The time frame alleged in the second count was dictated by the complainant’s recollection that the offence occurred two weeks either side of her 12th birthday, which was on 28 September 1973. She said that her mother was not at home but had told the complainant, in a telephone conversation, where her present was (T 79.40). She believed that her mother had telephoned her from Sydney (T 101.6). The mother … denied being absent from the house on the complainant’s birthday (T 208.25). 
         
        
        
         
         In directing the jury her Honour again made it quite clear that there was a dispute about the time. She reminded the jury that [the complainant’s mother] had said that she might have been visiting her sister, as asserted by the complainant, but that it was in November 1972 (SU 23.2). Her Honour also warned the jury that if a reasonable doubt existed about when the incident occurred, they were obliged to acquit (SU 23.5). 
         
        
        
         
         There was evidence independent of the complainant that there may have been an occasion upon which [the complainant’s mother] was in Sydney visiting her sister. The acquittal is consistent with the jury not being satisfied when the offence occurred although not having any doubt that it did. It cannot be [inferred] from the verdict that the jury found the complainant to be unreliable other than in relation to the time of the offence. 
         
        
        
         
         The third count alleged an offence on the date of the complainant’s twelfth birthday on 28 September 1973. The competing evidence of the surrounding circumstances is virtually the same as in count 2. The area of dispute was whether [the complainant’s mother] was at home on the occasion or, as claimed by the complainant, she was in Sydney. Her Honour directed the jury that if they had a reasonable doubt about the event having occurred on 28 September 1973 they should acquit. It is open to conclude that the jury did have a doubt about the time and, consistent with the directions, entered a verdict of not guilty. 
         
        
        
         
         The Appellant was found guilty of counts 4 and 5. In relation to the former the significant memory was the unusual occurrence of the complainant’s aunt … staying at the family home. The offence was alleged to have occurred between 1 February and 14 March 1974. [The aunt’s] evidence was significant in that she confirmed that she was at the house in 1974 because she was working in a nearby vineyard. She said that on 27 February 1974, her birthday, she was injured by a vine twig entering her ear (T 150.45). She said she stayed at the [appellant’s] home for two weeks (T 151.7). Under cross-examination she rejected the suggestion that she was not staying there at that time (T 152.5). 
         
        
        
         
         It was open to the jury to accept that there was independent evidence of the time at which the offence was said to have occurred. If the jury was satisfied that the complainant’s evidence on this point was confirmed and accepted that the offence did occur there was a proper basis for a guilty verdict.  
         
        
        
         
         Count 5 alleged an indecent assault between 15 February and 15 March 1973. One of the reference points relied upon by the complainant was that her mother was in hospital for the birth of her child … . There did not appear to be any dispute that the child was born on 21 February 1973. The complainant also recalled that her grandparents were staying at her home and that an occasion arose when she needed to have a permission note signed (T109.47). 
         
        
        
         
         It was open to the jury to accept that on this occasion the complainant’s recollection of time was accurate and that there was independent evidence supporting her on that point. The jury then had to decide whether to accept that the offence occurred. They clearly did. 
         
        
        
         
         This was a case in which there was considerable dispute about the time at which various things occurred. This aspect occupied a significant part of the trial. The jury was left with no doubt that the occurrence of the acts constituting the offences alone was not sufficient to support a guilty verdict. The jury had to be satisfied that the events occurred within the specific time frame alleged in the indictment. 
         
        
        
         
         The jury received clear warnings about accepting the complainant’s evidence and it must be assumed that it proceeded in accordance with those directions. The verdicts can be interpreted as reflecting a situation in which the complainant’s veracity was accepted, but there were reasonable doubts about the timing. The benefit of that doubt was properly extended to the Appellant. There is however no basis for concluding that the findings of guilt were other than indicative of the jury’s thorough consideration of the evidence and an acceptance that the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt each element of the offences.” 
         
        
       
     48 The first issue to be dealt with relates to the first count. The Crown’s submission that it was possible for some jurors to be satisfied of the time beyond a reasonable doubt while others were not appears to be correct. There is nothing suspicious in the jury’s failure to find a verdict of not guilty. The vagueness about the time when the complainant overheard a conversation about her mother’s pregnancy, and the indeterminate nature of the Crown argument put to the jury on this point, explained why some jurors could experience a reasonable doubt.  
      
       
     49 The second issue relates to the period concerning the second count and the date of the third count. These were defined by reference to the complainant’s birthday, 28 September 1973. In view of the sharp conflict between the complainant and her mother on whether the mother was away, and on whether the complainant was confusing another period when the mother was visiting her sister in November 1972, it was open to the jury to experience a reasonable doubt about the timing of the alleged incident.  
      
       
     50 The third issue relates to the timing of the incident charged in count 4. The key event said by the complainant to affect the timing was the visit of the complainant’s aunt to the family home. This aspect of the complainant’s evidence, unlike the evidence relating to counts 1-3, was confirmed by the aunt. The aunt was called by the Crown, but, not surprisingly, was a reluctant witness. She refused to answer some questions on the voir dire, she showed a strong animus against the complainant, and she said she would refuse to answer various questions before the jury. When the jury came in, she initially refused to be sworn in front of them. However, apart from the last event, the aunt’s conduct took place in the jury’s absence. Her evidence that she was in the complainant’s house for two weeks around 27 February 1974 was given precisely: she admitted having once thought the year was 1973, but explained to the jury both how she came to date the year correctly and how, by reference to her birthday and her injury, she fixed on the day correctly. The evidence before the jury was capable of being accepted by them, and must have been accepted by them. The jury’s acceptance of her evidence is rendered the safer because of what the jury did not know – her hostility to the complainant. In short, the point of distinction between counts 1-3 and count 4 is that in relation to timing there was a lack of evidence confirming the complainant’s evidence on counts 1-3, but there was confirmatory evidence on count 4.  
      
       
     51 Fourthly, the complainant fixed the time frame for count 5 by reference to the fact that her mother was in hospital giving birth to the complainant’s half sister. The appellant’s written submissions said that that fact was not disputed by the appellant at the trial; nor is it disputed now. That makes it more probable that the complainant’s evidence that her grandmother’s de facto spouse was staying with her was correct. That in turn gives credibility to the complainant’s contention that when she needed a permission note to be signed and her grandmother would not do it, she went into her stepfather’s bedroom for him to sign it. Again, like count 4, count 5 is distinguishable from counts 1-3 by reason of the fact that the complainant’s evidence about the timing of it, unlike her evidence in relation to counts 1-3, is confirmed by independent evidence.  
      
       
     52 Hence, contrary to the appellant’s submissions, it can be concluded that the surrounding circumstances relating to counts 4 and 5, which were absent in relation to counts 1-3, offered a reasonable basis for comfort in their soundness. The fact that the jury acted as it did on counts 1-3 does not suggest that it should have experienced reasonable doubt on counts 4 and 5.  
      
       
     53 Ground 5 is rejected. 
      
       
        
       Ground 6: reasonable doubt on complainant’s evidence on one count to be considered in assessing her general credibility 
        
       
     54 In R v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290 at [185]-[191] Spigelman CJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Nevertheless, the case law on inconsistent verdicts, particularly in the context of sexual assault cases but not limited to that context, indicates that there is a recurring difficulty in this respect. It may appear to be obvious that a reasonable doubt about one aspect of a complainant’s evidence ought to be taken into account when assessing that witness’s evidence on other matters. However, there have been a significant number of cases in which courts of criminal appeal have acted on the basis that the jury may have failed to do so. 
         
        
        
         
         In the light of the number of cases it is desirable that the traditional direction as to treating each count separately is supplemented in a word against word case. Some reference ought to be made to the effect upon the assessment of the credibility of a complainant if the jury finds itself unable to accept the complainant’s evidence with respect to any count. 
         
        
        
         
         Some form of direction assisting the jury in this respect should be given … ‘as a general rule’. Its absence is not necessarily fatal … . Furthermore, as the joint judgment in Crofts [v R (1996) 186 CLR 427] affirmed, the ‘general rule’ does not apply ‘where the peculiar facts of the case and the conduct of the trial do not suggest the need for a warning to restore a balance of fairness’ (at 451).  
         
        
        
         
         It is not necessary to specify any precise words for such a direction. That will depend on the circumstances of the case. It will often be appropriate to direct a jury that where they entertain a reasonable doubt concerning the truthfulness or reliability of a complainant’s evidence in relation to one or more counts, that must be taken into account in assessing the truthfulness or reliability of the complainant’s evidence generally 
         
        
        
         
         On other occasions it may be appropriate for a judge to indicate to the jury, whilst making it clear that it remains a matter for the jury, that it might think that there was nothing to distinguish the evidence of the complainant on one count from his or her evidence on another count. 
         
        
        
         
         Or it may be appropriate to indicate that, if the jury has a reasonable doubt about the complainant’s credibility in relation to one count, it might believe it difficult to see how the evidence of the complainant could be accepted in relation to other counts. 
         
        
        
         
         The precise terminology must remain a matter for the trial judge in all the particular circumstances of the specific case. The crucial matter is to indicate to the jury that any doubt they may form with respect to one aspect of the complainant’s evidence, ought be considered by them when assessing the overall credibility of the complainant and, therefore, when deciding whether or not there was a reasonable doubt about the complainant’s evidence with respect to other counts.” 
         
        
       
     55 The appellant submitted that the trial judge did not give any relevant direction and that there was nothing to suggest that the jury followed that course of its own volition. He submitted that the direction was imperative because of the extent to which the complainant’s evidence was contradicted. 
      
       
     56 The contradictions contended for were as follows. 
      
       
     57 First, in her evidence in chief about the first of the uncharged acts, the complainant said that the incident took place after the elastic failed in her underwear and she asked the appellant for a safety pin. In cross-examination she conceded that this detail had not been mentioned in her statements to the police dated 11 January 1999 and 21 October 1999. 
      
       
     58 Secondly, in her evidence in chief about the second of the uncharged acts, the complainant said that the appellant used paraffin oil to assist penetration. The complainant’s mother denied that paraffin oil was ever used in the house or around the farm, and denied that there were oils of any kind in the kitchen area. 
      
       
     59 Thirdly, in her evidence in chief about the second of the uncharged acts, the complainant said that the appellant was wearing pyjamas and a winter dressing gown with a tartan pattern. The complainant’s mother said it was not the appellant’s practice to wear pyjamas and a dressing gown around the house, and that he did not own a dressing gown at the relevant time. 
      
       
     60 Fourthly, the complainant said that the events charged in relation to the first count took place in a room opposite the bathroom in which there was a small portable television set. The complainant’s mother said that at that time the family had only one television set, that it was kept in the corner of the lounge room, and that there was no television in the nursery.  
      
       
     61 Fifthly, in relation to the third count, the complainant said that she had been given a matching nightie and brunch coat by her mother, who was away at the time, for her birthday, and the incident happened after the appellant asked her to try it on. The complainant’s mother denied the proposition that the complainant was ever given “a nightie and dressing gown as a birthday present”, said she could not afford such a present, and said she was not away for the relevant birthday. 
      
       
     62 Sixthly, the complainant said that the incident relating to the third count took place on a fold down lounge in the lounge room. The complainant’s mother denied that the lounge folded down. 
      
       
     63 These contradictions were said to have made the direction in question “imperative”. However, the mere fact that there were conflicts between the complainant and her mother does not establish that the complainant’s evidence was wrong or that it made the direction imperative. The complainant’s mother had a strong material interest in supporting the appellant, and probably a strong emotional interest as well. The jury might well have formed the view that it was easy for the mother to advance a series of denials, most of which were bare in their nature.  
      
       
     64 The warning suggested by the Chief Justice in R v Markuleski  was not said by him to be mandatory. In particular he said that it need not be given where the particular facts of the case and the conduct of the trial do not suggest that it is needed to restore a balance of fairness.  
      
       
     65 It would have been obvious to the jury that at all material points the appellant contradicted the complainant, and that on several points of detail the complainant’s mother contradicted the complainant. 
      
       
     66 The trial judge said that she did not propose to refer to all the evidence, and that the mere fact that she referred to some parts and not others did not mean that the jury were not entitled to give weight to any evidence not referred to which they thought significant. 
      
       
     67 The trial judge told the jury that they did not have to accept the whole of a particular witness’s evidence or reject the whole of it. (It followed that she was telling them that they could accept the complainant’s evidence on counts 4 and 5 but not the others.) She gave directions about factors bearing on the honesty and accuracy of witnesses, one of which was “whether or not a witness has some axe to grind, or someone to protect”. (Thus she was telling them they might give no weight to the evidence of the complainant’s mother, which, in the respects now relied on by the appellant, went either to uncharged incidents or counts 1-3.)  
      
       
     68 The trial judge reminded the jury of the burden and standard of proof. 
      
       
     69 The trial judge said that it was open to the jury to convict on some counts but not others, if, in relation to the latter, they had a reasonable doubt about the timing.  
      
       
     70 The conflict in the evidence about where the complainant’s mother was at the time of her twelfth birthday was specifically put to the jury.  
      
       
     71 The trial judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “There is also one other very important direction that I want to give you now. To prove this case the Crown relies entirely on the evidence of [the complainant]. Without her there is no Crown case against the accused. There is no independent evidence capable of supporting the evidence which has been given to you by [the complainant]. For example, there is no evidence of witnesses to the events – although that is not unusual in allegations of sexual assault. There is no medical evidence, for example, in relation to [the complainant], which might be capable of supporting her allegation that she had been penetrated by the accused. There is no evidence of her telling anybody about these events at the time they occurred. This sort of material was referred to by Mr Johnston as ‘corroborating evidence’, although I would rather use the term ‘supporting evidence’, and I must tell you that as a matter of law there is no requirement that the complainant’s evidence be corroborated by any other evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         However, I do give you this direction and warning, that where the whole of a Crown case depends on the evidence of one witness alone, you must scrutinise that witness’ evidence with great care and caution, for it may be dangerous to convict on the evidence of one witness alone. This is more so in this trial because of the length of time that has elapsed between the events complained of and the time [the complainant] made her statements to the police and gave her evidence to you, somewhere between twenty-five and twenty-eight years, depending on which charge you are looking at. The consequences of such a delay are, no doubt, obvious to you. But one of them is that it renders it very difficult for the accused to be able to defend such an allegation by putting evidence before you which might cause you to have a reasonable doubt about the truth of the allegations, or to have any specific memory of particular surrounding events at the time. For example, the length of time would have made it difficult, if not impossible, for the accused to call any evidence which might, for example, have suggested that he was elsewhere on a particular day, or during a particular period, and thus he either had an alibi or a reduced opportunity to commit the offences alleged. 
         
        
        
         
         Further, I warn you that because the evidence is being given by the complainant of events which occurred such a long time ago, on the basis of her memory of these events, and that she is giving evidence as an adult of events which she said happened to her as a child, that this may well make her evidence unreliable. 
         
        
        
         
         For these reasons you would need to scrutinise the evidence of [the complainant] with great caution before you would be prepared to convict, because, as a result of those matters which I have just raised, and for other more specific matters in relation to her evidence, which I will come to very briefly soon, it may be dangerous to convict on the basis of that evidence alone.  
         
        
        
         
         I am not saying, in giving you that warning, that you are not entitled to convict a person, or that a person is not entitled to be convicted on the basis of one witness’ evidence alone. That is not so. I am simply reminding you of the heavy onus which the Crown bears throughout the whole of the trial to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, and where to do so it relies on the evidence of one witness alone, given in relation to events that occurred such a long time ago, that witness’ evidence must be scrutinised with great caution before you would be prepared to convict the accused.” 
         
        
       
     72 The trial judge then summarised various aspects of the complainant’s evidence on which the appellant relied, among them the failure to mention the elastic and the safety pin to the police, the controversy as to whether there was a second television set or a television room, and the controversy about whether the lounge could be folded out. 
      
       
     73 Throughout the trial judge made it plain that it was open to the jury to convict or acquit on all or any combination of the counts.  
      
       
     74 While the trial judge did not in terms tell the jury that if they experienced a reasonable doubt about one aspect of the complainant’s evidence that could be taken into account in assessing her evidence on other matters, the circumstances did not call for it. The directions were sufficient to make it plain that the complainant’s evidence could be accepted in part. They were also, and very strongly, warned of the need for all of it to be scrutinised with care. The difficulties arising from the lateness and incompleteness of complaint, the antiquity of the events in issue, and the conflicts with the complainant’s mother were all explored. These directions sufficiently averted any danger that the jury would approach their task by dividing the five counts and the other issues into watertight compartments. If the complainant’s evidence was, as the trial judge suggested, to be scrutinised with great care, it was inevitable that a failure to accept the complainant on some points would have to be considered in relation to others.  
      
       
     75 A reading of the summing up suggests that it approaches a model for this kind of case. On appeal no complaint was made about any particular part of it. Nor was any complaint about any particular part of it made at the trial. More specifically, at the trial counsel for the appellant did not ask for the direction now contended for before the summing up began; and he did not ask for it to be given either when it concluded on 14 November or before the jury began their deliberations at 9am on 15 November 2000. It may be inferred that the silence of counsel is to be attributed to a consciousness on his part that it was as fair a summing up as possible from the appellant’s point of view. 
      
       
     76 Wood CJ at CL’s observations about the suggested direction in R v Markuleski at [263] should be noted: 
      
       
        
         
         “In some cases, where it is obvious that the witness’s reliability or credibility has been seriously undermined, in relation to one count, a strong comment may be appropriate. In other cases, it may be appropriate to indicate to the jury that they may have a difficulty in accepting the witness’s evidence on some counts, or on particular counts, if they have a reasonable doubt about his or her reliability in relation to the other counts. In other cases a more neutral reminder of the entitlement of the jury to take such matter into account may suffice. In yet other cases, it may not be necessary to say anything.” 
         
        
       
     77 In this case it cannot be said that the complainant’s evidence was seriously undermined on one particular count. Her evidence on timing was more capable of rational acceptance on counts 4 and 5 than it was on counts 1, 2 or 3 because it was supported by other witnesses or circumstances, but it does not follow that her evidence on counts 1, 2 or 3 whether in relation to timing or otherwise was “seriously undermined” as distinct from being such as to create a reasonable doubt in the minds of some of the jury on count 1 and in the minds of all of them on counts 2 and 3. Nor was this a case where a difficulty in accepting the complainant on one matter might arise if a reasonable doubt was experienced about her reliability on another. This case falls into the last category identified by the Chief Judge – the category of cases where it was not necessary to say anything.  
      
       
     78 Ground 6 is rejected.

    70013/01 - REGINA v Stuart Cecil MARSH 
     
      
    SENTENCE 
     
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, Stuart Marsh, has pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Lanh Ngoc Bui. He has also pleaded guilty to being in company with his co-offender, Clarke, to rob Ms Bui of her handbag and a further offence of take and drive a conveyance without the consent of the owner. 
     
      
    2 On or about 28 July 2000 the offender stole a Ford Falcon, registration number UPM 844 from Aurelia Street, Toongabbie. On the evening of 3 August 2000 he was driving the car when he collected Wayne Clarke, who has previously been sentenced in relation to these matters. The two of them embarked upon an enterprise intending to rob a person of a handbag. Marsh drove the vehicle with Clarke as his passenger to Lidcombe via Strathfield looking for a victim to rob. 
     
      
    3 The deceased Lanh Bui, had attended Lidcombe Club with her boyfriend Tri Dung Tran, where they had dinner. They left the Club at approximately 9 pm and walked a short distance to Tran’s unit at 16-20 Swete Street, Lidcombe. Mr Tran went inside to collect his car keys whilst Ms Bui waited outside the unit on the driveway/footpath area. 
     
      
    4 While she was waiting Marsh drove the stolen car into Swete Street. He stopped the vehicle approximately fifty metres from where Ms Bui was standing and Clarke got out of the vehicle, approached Ms Bui and grabbed her handbag. Marsh continued to drive the vehicle alongside Clarke and Ms Bui. Clarke opened the passenger door and sat on the front passenger seat. Ms Bui pursued Clarke and attempted to retrieve her handbag. Marsh began driving down Swete Street and initially Ms Bui ran alongside the vehicle for a short distance. Marsh briefly stopped the vehicle and Ms Bui partially entered it. Marsh then accelerated and drove the vehicle down Swete Street, swerving from side to side in an attempt to release Ms Bui. The offender then drove the vehicle through the roundabout at the corner of Church Street, clipping the gutter as he made the turn. 
     
      
    5 Ms Bui had hold of Clarke’s head and this protected her from falling. The offender, whilst driving, leaned across and punched Ms Bui to the head a number of times in an endeavour to release her from the vehicle. Approximately forty metres from the roundabout in Church Street, Ms Bui fell from the vehicle, rolled onto the roadway and the rear tyre of the vehicle struck her head. 
     
      
    6 Ms Bui was found unconscious and was transported by ambulance to Westmead hospital where she died at approximately 1.20 am on the morning of 4 August as a consequence of her head injuries. 
     
      
    7 After the robbery, the offender and Clarke drove to Thomas Street, Parramatta where they searched Ms Bui’s handbag, recovering $15 in cash. They then discarded the handbag and small items from it in a bin at the rear of the unit complex situated at 1-3 Thomas Street. Those items were later recovered. 
     
      
    8 The stolen vehicle was also later recovered and it was found to contain items relating to the offender. 
     
      
    9 On Tuesday, 8 August 2000 Clarke’s solicitor contacted police and indicated that Clarke wished to speak about his involvement in the matter. The police attended at the solicitors’ office where, after enquires had been made, Clarke was arrested, later participating in an ERISP interview and a video recorded re-enactment of the events of the night of 3 August 2000. He gave a detailed account of what had taken place which included the offender’s involvement and indicated his willingness to assist the Crown by giving evidence at the trial of the offender. As I have indicated, Clarke has since been sentenced by me for his involvement in this crime. 
     
      
    10 The offender was arrested, in relation to other matters, on 20 August 2000. On 24 August 2000 Det Bourchier interviewed the offender in relation to the current offence. On 14 September 2000 the offender was charged and refused bail in relation to the other matters. On 17 October, whilst on remand at the Metropolitan Remand Centre, the offender was taken and held at the Parramatta court complex on the pretext of speaking to a detective regarding another offence. Whilst held in the cells between 8 am and 6 pm he was legally recorded as talking to some other prisoners about the events, which led to Ms Bui’s death. In that conversation he confirmed the account given by Clarke to the police, including the fact that whilst making their escape he had punched the deceased a number of times in an attempt to dislodge her from the car while she was clinging to Clarke’s head. 
     
      
    11 On 17 November 2000 the offender took part in an ERISP with police. He initially denied he had any involvement in the events on 3 August 2000. Parts of the recordings made by police on 17 October 2000 were played to the offender and he was also asked to read an extract from a transcript of that recording. After this was done he declined to be interviewed further in relation to the matter and he was then charged. 
     
      
    12 When sentencing Clarke I said: 
     
      
       
        
        “To describe the events as a ‘robbery gone wrong’ is to seriously understate the seriousness of the crime. As a result of the illegal activity of the offender and his companion, an innocent nineteen-year-old woman has lost her life. In expressing the court’s sympathy to Ms Bui’s family I am deeply conscious that no words are adequate in these terrible circumstances. I have read and appreciate the contents of the victim impact statements. I appreciate the enormous grief of the loss of such a loved daughter and sister brings in these circumstances.” 
        
       
      
    13 I can only repeat those works today. 
     
      
    14 I have previously indicated that sentencing for manslaughter is a difficult process. The range of sentence is greater than for almost any other offence. The maximum penalty is twenty-five years imprisonment. In Georgina Marie Hill v R 3 A Crim R 397 the Chief Justice said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The circumstances leading to the felonious taking of human life being regarded as manslaughter rather than murder can vary infinitely, and it is not always easy to determine in any given case what should be done in the matter of sentence. At the start it should be recognised that the felonious taking of a human life is recognised both in the  
        Crimes Act 
         1900 and in the community at large as one of the most dreadful crimes in the criminal calendar. The courts have, however, over the decades gradually manifested a willingness to recognise factual contexts which provide some basis for understanding the human tragedies that can lead to the taking of a life. The manifestation of this humanitarian tendency is necessarily attended by the utmost caution. It can be seen to be constantly written in the decisions of the courts and in the enactments of the legislature that the taking of a human life is a grave action calling for a correspondingly grave measure of criminal justice being meted out to the guilty party. 
        
       
       
        
        It is necessary to evaluate the demands of the criminal justice system, the expectations of the community at large, the subjective circumstances of the prisoner coming forward for criminal judgment and the interest of society in protecting itself and its members from criminal activity amounting, as in the present case, to the taking of a life."" 
         
        
       
      
    15 It is necessary for me when determining the penalty, which it is appropriate to impose, to have regard to the objective elements of the criminality of the acts which led to Ms Bui’s death. In this respect the involvement of the offender is significantly greater than that of Clarke. The offender actively initiated the criminal escapade which resulted in Ms Bui’s death and as the driver of the car, was responsible for the acts which endeavoured to shake her free and struck the blows to her head which contributed to her ultimately falling from the car. 
     
      
    16 The Crown has accepted the plea of manslaughter and accordingly the offender cannot be sentenced on the basis that he intended, by his acts, to kill or cause grievous bodily harm nor that he acted with reckless indifference to human life. However, the offender is guilty of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. 
     
      
    17 I should also indicate that when I come to the imposition of the sentence I cannot, of course, have regard to the victim impact statements. 
     
      
    18 I indicated, when sentencing Clarke, that there is a great need for the sentence which is imposed to be sufficient to deter and discourage others from carrying out crimes which may involve a risk to human life. The snatching of bags from pedestrians always creates a risk to their safety. But that risk is significantly increased when a motor vehicle is part of the overall plan. The community is entitled to expect that people can use the pedestrian pathways without fear of their property being taken and their lives threatened. 
     
      
    19 The tragedy which resulted in the death of Lanh Ngoc Bui occurred when the offender and Clarke, at the suggestion of the offender, decided to rob her. Once the enterprise had started to go wrong, and Ms Bui was caught up, the offender continued to drive the vehicle, swerving from side to side, and when Ms Bui had not fallen, he reached across and hit her. Following these events she fell from the vehicle. The objective criminality of the offender’s actions is significantly greater than those of Clarke. 
     
      
    20 The offender had control of the vehicle and could have stopped to release Ms Bui. Instead he continued moving whilst attempting to remove her from the vehicle. But for these actions, although Ms Bui may have been injured, it is most unlikely that she would have died. 
     
      
    21 Whereas Clarke surrendered himself to police and revealed his identity, the offender did not. Upon being interviewed by police he denied any involvement in the crime. I conclude that the current plea reflects the offender’s recognition that having regard to the fact that Clarke indicated that he would give evidence against the offender at his trial there was little alternative but to plead guilty. 
     
      
    22 I am not satisfied that the offender originally showed any remorse for the events in which he participated although he ultimately pleaded guilty thereby avoiding the necessity for a trial. 
     
      
    23 The report by Anita Duffy, a consulting psychologist, suggests the offender now has some insight into the extent of his criminality. His plea of guilty otherwise has a modest impact upon the ultimate sentence. In my opinion, the plea of guilty entitles the offender to an allowance of twenty percent. 
     
      
    24 The offender is now aged thirty-two years of age, having been born on 26 March 1969, and at the time of the offence was unemployed. He has a dreadful criminal history. The sentences which have been imposed upon him reflect attempts by courts to provide him with an opportunity to avoid a life of crime. However, the opportunities which have been given to him have been successively squandered and he has progressively engaged in more serious criminal activity. There can be little doubt that his criminal activities have been made more necessary by his involvement with illicit drugs. There must now be serious doubt whether he can ever rehabilitate himself.  
     
      
    25 His record includes convictions for stealing commencing in 1982, drug offences, some minor offences, serious assault matters, motor vehicle related matters, one matter involving an escape from custody and others. 
     
      
    26 As I indicated, Anita Duffy has interviewed the offender and provided a report which was tendered before me. It is appropriate that I repeat some of the material provided in that report: 
     
      
    27 Ms Duffy identifies that the offender was born in 1969. He is the second youngest in his family, having two older brothers, two older sisters and a younger brother. The three youngest brothers have all had an involvement with drugs and alcohol and Stuart’s older brother is apparently, presently, or was, at the time of the report, in custody and another brother has also spent some time in custody. The offender’s father was an alcoholic who was very violent to his mother and to the children of the family. The mother left the relationship when the offender was ten years of age. The offender continued to live with his mother and saw his father on rare occasions. His father died in 1999. Apparently, the offender’s mother does not enjoy good health and does not visit him in gaol, although they do speak on the telephone. The offender has contact with his brothers and one of his sisters but not the other. 
     
      
    28 The offender went to Riverstone Primary School where he experienced learning difficulties, particularly with reading and maths. He truanted from school and was sent to Ormond Boys Home at Thornleigh on two occasions for periods of months. He reported to Ms Duffy that he enjoyed Ormond, feeling far more comfortable there than he did at home. 
     
      
    29 He went to further institutions in his teenage years and commenced schooling at Riverstone High School. However, he did not complete even the first year before he was sent to the Darruk institutions after a car stealing charge. He reports that he learned “ a little bit” there. 
     
      
    30 The picture thereafter appears to be one of involvement with a variety of criminal activities, together with a number of his friends. His life pattern appears to be one of drugs, crime and boys’ homes. 
     
      
    31 For a time he held a casual job at the Flemington markets and for a time, also, he worked as an assistant to a pastry cook. 
     
      
    32 The offender formed a de facto relationship when he was about seventeen and he has three children, all boys, aged fourteen, twelve and ten. The relationship has come to an end. Apparently his sons visit him in gaol and express to their father their disappointment that he continually ends up in custody. Ms Duffy says that at least they may be having some influence on their father who has expressed, at least, a recognition of his plight and a desire to become a better father to the boys in the future. 
     
      
    33 Apparently when the offender came into custody in relation to the present matter he detoxed from drugs. He has recently embarked on group programs provided run by drug and alcohol counsellors. 
     
      
    34 The offender is “one out” and held in strict protection. Ms Duffy says that he now expresses remorse and sorrow, some empathy and concern for Ms Bui’s family and their grievous loss. 
     
      
    35 In her conclusions Ms Duffy says this: 
     
      
       
        
        “Stuart’s presentation at our interview, the results of objective personality assessment as well as his general history indicate he has experienced recurring symptoms of depression since childhood, in response to his disconsolate family circumstances. Coming from a family with a violent alcoholic father, where Stuart and his siblings were both witnesses to violence perpetrated on their mother and where Stuart himself was the butt of his father’s aggression all had long term adverse effects on his emotional and social development. His desire to avoid home life was so intense that he preferred the relative safety and security of Ormond Boys Home. He remembers being treated well there and he felt ‘comfortable’ and he was given things that he did not or could not receive at home such as material possessions, outings and excursions. 
        
       
       
        
        From a very young age, Stuart used alcohol and was introduced to heroin even prior to his teens. He tended to mix with friends whose older relatives provided them with drugs and he became involved in the drug taking and criminal subculture extremely young in life. He has had a number of admissions to Juvenile Justice institutions and this continued when he reached adulthood and he spent much of his time in gaol. He shows some evidence of institutionalisation in that he did not find gaol threatening or difficult up to now despite experiences of assault by other inmates. 
        
       
       
        
        He continued the pattern of drug taking even whilst in custody and always returned to using heroin as soon as he left gaol. Heroin appears to have been the means whereby he could cope with life effectively, by escaping from his problems through temporary experiences of euphoria. Most of his criminal record has been related to activities to finance his drug habit, and he has served sentences for stealing and break and enter charges. The offence with which he is charged seems somewhat inconsistent with his history, and may have been a product of a number of events, namely his desire for heroin and the fact that he was travelling with his co-defendant who suggested he stop the car in order to rob the victim. The victim however did not relinquish her bag, and indeed was carried along on the car by the co-defendant when she attempted to enter the car. Stuart’s response to this was to panic. He attempted to shake her off and punched her in order to make her let go of the bag and of his co-defendant. The tragic episode ended when the victim fell from the car and was subsequently injured and died later of head injuries.” 
        
       
      
    36 She continues: 
     
      
       
        
        “Stuart expresses remorse and consternation over his role in these events. He admits that he ‘freaked out’ and ‘panicked’ and after he found out she had died, felt very ‘shattered’. 
        
       
       
        
        Since his arrest, Stuart has been kept in Strict Protection. He is depressed, extremely anxious and vigilant to threat and harm and as he says has been ‘doing it hard’ reflecting constantly over why he took part in such an act. To his credit, he is undertaking drug and alcohol courses whilst in custody and is currently embarking on a more intensive group program to facilitate communication skills and discuss more painful and deeper issues underlying his long history of substance dependence. Stuart has always found it difficult to air his feelings and disclose his problems, and his participation in this group appears to be a significant and positive step necessary for any rehabilitation process. 
        
       
       
        
        It is thought that whilst in custody he will require intervention to work on social skills and assertiveness training, improve his self concept and prevent the possibility of self harm. Relapse prevention must be a necessary part of this procedure, as Stuart is now highly motivated to cease the destructive cycle of drugs and crime. Over his years in custody, he may have developed a sense of helplessness and to foster any progress he may need to participate in programmes not only involving personal development but also educational and vocational skills, to help him find employment when he leaves. He will be by then probably highly institutionalised, and may require preparation both within custody and upon his release to facilitate his adjustment back into society. Close probation and parole supervision would be extremely important at this stage.” 
        
       
      
    37 Having regard to the circumstances of the offence and the degree of criminality involved, a sentence at the high end of the available range, in my opinion, is appropriate. I am of the view that this should be a sentence of thirteen years full time imprisonment. However, having regard to the plea entered by the offender this sentence should be discounted by twenty percent, making the appropriate sentence ten years and four months. 
     
      
    38 Having regard to the circumstances of the offender I see no reason why I should find special circumstances justifying a non-parole period greater than the statute provides. 
     
      
    39 The offender has also pleaded guilty to one count of robbery in company contrary to s 98 of the Crimes Act. The offence carries a penalty of twenty years imprisonment. The crime being central to the offence of manslaughter carries the same significant degree of criminality. However, I am mindful of the fact that no weapon was involved. 
     
      
    40 Allowing for the plea of guilty and the other matters to which I have referred, I believe a fixed term of six years is appropriate in relation to this matter, which must be served concurrently with the sentence in relation to the charge of manslaughter. 
     
      
    41 The offender has also pleaded guilty to taking a motor vehicle contrary to s 154A(1)(a) of the Crimes Act. The penalty (the offence being larceny) is a maximum of five years imprisonment. Again, having regard to the plea of guilty and the other matters, I believe for this offence a fixed term of fourteen months is appropriate which must be served concurrently with the sentence on the charge of manslaughter. 
     
      
    42 Mr Marsh you have pleaded guilty to the offences of manslaughter, robbery in company and larceny of a motor vehicle. I have heard and taken into account all of the matters that have been put by counsel on your behalf. I have had regard to the circumstances in which the offences occurred, your pleas of guilty and your personal circumstances. 
     
      
    43 You are convicted of manslaughter. You are sentenced to a term of ten years and four months full-time imprisonment to commence on 17 November 2000 and expiring on 16 March 2011. I fix a non-parole period of seven years and nine months. Accordingly you will be eligible for release on parole on 16 August 2008. 
     
      
    44 With respect to the charge of robbery in company you are convicted and sentenced to a fixed term of six years full-time imprisonment to commence on 17 November 2000 and expiring on 16 November 2006, the sentence to be served concurrently with the sentence for manslaughter. 
     
      
    45 With respect to the charge of taking a motor vehicle contrary to s 154A(1)(a) you are convicted and sentenced to a fixed term of fourteen months full-time imprisonment to commence on 17 November 2000 and expiring on 16 March 2002, that sentence again to be served concurrently with the sentence for manslaughter.

      REGINA v. GORDON ANDREW DUNCOMBE 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
     1 SHELLER, JA: I agree with Greg James, J. 
      
       
     2 DOWD, J: I agree with Greg James, J. 
      
       
     3 GREG JAMES, J: This is an appeal by the New South Wales Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s.5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against sentences pronounced on the respondent in the District Court at Albury on 6 September 2001 by Patten DCJ. 
      
       
     4 The respondent, Gordon Andrew Duncombe was sentenced on two counts, one of assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty, and one of break enter and steal on 1 November 2000. He had pleaded guilty to these charges. 
      
       
     5 In addition, he sought that the court take into account, which it did, various charges on a Form 1 comprising five counts of receiving, two counts each of break enter and steal and drive whilst licence cancelled and one count each of drive with the special range prescribed concentration of alcohol, drive whilst unlicensed, use unregistered vehicle and use uninsured vehicle. These offences were taken into account on the sentence for the crime of break enter and steal. The offences of receiving, drive while licence cancelled, drive while unlicensed and that of drive with the special range prescribed concentration of alcohol were factually unrelated to the facts of the offences charged in the indictment. 
      
       
     6 The offender had pleaded guilty when arraigned before the trial judge. 
      
       
     7 The offence of break enter and steal is punishable, in the absence of aggravating circumstances, by a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years; that of assaulting a police officer by a maximum penalty of imprisonment for five years. 
      
       
     8 His Honour sentenced the respondent as follows:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""Upon the charge of assaulting Mr. Thomas, a police officer in the execution of his duty, I sentence him to imprisonment for six months and two weeks, the sentence to commence on 2 November 2000 and expire on 15 May 2001. 
         
        
        
         
         Upon the charge of break enter and steal from the shop of Mr. Thomas, trading as the Rand General Store at Kindra Street, Rand, I take into account the charges on the Form 1. I sentence the prisoner to imprisonment for a term of three years, to commence from 15 May 2001 and expire on 14 May 2004. I set a non-parole period of nine months, which will expire on 14 February 2002, and I direct that the prisoner be admitted to parole on that date."" 
         
        
       
     9 The learned trial judge found the facts of the offences in accordance with the submissions put to him by the Crown. In summary, his findings were that the respondent, together with co-offenders, drove in a motor vehicle bearing stolen number plates from Albury to Rand where the co-offenders broke into and stole from the Rand Bowling Club, the Rand Rural Supplies Store and the Rand General Store. 
      
       
     10 The respondent assisted by carrying the goods from the first two premises. The respondent had agreed to drive the others, as he was aware he would receive money from their enterprise. 
      
       
     11 From the bowling club they stole a number of kegs and slabs of beer and a small sum of money. From the rural supply shop they stole some cash, oil and grease-based products. From the general store they stole a quantity of cigarettes, cigarette lighters and $218 in cash. 
      
       
     12 The respondent had previously warned the others that the general store was owned by a police officer who resided in an attached house. Awakened by the activities of the thieves, the officer confronted them. They ran to the van where the respondent was still sitting in the driver's seat. The officer drove his vehicle from the store and stopped it in front of the van in order to prevent the three offenders from leaving the scene. The respondent drove his van into the officer's car ""putting him in fear"". That last conduct was said to constitute the offence charged of assaulting the police officer in the execution of his duty. 
      
       
     13 The respondent, together with the co-offenders in the van, decamped, but shortly afterwards gave himself up to police. 
      
       
     14 A large quantity of the items stolen were recovered. When interviewed, the respondent informed the police he had participated in this activity to obtain money to locate his de facto wife who had been reported missing. The van was unregistered, uninsured and the respondent's licence had also been cancelled. 
      
       
     15 The break enter and steal count to which the respondent pleaded guilty related to the activities at the Rand General Store. The other break and enter offences on the Form 1 related to the other premises in Rand. The offences of receiving were committed in the previous October at Albury. The receiving offences were committed about two months previously at Lavington and Albury. 
      
       
     16 In his remarks, the learned trial judge described the respondent's antecedents as not assisting his case. His Honour was euphemistic. 
      
       
     17 The respondent was born on 27 February 1968 and it appears has spent all but a year or two of his life since he was 16 years of age in custody. He came forward for sentence aged 33. He has an appalling record for a variety of offences including numerous break enter and steal offences and offences involving dishonesty. He has frequently committed driving offences. A sentence had been imposed upon him for a number of offences, including one of aggravated break enter and steal in the District Court on 13 February 1998 of imprisonment for six years with a two year non-parole period. He had apparently been released from custody on or about 2 February 2000 and was on parole during the commission of various offences in the year 2000 including those dealt with by his Honour. As a consequence he had been returned to custody in the circumstances I will refer to later. 
      
       
     18 The learned trial judge noted that the respondent had been in custody for most of the period since his arrest and was informed by the prosecutor that custody was relevant to those matters so sentence was dated from 2 November 2000, the day of arrest. 
      
       
     19 The trial judge made a number of findings in the respondent's favour. He described those as including ""quite compelling subjective circumstances"". He found that the respondent had a very disadvantaged upbringing, he having been subjected to violence and sexual abuse. He said:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""His father was Aboriginal and it is plain that many of the circumstances identified by Mr. Justice Wood in  
         Fernando 
          are applicable to his situation."" 
         
        
       
     20 He found that in recent years the respondent had become heavily involved with illegal substances, noting that in 1993 according to a psychiatrist, Dr. Thomas Clark, the respondent had had an amazing history of institutionalisation, neglect and abuse but who, despite that, had retained a resilience of character and fortitude, he, up to that time, having not taken to drugs or alcohol and maintaining a healthy body. 
      
       
     21 His Honour noted that since 1993, at least to some extent, that situation had changed. He noted a willingness in the respondent to put aside his drug abuse, to maintain his long-standing de facto relationship and his relationship with the two children, although accepting that there was a difficulty as to the continuance of the de facto relationship. 
      
       
     22 His Honour found that he had, in custody, proved to be a model prisoner, acquiring skills and having been employed on a work release programme by international cable manufacturers. Those employers, in a reference, spoke ""extremely glowingly indeed of his capacity as a worker and as a leader"". His Honour accepted that, following the release to parole in February 2000, the respondent had obtained employment for about six months prior to being retrenched and that the retrenchment caused the shortage of funds, which the respondent claimed led to the crimes for which he stood for sentence. 
      
       
     23 Having regard to the very tragic background of the respondent and the suggestion he has firmly decided to re-order his life, his Honour expressed himself as extending to him a degree of leniency, which his antecedents would perhaps not otherwise justify. 
      
       
     24 I interpolate that it appears that his Honour, at this point, was applying the principles enunciated by Chief Justice King in Osenkowski v. The Queen (1982) 30 SASR 212 at 212-213. That decision, which concerned a Crown appeal against inadequacy of sentence, emphasised that such appellate provisions as are here invoked should not be used unduly to circumscribe the sentencing discretion of judges and that there must always be a place for the exercise of mercy and leniency. That principle has frequently been recognised in the High Court and the Courts of Criminal Appeal of all the States of Australia. 
      
       
     25 Indeed, the High Court in Everett v. The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 295 has emphasised that discretion and more recently in Regina v. Dinsdale (2000) 74 ALJR 1538 and Regina v. Wong & Leung [2001] HCA 64 has underlined the breadth of discretion to be exercised by the trial judge. I shall turn again to those considerations later in this judgment. 
      
       
     26 His Honour then turned to a further matter and, in particular, referred to the sentences passed upon the co-offenders who, at least in respect of the offences charged on indictment and as to some of the offences referred to in the Form 1, were the principals in the first degree. Goodall was noted as having a very significant record of criminal antecedents but having received a sentence of 12 months with a four month non-parole period in the Local Court. The trial judge had sentenced Wolhar, who did not have a criminal record as bad as that of the respondent, but his Honour was of the view that a parity should be preserved between the two. Such a course is explicable by reference to factors his Honour did not expressly note, that is, that the offender was not the creator of the nefarious scheme nor the principal in the first degree as far as the break and enter offences were concerned. 
      
       
     27 His Honour appears to have had regard to what the High Court said concerning parity and inconsistency of sentence between co-offenders in Lowe v. The Queen [1984] 12 A. Crim. R. 408 and applying those principles was of the view that the respondent should receive the same sentence as Mr. Wolhar. There is no information with which we have been provided to suggest that there has been a Crown appeal in the case of Wolhar. 
      
       
     28 The effect of his Honour's sentence was that, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, his Honour sentenced the respondent to imprisonment for a term of three years on the break enter and steal count commencing from 15 May 2001 and expiring on 14 May 2004. A non-parole period of nine months, expiring on 14 February 2002 was provided. But the total head sentence was three years, six months and two weeks. That was in consequence of his Honour making the sentence to which I have referred cumulative upon a sentence of six months and two weeks on the assault police count, that sentence having been expressed to commence on 2 November 2000 and to expire on 15 May 2001. His Honour directed that the respondent be admitted to parole on 14 February 2002 and ordered that his parole be supervised by the Probation and Parole Service, in particular, in respect of treatment for drug abuse. 
      
       
     29 At the conclusion of his remarks on sentence, his Honour asked the Crown whether anything further should be put to him. Nothing was put to suggest that he had fallen into error or that in any way there was any technical problem with his sentence. Before parting with the matter, his Honour informed the respondent that it was his expectation that if the respondent committed further offences, he would go back to serve the balance of his sentence should he be released at the expiration of the non-parole period. 
      
       
     30 However, we are now informed that on 14 August 2001, ie., before this respondent was sentenced, the Parole Board had revoked the parole order relating to the respondent's 1998 sentence and that this matter was not referred to his Honour by the Crown. Indeed the transcript records the Crown Prosecutor's response to his Honour specifically seeking to ascertain the situation. His Honour was informed that the respondent's prior custody was solely related to these offences. His Honour appears to have fixed the sentence and non-parole period commencement dates in reliance on what he was told. It now appears that the respondent had been in custody solely referrable to these matters only from 2 November 2000 to 14 August 2001, although that custody was interrupted by his detention following arrest for other offences to which I will refer later. 
      
       
     31 It is apparent that the revocation of the respondent's parole was in consequence of the commission of the very offences here charged and not for other offences committed after his release. He had been released to parole on 1 February 2000, and returned to custody on 2 May 2000 after having been charged with larceny and take and drive conveyance without consent of owner. He had been also charged on 15 February 2000 with possession of car breaking implements. He was released when he was placed on a bond for these three offences in the Local Court on 10 May 2000. Thus he was on these bonds as well as on parole when the crimes for which he was sentenced were committed. These matters require the sentence to contain a significant deterrent component (Regina v. Readman (1990) 47 A. Crim. R. 181). 
      
       
     32 In consequence of that revocation, however, the respondent is required to serve the balance of parole of two years, five months and 19 days from 14 August 2001 until 1 February 2004 unless re-admitted to parole earlier. In effect, that means that the respondent is liable to serve in custody the entire term of Patten DCJ.'s sentence less some three months. He has lost the benefit of the non-parole period ordered by his Honour and of most of the parole period. This sentence is thus substantially more severe in effect than his Honour intended, as the respondent will not receive the benefit of release to parole his Honour ordered. 
      
       
     33 It is submitted on behalf of the Crown that in those circumstances the impact of double jeopardy might be perhaps less than it might usually be in other cases of Crown appeals. For myself I would not accept that the Crown should be entitled to utilise that circumstance in the way submitted. I do not see that the fact his Honour was not informed of the true position and that the applicant had to serve the balance of the previous sentence would diminish the impact on the offender of the exposure to possible re-sentencing inherent in a Crown appeal. 
      
       
     34 I note that the Crown does not contend that because that parole was revoked the sentences became inadequate because a substantial portion of them will also be served while serving the remainder of the prior sentence in custody. The Crown submits that any sentences for these offences should commence, as the trial judge directed these sentences should commence, on 2 November 2000. Thus, the sentences for these offences in the Crown's submission should be concurrent with the sentences on which parole was revoked. I will return to this matter later also. 
      
       
     35 As to the trial judge's findings concerning the respondent's prior circumstances, the Crown submissions refer explicitly to material contained in the reports of Dr. Clark and Mr. W. John Taylor which had been tendered in evidence and in particular the following submission was made:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""His Honour was provided with report of Dr. Thomas O. Clark (25 March 1993, prepared for then current sentence proceedings) and of Mr. W. John Taylor (26 August 1996, prepared for some pending claim by the respondent for victims compensation). According to those reports, the respondent is the third child in a family of seven children (as he told Mr. W. John Taylor); or fifth of eight (as he told Dr. Thomas O. Clark). His father was aboriginal (Taylor) or half aboriginal (Clark) and his mother white. He grew up in Inverell. His father died when he was about six (Taylor) or about 15 (Clark). The respondent became a state ward at age six or seven (Taylor) or about 15 (Clark). His Honour accepted that the respondent had endured a 'very disadvantaged upbringing which, subjected him to violence and sexual abuse'. 
         
        
        
         
         As to employment, he told Mr. Taylor (in 1996) that he had only had two jobs since leaving school, both for three months or less. They were on a dairy farm and a trout farm. In 1993 he told Dr. Clark he had had a few jobs, and had worked on a trout farm at one time and had worked as a brickie's labourer. 
         
        
        
         
         Dr. Clark's 1993 report relayed from the respondent that he had not indulged in alcohol or drugs 'to a severe degree'. This was confirmed as to alcohol in Mr. Taylor's 1996 report. As to drugs ,Mr. Taylor reported that he had commenced using amphetamines at age 16 or 17; stopped after about a year; then smoked cannabis; then commenced heroin abuse in gaol, but only occasionally. He told Mr. Taylor he had not used any drugs 'for some time'."" 
         
        
       
     36 The Crown attacked the sentences in a number of ways. The Crown relied on the inconsistencies in the histories and that the report material before his Honour, including the Probation & Parole report, were not current as providing no satisfactory explanation for the re-offending and no basis for his Honour's expectations of the offender's prospects of rehabilitation. 
      
       
     37 It was submitted that the sentences imposed by his Honour were manifestly inadequate both individually and in their total effect and particular criticism was made of the shortness of the non-parole period. It was submitted that the sentences failed to reflect the objective gravity of the offences, particularly in the light of the respondent being on parole, in breach of bonds, and with a prior record of like offences. 
      
       
     38 In support of the Crown's submissions, our attention was drawn to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal re Attorney-General's Application No. 1 under s.26 of the Criminal Procedure Act, Regina v. Ponfield (1999) 48 NSWLR 327. In that decision it was held that it was appropriate for the court to formulate a sentencing guideline judgment as appropriate to offences under s.112 of the Crimes Act 1900 by indicating relevant sentencing considerations without establishing a starting point or developing a range. 
      
       
     39 In that matter, Grove, J., with whom the Chief Justice and Sully, J. agreed, noted that he remained unpersuaded of a general pattern of leniency which would attract the issuance of a specific guideline judgment, particularly one prescribing a specific range of sentences as the seriousness of the offences to which s.112 may apply varies almost infinitely from case to case and so do the relevant circumstances to be taken into account. 
      
       
     40 That decision was recently referred to by the High Court in Wong & Leung v. The Queen [2001] HCA 64. As I understand the joint judgment in the High Court, insofar as their Honours did not disapprove entirely of guideline judgments, there was an acceptance that the approach taken in Ponfield (supra) was appropriate. In Ponfield (supra) it was held that the court should regard the seriousness of an offence contrary to s.112 as enhanced and reflect that enhanced seriousness and the quantum of sentence by reference to certain factors relevantly for this case, if, (1) the offence is committed whilst the offender is at conditional liberty, eg., on parole; (2) the offender has a prior record, particularly for like offences. 
      
       
     41 That decision does not, in my view, support the submission that his Honour fell into any particular error. It is plain that his Honour adverted to the matters in the present case to which the relevant criteria in Ponfield (supra) were applicable. 
      
       
     42 The Crown referred to his Honour having failed to indicate the precise extent to which the respondent had benefited from a discounting of his sentence for a plea on the utilitarian basis identified in Regina v. Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. The suggested error of his Honour failing to assign a specific value to the offender's plea is not one of which, in my view, the Crown can be heard to complain. No assistance was given to him at trial in this regard nor is precise specification always essential. 
      
       
     43 It is contended that his Honour fell into error by not identifying with more precision and detail the circumstances identified by Mr. Justice Wood in Regina v. Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim. R. 58 which were said to be applicable to this respondent's situation, although it was conceded that it was open to his Honour to apply the last of the eight propositions stated by Justice Wood in Fernando (supra at 62-63) which emphasised that full weight must be given to the competing public interest in rehabilitation of the offender and the avoidance of recidivism, whilst not losing sight of the objective seriousness of the offence in the midst of what might otherwise be attractive subjective circumstances. However, the Crown submitted that little leniency should have been extended to the respondent by the trial judge to enable rehabilitation or the avoidance of recidivism. 
      
       
     44 That submission emphasises the respondent's past record and the offences committed by him since being released on parole. 
      
       
     45 The Crown contended that his Honour had erred in failing to indicate the precise manner in which he took into account the offences listed on the Form 1 and referred to his Honour's failure to give reasons so as to comply with s.44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Insofar as the sentence on this count is submitted to be manifestly inadequate, considering the total culpability relevant to the offences for which sentence was passed on this court: see Regina v. Morgan (1993) 70 A. Crim. R. 368, I will deal with the submission later. I do not understand the criticism to be that the sentence was in error as failing to include a sufficient and identifiable component for the offences on the Schedule. Further, I understand that the gravamen of the complaint based on s.44 is not the failure to give reasons but the length of the non-parole period which matter, again, I will consider later. Therefore, I do not consider these matters in this particular case would warrant intervention. 
      
       
     46 The Crown submitted that his Honour's failure to make an express finding of special circumstances and to make a record of the reasons for finding special circumstances suggested an error of substance but it was plainly within his Honour's judgment that there were many circumstances which his Honour would have been entitled to regard as ""special"" or as falling within those identified by Wood, J. in Fernando (supra) and that authority does not bind his Honour to express reasons in these regards with that degree of precision. 
      
       
     47 It was submitted that his Honour had erred in sentencing on the basis of any parity with the sentence passed on Wolhar given that Wolhar had pleaded guilty to only one count of break enter and steal (the respondent had pleaded guilty to only one count of break enter and steal). Wolhar had also pleaded guilty to one count of malicious wounding (he stabbed Officer Thomas in his right forearm with a screwdriver) and Wolhar's Form 1 contained six driving offences and three goods in custody offences together with the remaining two counts of break enter and steal. It was particularly put forward that Wolhar was not at the time of the commission of the offences subject to a bond or parole as was the respondent. This is, of course, the major difference between the two situations, although there remains some considerable difference not to the respondent's disadvantage between the roles played by the two. I do not consider that in this respect his Honour erred in such a way as would warrant intervention, having regard to the principles applicable to Crown appeals to which I will turn later in this judgment. 
      
       
     48 In my view, there remains to consider, however, three substantial matters. Firstly, whether the sentence imposed in respect of the offence of assaulting the police officer was itself so inadequate as to show that, in totality, the sentences were manifestly inadequate. Secondly, whether the sentence for the break and enter offences in the circumstances in which they were committed whilst so recently released on parole and on bonds so recently imposed, was similarly inadequate and lastly whether there was error as to the proportion the non-parole period bore to the sentence as a whole, particularly having regard to the respondent's continued offending after being given the opportunity inherent in the lenient sentencing treatment he had so recently been afforded. 
      
       
     49 In Regina v. Pont [2000] NSWCCA 419, I said:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""The notice of appeal asserts as the ground of appeal that the sentence ""is inadequate"". By this ground, I understand that it is intended to assert ""error in point of principle"" (see per Barwick, CJ. in  
         Griffiths v. The Queen 
          (1977) 137 CLR 293 at 310) as would amount to ""the kind of manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing standards"" ( 
         Everett v. The Queen 
          (1994) 181 CLR 295 at 300 and  
         Regina v. Barbara  
          (CCA, unreported 24 February 1997)) as would warrant the exercise of the exceptional power vested in the Director by s.5D by appealing to invoke the court's function to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of sentencing courts in such circumstances as applied in this case ( 
         Griffiths 
          (supra) at 310). That kind of error would be found in the course taken by the primary judge in consequence of such findings of fact as were properly open and made. The appeal does not call for any re-hearing to re-determine findings open on the facts:  
         Histollo Pty. Limited v. Director-General of National Parks & Wildlife Service 
          (CCA, unreported 10 December 1998). The appeal is against the exercise of a discretion which recognises that a range of sentences might be appropriate in any case and that judges might legitimately differ in philosophy, approach and result: see Spigelman, CJ. in  
         Regina v. Jurisic 
          (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 and Kirby, P. in  
         Regina v. Hayes 
          (1987) 29 A. Crim. R. 452.  
         
        
        
         
         I understand the ground to assert not merely that there has been disclosed some error of principle such that the sentencing discretion has been improperly exercised even though that error might not be able to be identified (see  
         Cranssen v. The King  
         (1936) 55 CLR 509 at 519-520), but that the error contended for is such as to show that the sentence in its duration or nature is so far outside the permissible range of the exercise of a proper discretion as to require the intervention by this court, at least in the absence of matters going to the exercise of the court's well known discretion to refrain from intervening (see, eg.,  
         Regina v. Morrow 
          [1999] NSWCCA 64;  
         Regina v. Holder 
          (1983) 3 NSWLR 245 at 225-226; 
          Hayes 
          (supra);  
         Regina v. Allpass  
         (1994) 72 A. Crim. R. 561;  
         Regina v. Haughton 
          [2000] NSWCCA 62;  
         Regina v. Kalache 
          [2000] NSWCCA 2). 
         
        
        
         
         On an appeal such as this, the court, in its discretion, may dismiss the appeal and, if upholding it, would ordinarily impose a sentence which might be at the bottom of the range or less than that which ought to have been imposed at first instance: see  
         Kalache 
          (supra);  
         Regina v. Webster 
          [1999] NSWCCA 313, provided that, having regard to the necessity to denounce the error, the discretion and the other matters to be taken into account on re-sentencing, it might properly do so. 
         
        
        
         
         In considering the exercise of those discretions, it is necessary to have regard to other matters such as the double jeopardy in which the respondent has been placed ( 
         Holder 
          (supra);  
         Regina v. Warfield 
          (1994) 34 NSWLR 2000); any delay in instituting the appeal; the extent to which the sentence imposed below has been served ( 
         Regina v. Morris 
          (CCA, unreported 10 March 1989)); the extent of error detected in the original sentence and whether, if that sentence did not involve full-time custody, a re-sentencing to full-time custody is now appropriate ( 
         Allpass 
          (supra)). 
         
        
        
         
         In  
         Haughton  
         (supra), Barr, J., with whom Fitzgerald, JA. and Abadee, J. agreed, referred to one circumstance which might call for the exercise of the discretion not to intervene:- 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           'When this court hears an appeal by the Crown against what is said to be the severity of sentences, the court is not free to take the course it might if sentencing at first instance. A residual discretion exists which favours the respondent to any such appeal if the sentence is found to be below the range of sentencing discretion, but not so far below it that the court considers that it ought not to interfere.' 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Further to what Barr, J. has noted in  
         Haughton 
          (supra), an occasion for the exercise of discretion in particular arises where error is detected in that a sentence is below the range of a proper sentencing discretion, but where the sentence which might be imposed on appeal, having regard, in particular, to those matters appropriate to be considered by the appellate court and the necessity to denounce error in the original sentence, would involve only a limited increase or limited change in the nature of the sentence but which would have a disproportionately onerous effect in the individual circumstances of the respondent 
         
        
        
         
         Crown appeals exist for the correction of errors having general effects (see  
         Everett 
          (supra) and  
         Griffiths 
          (supra)). It follows, since the imposition of sentence is individual in effect, that the correction of such errors of general significance will have a specific impact on the respondent. Insofar, however, as the error proceeds from a failure in the sentencing process below and because its correction may have an impact, in the circumstances, of a particularly onerous kind, provided that the error may be properly corrected and the original criminal conduct as well as the leniency with which it has been treated properly denounced, then it is open to the court to avoid occasioning, by the re-sentencing process, consequences which in their effect would be unduly onerous. This is since the necessity to re-sentence is due to the judicial error, a failure in the process, rather than to any fault of the respondent and, in particular, so as to avoid that failure producing untoward hardship."" 
         
        
       
     50 As to asserted error of manifest inadequacy, in Wong & Leung (supra), Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne, JJ. said, at paras.57-58:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""The actual sentence which a court imposed on an offender reveals very little about the reasons which the court had for fixing that sentence. Contrary to submissions made on behalf of the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth (intervening in support of the respondent) the sentence itself gives rise to no binding precedent. What may give rise to precedent is a statement of principles which affect how the sentencing discretion should be exercised, either generally or in particular kinds of case. It is, therefore, fundamentally wrong to speak of 'quantitative aspects' of discretionary decisions. 
         
        
        
         
         So much is, or should be seen as, no more than a statement of elementary principle. If, however, further elucidation of the principle is necessary, it is evident in cases like  
         House v. The King 
          (1936) 55 CLR 499 and the discussion of when an appellate court may conclude that a trial judge's exercise of discretion has miscarried. Reference is made in  
         House 
          to two kinds of error. First, there are cases of specific error of principle. Secondly, there is the residuary category of error which, in the field of sentencing appeals, is usually described as manifest excess or manifest inadequacy. In this second kind of case appellate intervention is not justified simply because the result arrived at below is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases. Intervention is warranted only where the difference is such that, in all the circumstances, the appellate court concludes that there must have been some misapplication of principle, even though where and how is not apparent from the statement of reasons. It follows that for a court to state what should be the range within which some or all future exercises of discretion should fall, must carry with it a set of implicit or explicit assumptions about what is, or should be regarded as, the kind of case which will justify a sentence within the specified range. It is those assumptions that may reflect or embody relevant principles, not the result."" 
         
        
       
     51 Considerations as to Crown appeals have been set forth in such decisions as Regina v. Allpass (1994) 72 A. Crim. R. 561; Osenkowski (supra); Everett (supra) and Regina v. Kalache (Lesley) (2000) 111 A. Crim. R. 152, noting the discretion not to uphold such an appeal notwithstanding that error might be made out: Regina v. Warfield (1994) 34 NSWLR 200 and the recognition of the element of double jeopardy: Allpass (supra) so that, where the difference between the original sentence and that which might be substituted is not great, or where the effect of the substitution considering what has occurred in the meantime, might be to put such matters as rehabilitation at risk the appeal may be dismissed. See Regina v. Moffitt (1990) 20 NSWLR 114. We have also been referred by the respondent to certain of these principles as enunciated in Regina v. Lansdell (Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported 23 May 1996). 
      
       
     52 His Honour, no doubt in consequence of failing to turn his mind expressly to the necessity of identifying and enunciating the special circumstances and his reasons for reducing the non-parole period, imposed a non-parole period which is 36% of the effective total sentence rather than 75%, as s.44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 would require in the absence of special circumstances. It is complained that his Honour imposed a non-parole period of less than half of the statutorily mandated minimum proportion. 
      
       
     53 Although it was contended that there was no evidence before his Honour to justify a finding that the respondent or the community would benefit from a longer period of parole supervision, there was some material before his Honour of the respondent's remorse and his willingness and intention to turn around his life and of other matters which were capable of being held to be special circumstances. I have already noted the Crown's submission as to how this material should be regarded. 
      
       
     54 His counsel had, without objection from the bar table apparently, informed the trial judge of his employment since release on parole and his industriousness. 
      
       
     55 The respondent's account of his actions to the parole officer was set forth in the Probation & Parole report which was before his Honour and gave rise to that officer reaching the following conclusion:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""Mr. Duncombe present as an intense young man that has matured during this sentence, he stated he has 'reached the crossroads in life'. He appears to have adjusted in the latter term of his sentence and become constructive in terms of participating in program/courses for self-development. Mr. Duncombe appears genuinely motivated and has been very co-operative with all staff. He has shown a positive outlook for his future along with his excellent work record, which should go well for future employment. He also realises he needs support to re-establish himself within the community. 
         
        
        
         
         In addition, Mr. Duncombe stated he sees himself as a different person. He is more confident within himself, a confidence he has acquired during this sentence. He further stated he recognises the importance of the continuing support of his family, who seem to have recognised this change, and are willing to assist him in whatever way they can. He is aware of the consequences of even the slightest transgression if he released (sic) on parole and that his past behaviours have been unacceptable. 
         
        
        
         
         This Service has concerns emanating from Mr. Duncombe's past supervision and offence history and lack of drug and alcohol programs. However, during this term of imprisonment Mr. Duncombe appears to have seriously commenced the process of significant personal change and articulated clearly his desire to remain out of gal. 
         
        
        
         
         With some reservation, this Service recommends that Mr. Duncombe be granted parole as a Special Category Parolee – accommodation, employment and associates, and be subject to the following suggested conditions: 1 to 9, 12, 15, 16, 23."" 
         
        
       
     56 Whatever doubt the subsequent events have thrown upon this material, there was in this report and in those of Dr. Clarke and Mr. Taylor some evidence of the respondent's expressed willingness to try to avoid recidivism such as allowed his Honour to find as he did. 
      
       
     57 There is now admitted on the appeal on the question of the exercise of discretion or on re-sentencing, the respondent's affidavit, the statement of his mother-in-law and the report of a psychologist. Those materials go a long way to support the trial judge's findings and to enable this court, were it minded to intervene, to exercise the relevant discretion and, if it were minded to re-sentence, to do so in a way designed to avoid placing impediments in the way of the respondent's rehabilitation and taking up his family responsibilities. The psychologist's report and recommendations are most helpful. 
      
       
     58 In considering whether to intervene and, if so, the extent of intervention, regard must be had to whether the eventual product of sentence would still reflect an acceptable parity with co-accused. See generally Dinsdale (supra at 1538 at para.62). The circumstances of the commission of these offences whilst on parole, on bonds and in the context of the past history of like offences, taken in combination, distinguish the respondent's position from that of the relevant co-accused. 
      
       
     59 The respondent's record is appalling and his offences since leaving gaol and whilst on parole demonstrate a breach of trust and put in doubt the views of the parole officer to which his Honour had regard. But I do not consider his Honour erred on what material was before him in deciding to impose a non-parole period of less than 75% of the total sentence. Except in the respects I have mentioned, that is to say, the particular sentences in respect of the assault police charge and the break and enter charge and the degree of disconformity of the non-parole period to the statutory proportion, I consider there was no error of substance. I do not consider that the technical errors the Crown has asserted the trial judge fell into are such, even if made out, particularly considering how the Crown conducted its case below, to warrant intervention. 
      
       
     60 Accepting his Honour's findings, I am however of the view that the sentence of six months and two weeks for the offence of assaulting Mr. Thomas, particularly involving, as it did, the use of a car in the way in which the respondent used the car, is manifestly inadequate such as to show an otherwise undisclosed error of principle so that the sentence does not reflect the gravity of the crime. That sentence is entirely outside the appropriate range of sentences for that crime. The respondent's role in the commission of the assault on the police officer was more prominent than his role in the break and enter offences. But I also consider that the sentence for the break and enter offence for the same reason is unacceptably inadequate, considering the offence was committed on parole whilst on bonds by an offender with such a record including for like offences recently committed and allowing for the Form 1 offences. It is necessary that the sentence for each crime reflect its criminality in the total sentence: Pearce v. The Queen (1998) 103 A. Crim. R. 372. In my view, both of the sentences are inadequate and the total sentence is inadequate. 
      
       
     61 Taking into account all relevant matters to which I have referred and, notwithstanding the material filed on his behalf on this appeal and the submissions of the respondent, I consider that this court should intervene and re-sentence. In each case I consider that at first instance a substantial sentence of actual imprisonment should have been imposed in excess of that which was imposed. The public are entitled to expect that those who continue to offend, disregarding the opportunities offered by sentencing courts to achieve rehabilitation will receive substantial punishment. His Honour erred in failing to have adequate regard for the sentences to reflect the culpability of the conduct of the respondent. It is only because of the well known restraint in Crown appeals and in deference to the trial judge's intent to assist the prospect of the respondent's avoidance of recidivism that I consider that a sentence as short as that I propose should be imposed. In my view, a sentence no shorter than five years taking into account the matters on the Form 1 on the break enter matters is required and a sentence of 12 months is called for on the assault police count, properly balancing all considerations on re-sentencing. The sentence for the break and enter offence should be cumulative on the sentence for the assault, the sentence for which should commence, however, on the day nominated by his Honour, ie., 2 November 2000. The cumulation is appropriate to produce a total sentence reflective of the total culpability for all the offences (including those on the Form 1): see Regina v. Harris [2001] NSWCCA 322. In consequence, the commencement date of the later sentence will be 2 November 2001 and expire on 11 November 2006. There will thus be an effective head sentence of six years. 
      
       
     62 Having regard to the special circumstances which include the tragic background found by his Honour, the suggestion of the respondent's decision to re-order his life, the necessity for support from the Probation and Parole authorities to avoid recidivism and achieve rehabilitation, the sentences passed on the co-accused the recent estimable work history and the respondent's previous personal circumstances (which I apprehend was what his Honour identified with the matters referred to by Wood, J. in Fernando (supra)), and the material provided to this court in the respondent's affidavit; the affidavit of his solicitor; the statement of his mother-in-law, Mrs. Hegarty; and the most valuable report of Margaret Johnson psychologist, I would, as his Honour did, vary the proportion of non-parole period to the total sentence from that provided by s.44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 but not to the extent his Honour did. I would, however, vary the proportion substantially to the respondent's advantage should he, as the material filed on his behalf on the appeal would suggest will be the position, avoid re-offending. In the circumstances of this case, the appropriate mechanism to achieve such an effect as designed to conform to all relevant requirements would be to make the 12 months sentence for assault a fixed term and to commence a non-parole period of three years with the commencement of the second sentence. Thus, although the non-parole period would be 75% of that second sentence, the proportion of non-parole period to the total sentence would be less. 
      
       
     63 I have concluded, having regard to the principles of restraint involved in Crown appeals, that a non-parole period some what shorter than would otherwise be the case but substantially greater than that his Honour imposed would avoid the upholding of the appeal setting at naught the expectations of his Honour and the hopes engendered by the material filed in this court but, on the other hand, would meet that which is necessary so that the sentence will reflect the objective circumstances and total culpability in the context of the respondent's subjective circumstances. Thus, the sentence I propose would achieve a synthesis of all relevant matters: see the joint judgment in Wong & Leung (supra) in the High Court. In addition, I propose that a copy of Ms. Johnson's report be provided to the Corrective Services Department with a view to that Department and the Probation & Parole Service considering its contents and recommendations. 
      
       
     64 The orders I propose therefore are that the appeal be upheld; the sentence imposed in the District Court be quashed; and the respondent re-sentenced as follows. On the count of assaulting a police officer, to imprisonment for a fixed term of 12 months to commence on 2 November 2000 to expire on 1 November 2001. On the count of break enter and steal, and taking into account the matters on the Form 1, to imprisonment for a term of five years to date from 2 November 2001 and to expire on 1 November 2006, a total sentence of six years imprisonment. On the latter sentence, I would impose a non-parole period of three years to date from 2 November 2001. The respondent would be eligible for release on parole at the end of the non-parole period but that parole should be subject to the supervision of the Probation & Parole Service. I would order that the report of Ms. Johnson be sent to the Department of Corrective Services, as I have proposed. The first possible release date would be 2 November 2004.

    L00001/98 - REGINA v Maddison HALL 
     
      
    Judgment: On redetermination of life sentence 
     
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The applicant, then known as Noel Compton Hall, was found guilty by a jury of murdering Lyn Saunders on 22 December 1987 at Gol Gol in the State of New South Wales. He was sentenced by Enderby J who imposed a life sentence saying: “There are no mitigating circumstances. There could not be any. I sentence you to penal servitude for life.” 
     
      
    2 The applicant has, since incarceration, identified herself as a female and undergone appropriate treatment, which will ultimately reassign her gender. She has changed her name to Maddison Hall. She was born on 4 December 1963 and was, accordingly, aged twenty-four at the time of the offence. 
     
      
    3 The circumstances of the murder reflect a very significant degree of criminality. The applicant and an associate had determined on a criminal enterprise with its aim being the purchase of marijuana in the Mildura area of the State. The associate had previously picked up the victim, who was a hitchhiker and it was intended that the victim would be used because of his contacts, to access drugs. He had apparently been in the course of hitchhiking to Adelaide where his parents lived. As time passed, the victim failed to produce the promised contacts to make the drugs available. The applicant gradually became angry and sarcastic and formed the view that the victim was using them to obtain a free lift on his way to his parents’ home in Adelaide. He then decided to kill the victim who was shot, first in the back and then, the victim having fallen to the ground, he was shot through the mouth, blowing the back of his head away. 
     
      
    4 Enderby J described the events in this manner: 
     
      
       
        
        “So the facts that the jury accepted are that you armed yourself with a deadly weapon, a shot gun which you had cut down and shortened and adapted so that it could be used in a surreptitious way. You and Higgins took off on a criminal venture which had as its aim the purchase of marijuana in the Mildura area of the State. Higgins had earlier by chance picked up the deceased who was a hitchhiker. There was conversation about drugs and him being able to obtain marijuana. Higgins brought him to your place, you took your gun but also arranged for him to be put in funds. 
        
       
       
        
        It can all be summed-up as you sing the services of the deceased so that you could obtain drugs from him from contact that he had in the Mildura area. He was in the course of, at the time, hitchhiking to Adelaide where his parents lived. You could have had no animosity towards him at the beginning of the venture but what seems to have happened as time passed was that he failed to find the drugs which he told you he could find and you became angry with him and sarcastic and thought, rightly or wrongly, that you were being ripped off by him and that he was only using you to obtain a free lift on his way to his parents’ home in Adelaide. That seems to be the most likely explanation for what happened. 
        
       
       
        
        Of course, in normal circumstances, such a state of mind would not be expected to lead to such a terrible crime but in your case it did. On the evidence, the inference is overwhelming that you just decided to kill him. It may be suggested that perhaps your earlier consumption of drugs on the night in question in some way contributed to you forming the intent to kill but nothing has been put to me about that and I could not be satisfied about it. There was evidence that the deceased had taken some drugs and thee was evidence that Higgins had taken some drugs, but there was very little evidence that you had taken any, except much earlier. So at the time in question the evidence is that you were not affected in any way. During the trial you yourself made no claim to have been affected by drugs.” 
        
       
      
    5 Enderby J went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “The opinion I have formed – and I am sure it is the opinion the jury formed – is that you are unhappily the sort of person who, when placed in a situation of that kind, where you believed as I have said, rightly or wrongly, that you were being ripped off, was capable of cold-bloodedly reacting in the way you did. There is no evidence of provocation by the deceased, it was just a simple decision on your part to brutally snuff out the life of a young man.” 
        
       
      
    6 The applicant was sentenced to penal servitude for life and, having regard to the fact that he was already serving a gaol term in relation to a previous offence, his Honour determined that the sentence would date from 1 August 1989, being the date his Honour found the applicant was held in custody in relation to the charge of murder. 
     
      
    7 The applicant now seeks to have that sentence redetermined pursuant to Schedule 1 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The application was originally listed before Barr J at which time the applicant was facing a charge of sexual assault involving another inmate of a correctional institution. 
     
      
    8 The Crown sought that the application be adjourned. This was opposed by the applicant. However, Barr J was persuaded that, unless the charge had been determined, a serious injustice may occur, and he adjourned the matter. 
     
      
    9 The applicant was first received into Long Bay prison, where, for a time, she was held with an A2 classification. Although she received some adverse reports, she generally received positive reviews. She was drug dependent when admitted but underwent a methadone program. With time it would appear the applicant is no longer dependent on drugs, although there is evidence of continued marijuana usage for a greater period of time. However, the applicant presently appears not to be using that substance. 
     
      
    10 The applicant was later transferred to Maitland were she performed well. In 1996, following favourable reports, she was transferred to Junee with a B classification. 
     
      
    11 It appears that it was sometime before 1998 that the applicant first raised with the prison authorities, her claims to be a female. She claimed to be entitled to a transfer to a female gaol and the Serious Offenders Management Committee recommended her transfer to Mulawa which occurred on 14 August 1999. At that prison, problems seemed to have arisen, which included the allegation of sexual assault. As a result of these problems, the applicant was transferred and has since been held in the Acute Crisis Management Unit at Bathurst Correctional Centre since February 2001 under the status of a female. She has received excellent reports from that centre. 
     
      
    12 The sexual assault matters did not ultimately proceed. The complainant was released from prison and, I understand, travelled to New Zealand. There being no evidence, the matters were “no billed.” The charges are not relevant to the decision which I must make. 
     
      
    13 The Department of Corrective Services, having concerns in the matter, carried out an investigation. Superintendent Lee Downes provided a report, as a result of which Acting Commissioner Woodham, on 9 November 2001, wrote to the Serious Offenders Review Council, asking that the applicant be managed in a male prison and be given a male classification. 
     
      
    14 During the investigation, Superintendent Downes interviewed the applicant. In the course of the interview, the applicant speaks of the difficulties with her sexual identity and her involvement with drug taking within the complex at Junee. It is clear that the applicant has been involved in a number of relationships and has offered sex to inmates in return for drugs within the prison system. 
     
      
    15 She was asked by Superintendent Downes about the circumstances of the murder and responded: 
     
      
       
        
        “At that stage I just denied it to him because I denied it to him before. But I always knew that I had done it and I accepted responsibility for it. I regret it tremendously. I am not saying I would trade places – if I could go back not even with what I know now. I could go back to the day before it happened I’d guarantee it wouldn’t happen. I would have done things differently, I wouldn’t have gone that day, I would have stayed at home, especially because knowing what the outcome of the day was. Regards the fact that I got life that’s got nothing to do with it. I’m just not happy that things got out of control and someone lost their life. As I said I will do whatever time I have to do for whatever I’ve done. I’ve got no issue with that … I regret terribly that he died. He was a nice person. Things just got out of control and he died.” 
        
       
      
    16 The applicant gave evidence before me. She told of her recent work experience in prison and I was shown examples of her craft, using recycled materials. She is also undertaking a course of study in community work and hopes ultimately, to undertake a university course through Charles Sturt University. She told the court of her progress towards gender reassignment, including her understanding that she may have a full reassignment, including surgery, within nine months. 
     
      
    17 The applicant’s use of drugs and problems with her gender status have been examined by the Department of Corrective Services. In a letter to the Serious Offenders Review Council, dated 22 October 2001, Alcohol and Other Drug worker Trezise, reported as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ms Hall is always polite and willing to work whenever we have met for counselling. Also she displays a realistic view of her A & OD and Transgender issues, her incarceration and potential difficulties associated with her possible release from custody. 
        
       
       
        
        Ms Hall has stated on numerous occasions that her substance use was a way of coping with the stress related to her early sexuality conflicts. She feels that as she has now fully accepted herself for who she is there will no longer be any conflict that requires the use of drugs as a way to escape. Ms Hall certainly does appear to have a healthy self esteem in regards to her sexuality and gives every indication that other people’s opinion of her transgender status no longer matters. 
        
       
       
        
        Ms Hall also appears to have overcome her drug use and expresses the view that she no longer needs or desires drugs and has too much to lose by returning to substance use. 
        
       
       
        
        I have discussed at length with Ms Hall the possibility of using substances to cope with difficult situations if she is released from custody and whilst she feels that this will not be the case, she wants to maintain regular contact with the counsellors at the Gender Centre for support.  
        
       
       
        
        In this worker’s professional opinion, Ms Hall has recovered from her past addictions and is looking forward without them, however, she would benefit from ongoing support from the counsellors at the Transgender Centre whilst incarcerated and in the community. Ms Hall appears to have realistic goals and expectations of herself if she is released from custody but will need support with her reintegration back into the community.” 
        
       
      
    18 The applicant has been assessed by Dr William Lucas, a forensic psychiatrist. In a report dated 21 June 2000, he concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ms Hall’s only psychiatric diagnosis is gender identity disorder, trans-sexual type. The diagnosis is recent, in the official sense, but she has given a history of seeing a general practitioner in 1985, this diagnosis being made and apparently some form of treatment instituted. It would be interesting to have corroborating information from this general practitioner or Ms Hall’s relatives, if any at that time knew of her difficulties. 
        
       
       
        
        I do not think there is sufficient information to make a personality diagnosis. Ms Hall has a history suggesting anti-social traits but drug abuse possibly clouds the picture and if sexual identity problems did arise many years ago these two would have to be taken into account. Anti-social personality traits may still be present but they are likely to have moderated over the yeas. Ms Hall’s prison record is generally favourable, as it is most life sentence prisoners who have already served a substantial time. This is to her credit but one must always be cautious in using prison conduct to predict behaviour in the community. A long term prisoner needs to be prepared for release and carefully assessed during this process. 
        
       
       
        
        It should be clear from this report there are some uncertainties about Ms Hall. I would have preferred to have received a more straightforward and detailed account of the offence itself. However, I think the setting of a minimum sentence would assist both Ms Hall and the correctional authorities in planning for her eventual release. Ms Hall’s psychiatric condition, gender identity disorder, is not, as far as I can see, relevant to her crime but is a matter which will have to be dealt with by Ms Hall and the authorities during the remainder of her sentence. It will be a factor in the preparation for her release and how she is supervised in the community. The question of further medical treatment and other assistance is primarily the responsibility of her medical advisers. 
        
       
       
        
        The question of the possibility of a further serious offence will be of concern to the court, especially in the light of Justice Enderby’s sentencing remarks. From the psychiatric point of view, Ms Hall’s diagnosis does not provide information relevant to future violent conduct other than it could be said that the successful adoption of female identity and the continuation of treatment with hormones may well reduce her aggressiveness. The offence occurred when she was involved in drug use and dealing so it is essential that Ms hall is not in any way involved in drugs on release and receives counselling and supervision. If problems arise with her psychiatric treatment or she reverts to drug use problems with behaviour could well arise.” 
        
       
      
    19 Dr Lucas saw the applicant again in November 2001. On this occasion he concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ms Hall’s psychiatric diagnosis remains gender identity disorder, trans-sexual type. Reference should be had to the psychiatric report of 8 September 1999 prepared by Dr Louise Newman which discussed diagnostic issues. Dr Newman excludes additional diagnoses such as psychosis or mood disorder. A similar assessment was made by Dr Parmegiani who saw Ms Hall in Junee during 1998. 
        
       
       
        
        My assessment of Ms Hall is consistent with those of Dr Newman and Dr Parmegiani. 
        
       
       
        
        My reassessment of Ms Hall indicates that she is now more settled in prison, although not in an institution for female inmates, and that her mental state is stable. She had no complaints indicating depression and she has been free of thoughts of self-harm and has not attempted to injure herself at Bathurst Correctional Centre. It should be noted that when I first saw her she had been in Mulawa for six weeks. It remains a good question as to how well Ms Hall and that institution had been prepared for her arrival. From November that year she was in a number of other prisons, segregated from male inmates and in a situation of personal and legal uncertainty. It seems she has responded to a more stable placement and an opportunity to work, study and form relationships with staff. 
        
       
       
        
        Ms Hall has sensible and realistic plans for her future. She intends to pursue studies while still in prison and has ideas about how she might resettle in the community following her release. 
        
       
       
        
        Her remaining years in prison may not be without difficulty in relation to classification, but I believe that both she and the Department of Corrective Services will be assisted by the setting of a minimum sentence so that appropriate planning can be undertaken. There are a number of possible classifications available once her sentence is determined: she could remain in Bathurst, be transferred to Emu Plains or, perhaps less appropriately, be returned to Mulawa. As far as I know the management of her gender disorder has been satisfactory and professional support is available for future treatment. 
        
       
       
        
        At the time of the killing which led to her conviction for murder, Ms Hall was involved in drug abuse. There were indications of antisocial traits, as described in my previous reports, but these are likely to have modified over the years. If Ms Hall’s gender disorder is well managed and she is able to resettle satisfactorily in the community, and avoid drug abuse, then the chances that she will reoffend in a serious fashion will be substantially reduced. She does not require treatment for a major psychiatric disorder but if needed psychiatric assessment and support can be provided during the remainder of her sentence and when she returns to the community. 
        
       
      
    20 Ms Kylie Lander, a clinical psychologist, assessed the applicant when she was in the Junee Correctional Centre. In her report, dated 16 May 1997, she summarised her findings as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Hall was compliant and communicative during the assessment process. He appears to accept full responsibility for his crime and discussed his regret for having committed the act. Mr Hall stated that he now has an extremely high frustration tolerance level and described the interventions he uses to manage stressful or potentially volatile situations. These interventions demonstrate that Mr Hall not only has the capacity to regulate his behaviour and enact non-violent coping strategies, but that he is able to plan ahead and engage in decisional balancing. 
        
       
       
        
        With regard to the results of the MMPI-2, it would appear that Mr Hall has in the past had difficulties with authority figures. Mr Hall acknowledges this, but accounts from both Mr Hall and Correctional Staff indicate that this is not currently a problem. Mr Hall also acknowledges social non-conformity as an issue for him, but the manner in which Mr Hall exhibits his social non-conformity, namely his feminine appearance, is not pertinent to his capacity to handle aggression 
        
       
       
        
        It is the author’s opinion that Mr Hall does possess a number of strategies for dealing with stress and anger. His specific coping skills, in addition to his global coping skills appear to have been effective. Mr Hall has no internal charges of a violent nature on record.” 
        
       
      
    21 Evidence was tendered of the applicant’s criminal history before the offence of murder. The record contains convictions for drug offences and a number of offences for dishonesty. I have no doubt that drugs played a significant part in all those matters. The applicant was taking drugs at about the time of the murder, although I have already related Enderby J’s comments in that regard. 
     
      
    22 I am required, by clause 3 of Schedule 1, when redetermining the applicant’s sentence to have regard to: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1)(a) all of the circumstances surrounding the offence for which the sentence was imposed, and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) all offences, wherever and whenever committed, of which the offender has been convicted …” 
        
       
      
    23 I must also have regard to the matters identified in clause 7 of the Schedule, being: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) any reports on the offender made by the Review Council, and any other relevant reports prepared after the offender was sentenced, that are available to the Supreme Court, and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the need to preserve the safety of the community, and 
        
       
       
        
        (c ) the age of the offender (at the time the offender committed the offence and also at the time the Supreme Court deals with the application), and 
        
       
       
        
        (d) in the case of an offender sentenced before 12 January 1990 … the fact that the sentencing court: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) would have been aware that an offender sentenced to imprisonment for life was eligible to be released on licence under section 463 of the Crimes Act 1900, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) would have been aware of the practice relating to the issue of such licences, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (e) any other relevant matter.” 
        
       
      
    24 I am also required to have regard to the matters provided by subcl 3 of clause 7, but it is not necessary for me to relate them. 
     
      
    25 I have, when considering this application, had regard to the various reports of the Serious Offenders Review Council to this Court. I have identified in these reasons some matters of particular relevance from those reports, but I indicate that I have had regard to the whole of the material contained within them. 
     
      
    26 It is submitted by the Crown that, although there may be significant factors favouring a redetermination of the applicant’s sentence, there are other matters mitigating against that course. The submission that the Crown makes is that I should not proceed to redetermine the applicant’s sentence, but indicate that, having regard to a number of matters, that decision should await a further two or three year period. It is submitted that the applicant has lied to the prison authorities about her relationships, claiming a number of de facto partners, has been ambivalent about accepting responsibility for the murder, and has denied having a drug problem. 
     
      
    27 I accept that at times the applicant has not been accurate and may not have been truthful about all of her relationships. She says that this occurred out of a concern for the other person involved and not to assist herself. I accept this explanation as generally correct. In any event, I do not believe these matters would disentitle the applicant to a redetermination of her sentence. 
     
      
    28 With respect to the murder itself, I have referred to the original difficulty the applicant had in this respect but now believe her position has genuinely changed. Drugs remain a significant potential problem, but I am persuaded that the applicant has been, for some time, clean, and maintains a determination to avoid drugs in the future. I do not believe the apparent prostitution of herself in Junee prison, a matter adverted to by the Crown, would disentitle the applicant to have her sentence redetermined. Nor am I of the view that the difficulties which the applicant has experienced in her gender identification, and the fact that her reassignment is not yet complete, are matters which would preclude a redetermination. 
     
      
    29 These matters remain significant problems for the applicant. They will have to be addressed and, ultimately, her capacity to function in the general community will be, in part, dependent upon the success of the gender reassignment. However, those difficulties are difficulties faced by members of the community, no doubt, who have never experienced a custodial sentence, and, accordingly, I do not believe those matters should preclude a redetermination at this time. 
     
      
    30 In my opinion the offence of murder committed by the applicant, involved a high degree of criminality. However, it did not involve criminality of the highest order (for a discussion of these matters see R v Alexander (1999) 107 A Crim R 449). Nevertheless, an apparently innocent person lost his life when the applicant, impatient to achieve her own ends, shot the deceased. The murder was both chilling and cold-blooded. 
     
      
    31 I accept that the applicant has made progress towards her rehabilitation which will be assisted if I now determine a term for her sentence. She is now remorseful and has real insight into her crime. She will obviously have ongoing difficulties, both within prison and perhaps on her subsequent release because, of her gender difficulties. She will need considerable supervision and assistance if she is to be successfully rehabilitated into society. 
     
      
    32 Mindful of these matters, I believe it appropriate for me to set a specified term for the sentence. I also indicate that in my opinion the particular needs of the applicant make plain that, upon her release, she will require considerable supervision and assistance if she is to successfully adapt to her role as a woman in society and remain free of drugs. 
     
      
    33 There has been some consultation as to the operative date for any sentence which I now determine, the applicant being in custody in relation to other matters when charged with the offence of murder. Enderby J determined that, having regard to the circumstances of her imprisonment, the sentence which he imposed should commence on 1 August 1989. 
     
      
    34 However, as the applicant was remanded in custody for the offence, it is that date which operates for the purposes of cl 5(1) of the Schedule. Like Enderby J, I am of the view that that date is also 1 August 1989, for, until that date, the applicant was in custody in relation to the other matters. 
     
      
    35 Mindful of all the evidence before me, the applicant’s age, the offence of murder for which she was sentenced by Enderby J, and her other offences, and having regard to the matters in cl 7 of the Schedule, in particular the reports of the Review Council and the need to preserve the safety of the community, I am satisfied that it is appropriate to resentence the applicant to a term of twenty-two years imprisonment commencing on 1 August 1989 and expiring on 31 July 2011. I set a non-parole period of sixteen years and six months so that the first date on which the applicant will be eligible for release is 28 February 2006.

      REGINA v RICHARD JOHN DONEY 
     The Minister referred the matter to the Court after a long series of trials and appeals involving the appellant, who was convicted of importing a large quantity of cannabis resin. A Crown witness gave evidence at the trial that the appellant had recruited him to assist in the importation operation. A handwriting expert gave evidence (after comparing specimens) that a document containing instructions and found on the witness’s premises was written in the appellant’s handwriting. The appellant effectively denied the incriminating evidence in an unsworn statement.On appeal the appellant sought to lead fresh evidence of a handwriting expert which suggested that the questioned document was not written by the appellant. The primary issue that the Court was required to consider was whether in view of the fresh evidence, there was a significant possibility that, had it been before the jury, the jury would have had a reasonable doubt that the appellant was the author of the document. HELD, allowing the appeal:1. The “whole case” rule as expressed in Ratten v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 510 and Mickelberg v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 259 did not apply in this case as the parties had agreed that the Court was required to pass judgment upon the agreed issues.2. Where the appellant leads fresh evidence the Crown is entitled to adduce evidence which tends to contradict or weaken the fresh evidence.3. When a jury is required to consider issues of disputed handwriting they may be told that they are entitled to make a comparison between handwriting that is disputed and admitted, although they should be told to pay particular attention and regard to expert testimony on the issue: R v Leroy [1984] 2 NSWLR 441.4. The evidence of the appellant’s expert witness as a whole was not entirely discredited despite omissions and errors established on cross-examination, weak explanations for such errors and the witness’s tendency to argumentativeness and advocacy. The witness’s ability to demonstrate that many features of the writing in the questioned document were different to the handwriting on the specimen documents afforded some cogency and probative value to his opinions and this together with his great experience, the conviction with which he held his opinions and the common sense element in his approach meant that a jury would not disregard the effect of his testimony and could give rise to some doubt on the part of the jury as to the authorship of the document in question.5. There was a significant possibility that a jury would have a reasonable doubt that the appellant was the author of the questioned document and the appellant is entitled to a fresh trial.6. The interests of justice are best served by ordering a verdict of acquittal be entered rather than a new trial in circumstances such as these where the appellant has served the original sentence and where the long history of litigation means there would be little point in a new trial. 
      
       
      ORDERS: 
       
      (1) Appeal upheld. 
       
      (2) Conviction quashed. 
       
      (3) Verdict of acquittal be entered.

      REGINA v RICHARD JOHN DONEY 
       
       
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 IPP AJA:  
      
       
        
       The reference to this Court 
        
       
     2 This matter comes before the Court as a reference by the Minister of Justice, acting on behalf of the Attorney General, under s 474C(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900. 
      
       
     3 The reference by the Minister follows a long series of trials and appeals involving the appellant.  
      
       
     4 On 25 September 1987 the appellant was convicted of being knowingly concerned in the importation into Australia of 2,185 kilograms of cannabis resin, a prohibited import. On 21 October 1988 this Court quashed the conviction and ordered a re-trial (see Doney (1988) 37 A Crim R 288). The conviction was set aside by reason of an erroneous direction to the jury by the trial judge. 
      
       
     5 On 9 August 1989, following a re-trial, the appellant was convicted of being knowingly concerned in the importation of a prohibited import contrary to s 233B(1)(d) of the Customs Act 1901. He was sentenced to sixteen years imprisonment with a nine year non-parole period dating from 9 August 1989. His non-parole period expired with remissions on 4 April 1995 and his head sentence expired with remissions on 26 August 1999. He has served his sentence. 
      
       
     6 The appellant appealed against the conviction of 9 August 1989. On 2 May 1990 this Court dismissed his appeal against the conviction. Subsequently the appellant’s appeal to the High Court was dismissed (see Doney v The Queen (1990) 171 CLR 207).  
      
       
        
       Background circumstances and the agreed issues 
        
       
     7 A series of directions hearings took place prior to the hearing of the present appeal. Through the co-operation of the parties the issues were substantially limited. In order that the agreed issues can properly be understood it is necessary to set out certain background matters, including a brief summary of the evidence that led to the appellant’s conviction on 9 August 1989.  
      
       
     8 On 14 February 1984 a container was unloaded from a container vessel at Port Botany. Two thousand kilograms of cannabis resin were secreted inside some bolts of cotton cloth packed in cardboard cartons. That day, customs agents, Ratcliffe & Polly Pty Limited, received a cargo arrival notice. According to the notice the container had been forwarded to Australia via Singapore from Karachi. The addressee was Smouha Fabrics Pty Limited, C/- Ratcliffe & Polly. 
      
       
     9 On 21 February 1984 Gerard Clayton Freeman presented shipping documents to the agents and used them to clear the container through customs. On 27 February 1984 the container was collected on behalf of the agents and taken to their storage yard. 
      
       
     10 On 1 March 1984 Freeman arrived at the yard where he met another man who had driven there in a truck. A large number of cartons were loaded on the truck. Freeman and the truck then left the yard. The police followed the truck to premises at 40 Grosvenor Crescent, Summer Hill where the truck was unloaded and some of the cartons placed in a garage. The truck was then driven to other premises, other cartons were off-loaded and also placed in a garage. 
      
       
     11 On 6 March 1984 a taxi driver, one Bowman, in answer to a radio call, went to 13 Sloane Street, Summer Hill where he met a man who handed him an envelope (which became Exhibit Q at the trial). The following was written in Roman capitals on the envelope: 
      
       
        
         
         “Garage/From 40 Grosvenor Summer Hill to cnr Darling and Curtis Sts, Balmain. White Ford Panel Van. If unattended leave boxes in van. Thanks.” 
         
        
       
       
       The envelope contained an aerogram on which was written: 
        
        
         
         “$20 taxi thank you”. 
         
        
        
       The aerogram became Exhibit R at the trial. 
        
       
     12 Bowman drove to 40 Grosvenor Crescent and while removing boxes from the garage was approached by police. 
      
       
     13 On 13 March 1984 police executed a search warrant on Freeman’s premises where a piece of paper was located bearing the following notation: 
      
       
        
         
         “Shpr-Zudick International 109 Azam chambers, Mecold Road, Karachi. C-nee – Smouha Fabrics Pty Limited Cooper Lane Surry Hills 2010 NSW” 
         
        
       
       
       This paper became Exhibit M at the trial. It was also known as the “Zudick document”. 
        
       
     14 On 13 March 1984 the police spoke to the appellant who denied any knowledge of the Zudick document or the container.  
      
       
     15 At the trial, Freeman testified that the appellant had recruited him to assist in the clearance of the container. The effect of Freeman’s testimony was that the appellant had been the principal party in the importation of the cannabis resin. 
      
       
     16 A handwriting expert, Mr Anderson, testified on behalf of the prosecution to the effect that the Zudick document found in Freeman’s premises (Exhibit M) and the envelope containing the instructions for Bowman (Exhibit Q), were written by the appellant. Mr Anderson came to this conclusion after comparing these documents with specimen handwriting that admittedly was that of the appellant. 
      
       
     17 On 18 March 1985 Freeman pleaded guilty to a charge of being knowingly concerned in the importation of cannabis resin between 1 December 1983 and 1 March 1984. He was sentenced to sixteen years imprisonment with a minimum term of ten years. On 6 December 1985 this sentence was confirmed by the Court of Criminal Appeal. Freeman, accordingly, was serving his sentence at the time he gave evidence in the appellant’s trial. 
      
       
     18 At the trial, the appellant made an unsworn statement. He denied, in effect, the incriminating evidence given by Freeman. He said that in 1982 he had given Freeman the Zudick document, Exhibit M, and that Freeman had kept it to implicate him. He said that the note given to Bowman, Exhibit Q, was not written by him.  
      
       
     19 One of the grounds of appeal in the second appeal to this Court was that Exhibit Q did not amount to corroboration of Freeman’s evidence and the trial judge erred in directing the jury to the contrary. In rejecting this ground Gleeson CJ, with whom Priestley JA and Maxwell J agreed, stated: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is true that Exhibit Q, taken either alone or in conjunction with the evidence of Mr Bowman, (an innocent taxi driver who picked up and delivered some of the imported goods) is not capable of establishing the appellant’s guilt either of the offence charged or of any other offence. It is also true that it does not support the detail of Freeman’s evidence in so far as it relates to the respective roles of the appellant and Freeman in the matter. That, however, does not mean that it does not corroborate his evidence. As was noted earlier, it is consistent with his evidence, and, once it is accepted that the handwriting on the document is that of the appellant, it establishes a connection between the appellant and the imported goods and materially assists a rejection of the proposition that Freeman’s evidence that there was such a connection was completely false.” 
         
        
       
       
       The Court of Criminal Appeal rejected the other grounds including a ground that the jury’s verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory. In essence their reasoning was that what was to be made of the evidence of Freeman was essentially a question for the jury. 
        
       
     20 The High Court, in dismissing the appellant’s appeal, held that the Court of Criminal Appeal was correct in finding that Exhibit Q was capable of constituting corroborative evidence. In relation to Freeman, the High Court commented at 209: 
      
       
        
         
         “Freeman was by no means a perfect witness. Not only was he an accomplice who attracted the usual warning that it would be dangerous to convict on his uncorroborated evidence, but his evidence was, on his own admission, false in a number of respects. He also admitted to having given a false account when first interviewed by investigating police, to having departed in some respects from evidence previously given and to having given evidence designed to conceal past dishonest dealings which had resulted in convictions for offences of dishonesty. It is clear that the trial judge formed an unfavourable view of his truthfulness as a witness.” 
         
        
       
     21 From the foregoing, the importance of the identity of the author of Exhibit Q is manifest. This importance was recognised by the parties in agreeing to the issues with which this Court was to be concerned in this appeal.  
      
       
     22 The agreed issues are in the following terms: 
      
       
       
       “(1) Whether there is a significant possibility that, had it been before the jury, in conjunction with the evidence led at the trial, the fresh evidence would have produced a significant possibility that the verdict would have been one of acquittal. 
        
        
       (2) Whether there has been, by reason of the evidence now brought forward, a miscarriage of justice at the trial. 
        
        
       (3) Whether the fresh evidence relating to the authorship of Exhibit Q in the proceedings is credible and cogent. 
        
        
       (4) Whether in view of the fresh evidence, there is a significant possibility that, had it been before the jury, the jury would have had a reasonable doubt that the Appellant was the author of Exhibit Q. 
        
        
       If the answers to questions 3 and 4 are in the affirmative, questions 1 and 2 also should be answered in the affirmative.” 
        
       
     23 During the course of argument on appeal counsel for both parties accepted that, practically speaking, there was only one issue, namely, Issue No. 4. The other issues are merely ancillary to that issue. 
      
       
        
        
        
        
       The legal principles applicable to an appeal of this kind 
        
       
     24 The reference by the Minister under s 474C(1)(b) was a reference of “the whole case” to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  
      
       
     25 In Ratten v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 510 Barwick CJ (with whom McTiernan, Stephen and Jacobs JJ agreed) at 514 commented as follows in regard to a reference of “the whole case” by the Attorney General of Victoria:  
      
       
        
         
         “As the Full Court was required to treat the reference to it under s 584 as an appeal, it was bound in dealing with it to act upon legal principles appropriate to an appeal. Thus, although all the material supporting the applicant’s petition formed part of the whole case to be considered by the Court, the ordinary principles as to admissibility of evidence must be applied in the consideration of that material …”  
         
        
       
     26 In Mickelberg v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 259 (at 311 to 312) it was said by Toohey and Gaudron JJ (with whom Mason CJ and Brennan J agreed) that, when a case is referred under s 21(A) of the Criminal Code (WA) (the Western Australian equivalent of s 454C(1)(b) of the Crimes Act), ordinarily it is the duty of the Court of Criminal Appeal to pronounce upon the whole case as presented and the whole case “must be passed upon by the application of legal principles appropriate to criminal appeals”. 
      
       
     27 In the present case, however, the parties have agreed that, in effect, this Court is required to pass judgment only upon the issues as agreed. That agreement which, as I have said, was sensibly arrived at by the parties, takes the matter out of the ordinary “whole case” rule as expressed in Ratten v The Queen and Mickelberg v The Queen. 
      
       
     28 Ordinarily, in a case of this kind, there is a contest as to whether the new evidence to be led is “fresh”. In the present case the parties agreed that the evidence to be led was fresh and no issue arose in this respect. 
      
       
     29 In Ratten v The Queen Barwick CJ said that the use that may be made of fresh evidence differed, depending upon whether the appellant claims a verdict of acquittal as of right, or seeks merely the ordering of a new trial. Where the Court concludes that, as the result of fresh evidence, it has a reasonable doubt as to guilt, the appellant is entitled to an acquittal as of right: R v Pedrana [2001] NSWCCA 66. The appellant did not, in these proceedings, contend that the fresh evidence entitled him to an acquittal as of right. 
      
       
     30 The appellant, rather, sought to bring himself within the second situation referred to by Barwick CJ in Ratten v The Queen, namely, where an appellant does not submit that the verdict should be quashed without more, but contends that he or she is entitled to a new trial by reason of the fresh evidence and argues that, as a matter of discretion, a verdict of acquittal should be entered. In regard to that situation Barwick CJ (at 519) said 
      
       
        
         
         “[T]he court must as before deciding the credibility and the cogency of the fresh evidence in order to determine whether, when the fresh evidence, if believed by the jury, is taken with the evidence given at the trial in that sense most favourable to the accused which reasonable men might properly accept, it is likely that a verdict of guilty would not have been returned. In considering the material before it for this purpose, the element of credibility will be satisfied if the court is of opinion that the evidence is capable of belief and likely to be believed by a jury. The court in this instance will not be directly acting upon its own view of the evidence but rather upon that view most favourable to an appellant, which in the court’s view a jury of reasonable men may properly take. … In the situation with which I am presently dealing, namely of fresh evidence not claimed to establish innocence but to be of such credibility and cogency as to be likely to influence a jury away from a verdict of guilty, it is what a reasonable jury might reasonably make of this evidence which is the dominant consideration”. 
         
        
       
     31 In Mickelberg v The Queen at 273 Mason CJ said the following concerning the second situation referred to by Barwick CJ in Ratten v The Queen: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is established that the proper question is whether the court considers that there is a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellant had the fresh evidence been before it at the trial. This test was endorsed by four of the five Justices in  
         Gallagher v The Queen 
          [(1986) 160 CLR 392]. Deane J and I [at 402] considered that the test was best expressed in those terms.” 
         
        
       
     32 In the circumstances of this appeal it is the test so expressed by Mason CJ that has to be applied. 
      
       
     33 Should this Court, after applying that test, come to the conclusion that the appellant is entitled to a new trial, it will then be required to address the discretionary question whether an acquittal should be ordered. As I observed in R v Pedrana: 
      
       
        
         
         “This would depend on whether any circumstances exist that might render it unjust to the appellant to make him or her stand trial again (remembering, however, that the public interest in the proper administration of justice must be considered as well as the interests of the individual accused):  
         King v The Queen 
          at 427 and 433;  
         Director of Public Prosecutions (Nauru) v Fowler 
          (1984) 154 CLR 627 at 630. Should the interests of justice require than an appellant not stand trial again, the Court, as a matter of discretion, will enter a verdict of acquittal:  
         Spies v The Queen 
          (2000) 74 ALJR 1263 at 1283.” 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       The objection to the evidence of Messrs Westwood and Holland 
        
       
     34 The fresh evidence that the appellant sought to lead was that of John Alexander West, a handwriting expert. The Crown sought to rely on the evidence of two other handwriting experts, Paul Denison Westwood and Neil William Holland, to rebut the evidence of Mr West. Mr Neil SC, senior counsel for the appellant, objected to the respondent leading this evidence in rebuttal.  
      
       
     35 The Court dismissed the objection and indicated that it would give reasons for its decision when delivering its reasons in regard to the appeal itself. I proceed now to set out my reasons for joining in that decision. 
      
       
     36 In Ratten v The Queen the High Court approved the procedure that had been followed by the Victorian Full Court in hearing the appeal in that case. That procedure is apparent from the following remarks of Barwick CJ at 520: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Full Court received oral evidence both from the appellant and from the Crown: it allowed cross-examination of the witnesses produced by the appellant and the Crown. The Court’s course in doing so, was challenged by the appellant. But in my opinion the Full Court was not in error in the course it took. In the first place the Full Court was entitled and indeed bound to satisfy itself whether, upon all the material available to it, there was such doubt as to the guilt of the applicant as would make the maintenance of the jury’s verdict a miscarriage of justice. In the second place, in the alternative situation in which a new trial was sought, the court had to satisfy itself as to the credibility and cogency of the fresh evidence in order to decide whether, if it were believed, it was likely to bring about a different verdict”. 
         
        
       
     37 The same issue was raised in Mickelberg v The Queen (unreported, CCA Supreme Court of Western Australia, 12 February 1999) where the Court (Malcolm CJ, Ipp and Wheeler JJ) said: 
      
       
        
         
         “When additional evidence is adduced on behalf of an appellant, the Court will be entitled to receive other evidence which ‘tends to support, contradict or weaken the new evidence or the inferences which might be drawn therefrom” ( 
         Ratten v The Queen 
          at 518 per Barwick CJ). To the extent that the other evidence bears directly upon the additional evidence adduced by an appellant, in the sense of contradicting or explaining it, it will be admissible as it would assist in assessing ‘the cogency’ of that evidence”. 
         
        
       
     38 The evidence of Mr Westwood and Mr Holland tended to contradict or weaken the fresh evidence of Mr West. On that basis, I concluded that the respondent was entitled to adduce it.  
      
       
        
       The nature of the contest arising from the fresh evidence 
        
       
     39 In answering the question raised by this appeal (namely, whether there is a significant possibility that, had the fresh evidence been before the jury, the jury would have had a reasonable doubt that the appellant was the author of Exhibit Q) it is not to the point that this Court might prefer the evidence of Mr Westwood and Mr Holland to that of Mr West, or might consider that a reasonable jury would come to the same conclusion.  
      
       
     40 Mr West expressed the adamant and unequivocal opinion that the appellant was not the author of Exhibit Q. Therefore, unless this Court considers that Mr West’s testimony would be rejected by a reasonable jury, there would have to be a significant possibility that such a jury would have a reasonable doubt as to whether the appellant was the author of Exhibit Q.  
      
       
     41 Practically, therefore, it seems to me, this appeal depends on whether, in the light of all the fresh evidence and the other relevant evidence, this Court considers that the expert testimony of Mr West would be regarded by a reasonable jury as having been discredited.  
      
       
        
       The qualifications of the respective experts and some general comments as to their testimony 
        
       
     42 The qualifications of Mr West are impressive. He has been involved in document examination since 1963 when he became a document examiner with the New Zealand police. He studied for a number of years in New Zealand and also in Washington, D.C. under the guidance of the chief document examiner for the United States Treasury. Eventually he became chief document examiner for the New Zealand Police and held this position for twenty years. He supervised a staff of five. He retired from the New Zealand Police in 1983 but was retained on a part-time basis to tutor staff and supervise examinations. He continued in this position while being retained by private persons until 1998.  
      
       
     43 The qualifications of the respondent’s experts, Messrs Westwood and Holland, were no less impressive.  
      
       
     44 Mr Westwood commenced the study of forensic document examination in 1968 and has been testifying as an expert in this field since 1972. He was attached to the document examination bureau of the Federal Police from 1969 to 1983. He resigned from the Federal Police after having served as officer-in-charge of the document examination bureau for approximately ten years. He was then appointed as the director of the document fraud section of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. He resigned from this position on 1 July 1987 to take up full-time private practice.  
      
       
     45 Mr Holland first became involved in the study of documents prior to 1976 and from 1976 to 1989 was employed in the document examination branch of the Victoria Police State Forensic Science Laboratory. He was appointed branch manager at the end of 1980. Since 1 July 1989 he has practised as a consultant and his experience is vast. 
      
       
     46 None of these three witnesses testified at the trial. Mr Anderson, who gave evidence on behalf of the prosecution, was the sole expert witness at the trial. Certain aspects of Mr Anderson’s testimony were criticised by all three of the new expert witnesses and he was not called to testify at the appeal. Mr Bellew, who appeared on behalf of the Crown in the appeal, did not seek support from Mr Anderson’s evidence. Mr Neil criticised the testimony of Mr Anderson and submitted that the jury may well have been confused by the manner in which it was presented. In the result, it seems to me, Mr Anderson’s testimony is not a factor of significance in determining this appeal. 
      
       
     47 Both Mr Westwood and Mr Holland were impressive witnesses. Neither Mr Westwood nor Mr Holland was seriously shaken in cross-examination. Their evidence was cogent, lucidly given and persuasive. It does not necessarily follow from these findings, however, that the appeal fails. Depending on the quality of the testimony of Mr West, and the other relevant evidence, the Court may still come to the conclusion that there is a significant possibility that, in the light of the fresh evidence, a jury would have had a reasonable doubt that the appellant was the author of Exhibit Q. 
      
       
     48 In these circumstances, there is little point in burdening these reasons with a close examination of the fine detail of the testimony of Mr Westwood and Mr Holland. In the end, what is in issue, is the cogency and probative value of the evidence given by Mr West. 
      
       
     49 There is one further general comment that I should make concerning the evidence of the prosecution experts and that given by Mr West. Mr Westwood and Mr Holland employed a number of scientific techniques in facilitating their study of the documents that were put before them. These included photography, enlargement, the use of a stereo microscope and a drawing tube, all of these techniques being applied to the original documents. Mr West, on the other hand, had limited access to the original documents. The reason for this limited access was not explored in evidence. Also, Mr West did not employ the same technical methods of examination. He relied largely on examination by his naked eye and by a magnifying glass. 
      
       
     50 The difference in techniques underlay the different approaches adopted by the witnesses concerned. Mr Westwood and Mr Holland were at pains to ascertain what they termed the “structure” of the handwriting on Exhibit Q and the specimen documents.  
      
       
     51 By the “structure” of the handwriting is meant the particular way in which each relevant letter was constructed. That is, at what point the pen was first applied to the paper to commence the formation of a particular letter, the direction in which the pen proceeded, with what pressure it was applied, when it was next removed from the paper, when it was reapplied and so on. The concept also includes the particular idiosyncratic forms found in particular letters, such as curls, hooks, loops and so forth. Mr Westwood and Mr Holland paid meticulous attention to these matters. 
      
       
     52 Mr Westwood and Mr Holland did not attach particular importance to the overall shape of the letters and their general appearance. That is to say, they did not attribute particular significance to the general similarity or differences between the handwriting in Exhibit O and the specimen documents. They regarded the comparison between the structure of the letters in Exhibit Q and the structure of like letters that appeared in the specimen documents, as being of paramount importance.  
      
       
     53 Mr West, on the other hand, was adamant that general appearance and general similarities and differences in the writing on one document, when compared to the writing on another document, were highly significant. His attitude was that the most important aspect of the writing on Exhibit Q, when compared to the specimen documents, was a simple one, namely, that the writing on Exhibit Q looked different. On more than one occasion Mr West said that the writing was so different that a layman could see that the author of Exhibit Q was not the author of the specimen documents. He invited the Court to look for itself at the writing. For myself, I could not but agree that the writing on Exhibit Q looked different, in a general way, from the specimen writing. 
      
       
     54 On this basis, Mr West said that he did not need techniques such as high quality photography, enlargement, microscopic examination and drawing tubes to inform him sufficiently to enable him to form a reliable opinion. He said that there was a disadvantage in looking at enlargements. He asserted that in doing so one could lose sight of the “whole picture”. He said that the “whole picture” was of overriding significance. While he conceded that the structure of the writing was relevant, he did not appear to attach much importance to it.  
      
       
     55 I think it fair to say that the methods of Mr Westwood and Mr Holland appeared to be more scientific than those of Mr West. They utilised technology effectively to analyse and break down the writing and their opinions were supported by a close examination of the formation of each relevant letter. Mr West’s methods were far more intuitive. He relied on visual examination and experience. 
      
       
     56 Mr Westwood and Mr Holland did not approve of Mr West’s methods, and Mr West was cross-examined extensively by Mr Bellew in this regard. Indeed, the cross-examination of Mr West, generally, was careful, searching and effective.  
      
       
     57 The cross-examination revealed several errors in Mr West’s testimony as given in chief. He was shown to have missed a number of letters in the specimen documents that were inconsistent with some of his assumptions and other errors were revealed. These matters detracted from the force of his views. 
      
       
     58 Mr West also displayed tendencies to be argumentative and at times seemed to adopt the role of advocate. Nevertheless, he was a patently honest witness who frequently made concessions when they were called for. He undoubtedly firmly believed in the rightness of his views. Despite the exposure of several errors of detail, he remained unshaken in his conclusions.  
      
       
        
        
        
        
        
       The task of the jury in regard to issues of disputed handwriting 
        
       
     59 In the light of Mr West’s repeated invitations to the Court itself, to compare, the handwriting on the different documents, the question arises as to the directions that would be given to a jury on this issue.  
      
       
     60 In R v Leroy [1984] 2 NSWLR 441 Street CJ said at 446: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is to be observed that his Honour specifically cautioned the jury to be guided by the handwriting expert. At the same time there was admissible evidence from Deborah Sheil that the writing on the application form appeared similar to that of the appellant, and it was open to the jury under the  
         Evidence Act 
          1898 to make the comparison itself, and to reach a conclusion on the matter. The jury had additional material beyond that available to the handwriting expert, providing a context in which apparent similarities might well have been regarded by the jury as sufficient to support a conclusion that the appellant was the author of the post office box application. I can myself find no error in the manner in which his Honour left the matter to the jury”. 
         
        
       
     61 Thus, according to R v Leroy, a jury may be told that they are themselves entitled to make a comparison between handwriting that is disputed and admitted, although they should be told to pay particular attention and regard to expert testimony on the issue.  
      
       
     62 In Grayden v The Queen [1989] WAR 208 Malcolm CJ adopted this approach and remarked at 213-14: 
      
       
        
         
         “The position in Australia appears to be that the trial judge can give a warning to the jury in respect of the process of comparing handwriting, where documents are left with them in the absence of expert testimony, unless the circumstances require it, but such a warning is not mandatory. The trial judge should, however, make it clear to the jury that the determination of the question of authorship is solely a matter for them:  
         R v Leroy 
          [1984] 2 NSWLR 441 at 446 and  
         Daley v The Queen 
          [1979] Tas SR 75 at 82-83”. 
         
        
        
       See also  
       Medina v The 
         
       Queen 
        [1990] 3 WAR 21. 
        
       
     63 These authorities all stem from and are based on the High Court authority of Adami v The Queen (1959) 108 CLR 605.  
      
       
     64 In my view there is nothing in the Evidence Act 1995 that alters the approach expressed above. [In the light of] Mr West’s frequent requests that the Court look itself at the documents makes the present an a fortiori case of the jury being entitled to take into account their own impressions of the handwriting. 
      
       
        
       The detail of Mr West’s testimony 
        
       
     65 I shall refer to some of the detail of Mr West’s testimony.  
      
       
     66 Mr West focussed on the letter A as it was written on Exhibit Q. He said that in some of these A’s there was a particular kind of loop that distinguished it from the letter A in other documents. He said that this was a significant factor because an A so formed consistently appeared in Exhibit Q.  
      
       
     67 In cross-examination, however, Mr West was shown several A’s in a number of the specimen documents that contained a loop or the makings of a loop of a similar kind. Mr West had not previously noticed these A’s and he was cross-examined about this by Mr Bellew. Mr West’s answer was that there were twelve A’s in Exhibit Q, a relatively short document, all of which had the characteristic loop. While in the specimen document there were “the odd one or two” with a loop or the makings of a loop of a similar kind, there was not that degree of consistency overall. Mr West attributed considerable importance to this feature of consistency in Exhibit Q and discounted the importance of the few A’s in the other documents.  
      
       
     68 In his evidence in chief, Mr West said that he regarded the letter G in Exhibit Q as being significant. There were three G’s in Exhibit Q. The form of two of these G’s was that of the numeral 6. In cross-examination it was pointed out to Mr West that there were G’s in that form in some of the specimen documents. His answer was that the writing of a G in the form of a 6 was common but its significance in this case was that two out of three G’s used on Exhibit Q the G’s were written in that form. Again, his point was that the overall consistency of this idiosyncratic way of writing a G was the significant aspect. 
      
       
     69 Mr West gave like evidence in regard to the letter H. Again, Mr Bellew in cross-examination pointed out that particular characteristics relied on by Mr West in regard to a particular letter H in Exhibit Q appeared to some degree in the specimen documents. Mr West’s reply was that although specimen documents did contain H’s that bore some resemblance to the H in question, none was sufficiently close in form to cause him to alter his view that the H on Exhibit Q was written by a different person to the one who wrote the H’s on the specimen documents. 
      
       
     70 Mr West attributed importance to the fact that the letter C on Exhibit Q was written in such a way as to be connected to the letter that followed it. Mr Bellew pointed out that this occurred several times in the specimen documents. Mr West’s answer was that it occurred more frequently in Exhibit Q. 
      
       
     71 Mr West referred to the idiosyncratic form of the letter P, of which there was one example in Exhibit Q. There does not seem to have been a letter P written in this form on a specimen document. 
      
       
     72 Mr West referred to the letter O of which there were a number in Exhibit Q. Some of these contained a loop in an unusual form. In the specimen documents there were O’s that also contained loops. Mr West contended that the loop in the O’s in Exhibit Q was different. 
      
       
     73 Arguments of the same kind occurred in relation to other letters on Exhibit Q such as the letters M, F, T and E. In all of these Mr Bellew demonstrated that there were letters which appeared to be in similar form in the specimen documents to that used in Exhibit Q and Mr West countered by asserting either that there were differences in Exhibit Q in regard to these letters or that the consistency of the forms in Exhibit Q was significantly different to those in the specimen documents. 
      
       
        
       The methods used by Mr West 
        
       
     74 Mr Bellew criticised the methods used by Mr West. He submitted that Mr West had made an inadequate examination of the original documents. He pointed to the fact that Mr West placed his main focus on a comparison between Exhibit Q and the Zudick document, rather than paying equal and close attention to all the specimen documents. He noted that Mr West had not magnified the entries before studying them and did not have good photographic reproductions of the originals. He had not used a stereo microscope, he had not produced a micrograph, he had not used a drawing tube, he had had problems with illegibility of the documents, he had not kept his notes, and he had not used charts.  
      
       
     75 Mr Bellew correctly pointed out that Mr Westwood and Mr Holland conducted an exhaustive analysis of each relevant letter. Mr West did not. As I have explained he attributed more importance to the general shape and appearance of the letters. 
      
       
        
       Conclusion 
        
       
     76 Mr Bellew’s submissions as to the omissions and errors made by Mr West in his evidence in chief have force and, generally, I think they are correct. I also accept that there is force in his submissions about the respective methods used by the Crown witnesses on the one hand and Mr West on the other.  
      
       
     77 Other criticisms could be made of Mr West’s testimony. Some of his explanations for his errors were weak. At times he attached more importance to matters (such as the significance of the G’s in the form of sixes) than was deserved. At times he discounted features relied on by Mr Westwood and Mr Holland to a degree that did not appear warranted. I have referred to his tendency to argumentativeness and advocacy. All these matters undoubtedly affected Mr West’s credibility and weakened the persuasiveness of his opinions.  
      
       
     78 Nevertheless, I consider that these negative aspects of Mr West’s testimony were not such that his evidence as a whole and the conclusions to which he came were entirely discredited. Mr West was able to demonstrate, effectively, many features of the handwriting in Exhibit Q, readily visible to a lay person, that were not in the handwriting on the specimen documents. This afforded some cogency and probative value to his opinions. A jury might attach significant weight to his great experience and the fact that he had held positions of considerable responsibility and importance in the field for many years. Mr West maintained his opinions with conviction and I formed the view that a jury would not disregard the effect of his testimony. There was a common sense element in his approach that could appeal to a jury, at least to a degree sufficient to be capable of giving rise to some doubt on their part as to the authorship of Exhibit Q. 
      
       
     79 All in all I consider that, despite the sterling efforts of Mr Bellew and the high degree of professionalism and competence and, indeed, cogency of the Crown witnesses, there is a significant possibility that a jury would have a reasonable doubt that the appellant was the author of Exhibit Q. 
      
       
     80 I therefore conclude that the appellant is entitled to a fresh trial. That, however, is not the end of the inquiry. As I observed in R v Pedrana: 
      
       
        
         
         “It remains to have regard to any discretionary factors which may establish that it will be contrary to the interests of justice to order a new trial. In that event, as I have explained, the appellant would be entitled to an order for acquittal on discretionary grounds.” 
         
        
       
     81 As I mentioned earlier, the appellant has served the sentence that was imposed upon him in consequence of the conviction of 3 August 1989. That being so, and in the light of the long history of litigation in this matter, I think that there would be little point in a new trial. I consider that the interests of justice would best be served if a new trial was not ordered and a verdict of acquittal be entered. In the circumstances I propose that the appeal be upheld, the conviction be quashed and verdict of acquittal entered. 
      
       
     82 HIDDEN J: I agree with Ipp AJA. 
      
       
     83 BARR J: I agree with Ipp AJA.

      REGINA v Shane John RAVET 
       
       
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 STEIN JA: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against a sentence imposed on the respondent, Shane John Ravet, by Judge Williams in the District Court on 10 August 2001. 
      
       
     2 His Honour sentenced Mr Ravet on two counts. He had pleaded guilty to one count of break, enter and steal committed on 31 May 2000 (s 112 (1) Crimes Act 1900) and one count of break and enter with intent to commit a felony (s 113(1)) on 20 December 2000.  
      
       
     3 The respondent had also pleaded guilty before a local court to a break, enter and steal offence committed between 25 and 26 March 2000 and was committed for sentence pursuant to s 51A of the Justices Act 1902. This matter was also before his Honour on 10 August 2001. 
      
       
     4 With respect to each count on the indictment, his Honour sentenced the respondent to 2 years imprisonment to date from 20 December 2000 when he was taken into custody, with a non-parole period of 12 months to expire on 19 December 2001.  
      
       
     5 On the s 51A matter, his Honour sentenced the respondent to a section 9 bond to be of good behaviour for 2 years from 10 August 2001. 
      
       
     6 When ordering the release of the respondent to parole on 19 December 2001 his Honour said that it was on condition that he accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service, and that such supervision may include a direction to attend a residential drug rehabilitation programme. Similar conditions were also placed upon the s 9 bond. 
      
       
     7 His Honour described the offences as ‘run-of-the-mill break and enters’ of the shops after they had closed. Indeed they were. The offence of 31 May 2000 involved forcing a roller shutter door of a womens’ fashion shop at the Ashfield Mall. $200 disappeared from the cash register. The respondent left his fingerprints as a calling card.  
      
       
     8 The offence on 20 December 2000 was similar and involved a shoe store at the Mid City Centre in George Street, Sydney. On this occasion a security roller door was forced and the respondent apprehended by a security officer inside the premises. He was arrested by police and made verbal admissions.  
      
       
     9 The s 51A offence was from a menswear shop in a Chatswood shopping centre, again in similar circumstances. He left the store with a suit, tie and shirt and again, left his fingerprints on the roller shutter, as well as inside the store. 
      
       
     10 At the time of the offences the respondent was on parole with respect to a sentence for robbery in company, for which he had been convicted on 13 March 1998 and sentenced to 3 ½ years imprisonment. Parole was revoked in August 2000. 
      
       
     11 The respondent is 29 years of age, and has a lengthy criminal history dating back to 1987. This date appears to coincide with his commencement of serious drug use, mainly heroin. His offences have principally involved dishonesty but also include drug and assault matters and one escape from lawful custody which, if my recollection serves me correctly, he appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal, and the appeal was allowed, and he was re-sentenced.  
      
       
     12 It was estimated in evidence that the respondent has spent 75% of his last 14 years in juvenile institutions and prison. His longest period in the community appears to have been 15 months when he was on parole and committed the subject offences. 
      
       
     13 His Honour recorded the respondent’s personal circumstances in giving his reasons on sentence. The respondent’s parents separated when he was 4 years old and I have to recall that is the third matter I have heard in two days on the Court of Criminal Appeal this week when parents had separated when a child was four.  
      
       
     14 Reverting to the facts which his Honour recounted. Thereafter it appears that the respondent lived mainly with his grandmother, who is now 80 years of age. He has not seen his parents, or his brother, for 8 years.  
      
       
     15 The respondent had a long term relationship with a person who was also a drug user, and while on parole he had a relationship with a woman who did not use drugs. Unfortunately, this relationship broke down when the respondent resumed using heroin. He had apparently been drug free for about 6 months before that time.  
      
       
     16 The respondent left school at 14 years of age, although he returned for a brief period in which it seems he became involved in drug use. Shortly thereafter he abandoned his studies. The respondent’s work history has consisted of short term labouring jobs. 
      
       
     17 A pre-sentence report before his Honour concluded that the respondent was unsuitable for periodic detention, community service or a supervised bond, given his previous experiences with the Probation and Parole Service. 
      
       
     18 While in custody from 20 December 2000 to his sentencing in August 2001, it seems that the respondent ceased using illegal drugs and made good progress. He has been accepted as suitable for a rehabilitation programme at The Glen Rehabilitation Centre at Chittaway Point. This is scheduled to commence on 19 December 2001 when his parole would commence, that is, subject to this appeal. 
      
       
     19 Updating reports have been tendered to the Court which indicate that the respondent, who had not that long ago been diagnosed as having Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, has been making good progress while in gaol. He has completed a Life Management Stage 11 Programme and, according to Ms Mackie, his Drug Counsellor at the Lithgow Correctional Centre, has gained insight into his past self-defeating behaviour.  
      
       
     20 The respondent has successfully completed a 12 stage conflict resolution programme, as well as a number of horticultural courses. Ms Mackie says that it would be in the respondent’s best interests to progress to the Rehabilitation Centre to continue his motivation to remain drug free.  
      
       
     21 The respondent has only once before entered a residential drug rehabilitation programme, but it seems failed after only 6 weeks. I should mention that Ms Mackie, the drug counsellor, has had continuous contact with the respondent for a period of around three years, according to her reports. 
      
       
     22 Before his Honour the sentencing judge were a number of reports concerning the respondent, from his drug counsellor, a clinical psychologist, a psychiatrist and from the chaplain at Lithgow. 
      
       
     23 What I gain from this material, and from the respondent, is that at 29 years of age, with a lengthy criminal record, he appears to be at the crossroads. He could either relapse into drug abuse and criminal behaviour or turn the corner and end the cycle of drugs and crime. 
      
       
     24 The Director of Public Prosecutions submits that his Honour’s sentence failed to reflect the objective seriousness of the offences and allowed subjective factors to prevail. Further, that his Honour paid insufficient attention to a general and specific deterrence. 
      
       
     25 It is further submitted that his Honour did not make any findings of fact upon which to base his sentence. I do not accept this submission. The facts were before his Honour and the brief references made to the facts was sufficient in the circumstances. The offences were unremarkable and his Honour was right to refer to them as run-of-the-mill break and enters of shops after hours. 
      
       
     26 It is also submitted that his Honour fell into error by saying that the respondent’s problem was ‘principally medical rather than of a criminal nature’. This was a reference to the respondent’s drug addiction. 
      
       
     27 I do not see his Honour as stating more than the obvious. That is, unless the respondent was able to cease drug taking, he was likely to re-offend. To that extent his problem was a medical one. I do not see that his Honour’s observation meant that he treated the objective seriousness of the offences and the need for deterrence as of minor importance only or that he elevated rehabilitation to that of primary importance. His Honour properly acknowledged the seriousness of the offences and particularly because they were aggravated by their commission while on parole. Indeed, there is no doubt that this was a serious aggravating feature.28 Arguably of more persuasion is the DPP’s criticism of his Honour in not differentiating between the sentences, which were for distinct offences, one more serious than the other. His Honour gave no reasons why equal sentences were imposed and whether any accumulation was appropriate or otherwise. However, given the simple facts of the offences, there was very little distinction between them and it was not inappropriate to impose equal sentences. 
      
       
     29 A further criticism is made of his Honour’s finding of the existence of special circumstances in relation to the judge’s mention of the respondent’s age (29 at sentencing). However, the Crown accepts that other valid grounds existed for the finding of special circumstances.  
      
       
     30 Nonetheless, the DPP submits that the backdating of the sentence and the allowance for special circumstances have resulted in a sentence of little punitive effect. It is submitted that because of the breach of parole, the backdating of the sentences to 20 December 2000 was in error. The backdating by his Honour is of concern to the Court but, for reasons which I will mention later, I do not accept that the backdating was impermissible, although it may be said to be most unusual in the circumstances of this case. 
      
       
     31 In summary, and relying on the reading of the whole of the judgment of his Honour, the Crown contends that the sentences are unjustifiably lenient and manifestly inadequate. 
      
       
     32 On behalf of the respondent, it is submitted that the serious circumstance of aggravation, that the offences were committed while the respondent was on parole, was sufficiently acknowledged by his Honour in the sentences because, absent that aggravating factor, the offences were likely to have been assessed at the lower end of the scale. For example, there was no high level of damage to the premises, nor significant property stolen. Further, it was unlikely that there would be any encounter with occupiers, employees or members of the public because the stores were closed at the time of the offences. 
      
       
     33 Even with offenders with an ‘appalling’ record of criminal activity, including offences committed while on parole, there may be circumstances where a sentencing judge may properly conclude (within his or her discretion) that an offender should be afforded a chance to break a cycle of offending and embark on a realistic rehabilitation programme. In R v Caridi (Unreported, NSWCCA, 3 December 1987) the Court comprised Street CJ and Hunt and Newman JJ and the appeal involved an imposition by a District Court judge of a 7 month non-parole period in relation to an offence of robbery being armed and in company. In giving his reasons the Chief Justice said: 
      
       
        
         
         The particular circumstance that led to his Honour passing what was on its face such a short sentence, and specifying such a short non-parole period, [7 months] was the degree of assistance that the respondent provided to the prosecuting authorities in relation to the identification of the other persons involved and his readiness to assist the prosecution of those others. That, coupled with a further consideration which the criminal courts have long recognised, resulted in the order that has been stated. The further consideration is that his Honour took the view that at the respondent’s present age, thirty-two, and with an earlier life which included quite serious criminal offences, a stage had been reached where a grant of leniency might be just sufficient to turn the respondent away from continued involvement in crime. That recognition by the criminal courts of a critical time, usually in the order of about thirty years of age, when otherwise hardened criminals may prove responsive to some degree of leniency – not a total absence of punishment but some degree of leniency – has been recognised both in this country and elsewhere and his Honour so regarded the present respondent. 
         
        
       
     34 So long as the circumstance of aggravation is reflected in the sentence, there is authority that a sentence may be backdated to the commencement of custody provided the circumstance is justified, rather than accumulated on the unexpired term of parole. See for example R v Kaiva and R v Webb (Unreported, NSWCCA, 9 November 1998). I do not accept that these cases establish any principle. Rather, they are examples that such a step may obviously be within a judge’s sentencing discretion if the circumstances warrant. It is accepted here that the effect of the backdating by his Honour leaves a very short sentence indeed and, on one view, that may be seen to be an error. 
      
       
     35 In R v Allpass (1994) 73 A Crim R 561 the High Court acknowledged that if the Court decides to re-sentence an offender, it will normally recognise the element of double jeopardy involved by imposing a sentence of somewhat less than it considers should have been imposed by the trial judge. Moreover, the appellate court retains an overriding discretion not to intervene even if it concludes that error has been shown. 
      
       
     36 In my opinion, double jeopardy plays an important part in this case because, notwithstanding the DPP’s reasonable promptitude in indicating its intention to appeal and giving Notice of Appeal on 28 September 2001, the respondent is close to being released to parole. In fact, in only 13 days time on the19th December 2001. 
      
       
     37 The respondent has, on all accounts, been progressing well while in gaol. He is, according to those who have reported, demonstrated a commitment and motivation to rehabilitation which has never been present before. He has been assessed by The Glen Drug Rehabilitation Centre as suitable for its programme, which is a long-term one. The Programme Coordinator recommends that if the Court permits his attendance, he should be subject to supervision by the Probation and Parole Service and not be permitted to leave The Glen without the direction of the Service. If he leaves without permission or is discharged prematurely from the programme, the authorities will be notified by the Centre. 
      
       
     38 If the Court were to substitute a new sentence in lieu of his Honour’s, this would inflict a considerable hardship on the respondent, especially bearing in mind the closeness of his parole and his acceptance by The Glen. The impact on the respondent would be more considerable than perhaps is the usual case. In my view, particular significance should be given to the hardship which would be imposed on the respondent if he were to miss the opportunity of parole and admission to a long term residential drug rehabilitation programme. The progress which the respondent has achieved and was hoped for by his Honour, could be set at nought. 
      
       
     39 Without the significant element of double jeopardy and the evidence favourable to the respondent of his progress towards rehabilitation and the support he appears to be receiving in ridding his drug dependence, it is arguable that a longer sentence should be imposed. However, in the circumstances which I have discussed, I do not believe that the Court should intervene and re-sentence the respondent. 
      
       
     40 The appeal should be dismissed. 
      
       
     41 HIDDEN J: Clearly, it was open to his Honour to have dated the sentences passed upon the applicant from the date on which they were passed. They would then have been served partly cumulatively upon the balance of the sentence he was serving as a result of the revocation of his parole. That his Honour should have done so, in my view, was the Crown's strongest argument in this appeal notwithstanding the strides towards rehabilitation which the applicant had apparently begun at the time he appeared before his Honour. 
      
       
     42 It may well be that his Honour did fall into error in backdating the sentences in the way he did. However, I find it unnecessary to express any concluded view about that because, even if that were so, I am satisfied that the residual discretion of this Court demands that this appeal be dismissed, and I say so not only in the light of the material that was before his Honour but in the light of the fresh material which is now before this Court. 43 It is clearly in the community's interest at this stage that the respondent have the rehabilitative opportunities which are now available to him and available to him in the very immediate future. 
      
       
     44 I agree with the order proposed. 
      
       
     45 KIRBY J: I believe there was error. I believe that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate. It did not, in my view, reflect the objective seriousness of the offences with which the respondent was charged. The inadequacy principally arose through the backdating of the sentence to the date of the arrest. That, in my view, was inappropriate given that the respondent was then on parole. It had the effect, in my view, of rendering the non parole period inadequate. It was necessary that the non parole period should reflect “the minimum time that a judge determines justice requires that (the offender) must serve having regard to all the circumstances of the offence” (Deakin v The Queen (1984) 54 ALR 765 at 766; Bugmy v The Queen (1990) 169 CLR 525, per Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron JJ at 536).  
      
       
     46 However, as a matter of the overriding discretion, I am persuaded that this Court should not intervene for the reasons given by the presiding judge. 
      
       
     47 I therefore join in the orders that have been proposed. 
      
       
     48 STEIN JA: Accordingly the order of the Court is that the appeal is dismissed.

At trial the Crown formulated its case on alternative bases including felony murder and mens rea murder. After a trial before a judge and jury, both appellants were convicted of murder. Patsalis had two different counsel during the trial, both of whom he dismissed. Patsalis was sentenced to 21 years and 6 months of penal servitude with a minimum term of 16 years and an additional term of 5 years and 6 months. Spathis was sentenced to 19 years of penal servitude with a minimum term of 14 years and an additional term of 5 years. Both Patsalis and Spathis appealed against their convictions and applied for leave to appeal against their sentences. Only Patsalis advanced arguments in relation to sentence. Held by Heydon JA (Carruthers and Smart AJJ concurring): 1. Dismissing Patsalis’ appeal against conviction: 
     A. The factual issues to which Patsalis’ complaints on appeal  
      
       
        
         
         related, however decided, would not affect the Crown case as proved before the jury and as set out in the trial judge’s remarks on sentence.  
         
        
       
     B. There was no direct evidence of many of the factual allegations  
      
       
        
         
         made by Patsalis against his lawyers. These allegations could be supported, if at all, only by inferences from the transcript and the trial record generally. Nothing in Patsalis’ challenge to the performance of his lawyers demonstrated that they provided him with less than professional and capable service. 
         
        
       
     C. Although neither of Patsalis’ counsel had a junior, this did not  
      
       
        
         
         create a miscarriage of justice. None of the other counsel at the trial had a junior, and barristers without juniors conduct many serious criminal trials. 
         
        
       
     D. The two applications made by Patsalis to rely on further evidence on the appeal, should be refused: 
      
       
        
        i. The first matter (a statement from a travel consultant  
         
          
           
           relating to a conversation with Mrs Spathis) was not “fresh evidence” because either it was known to Patsalis or to his lawyers at the time of the trial, or it ought to have been known to them. Even if it was “fresh evidence” it went to credit and is unlikely to lead to a new trial.

           not have affected the admissibility at trial of Exhibit G (a statement written by Patsalis and handed to police).  
           
          
         
        
       
     E. The grounds of appeal advanced by Spathis, all of which were  
      
       
        
         
         adopted by Patsalis, were rejected for the same reasons as those for which they were rejected in relation to Spathis (see below).  
         
        
       
     2. Dismissing Patsalis’ application for leave to appeal against  
      
       
       sentence: 
        
        
        A. The sentence imposed upon Patsalis was not too severe for such a serious crime and there was no lack of parity between Patsalis’ sentence and Spathis’ sentence. Although the Crown did not submit that there was any difference in the culpability of each accused, the trial judge was entitled to reach his own view as to relative culpability. There was no convincing reason to doubt the trial judge’s factual findings, which were based upon his impressions of the credibility of witnesses and what was necessarily implicit within the jury verdict.  
         
        
       
     B. The trial judge did not err in deciding not to discount Patsalis’ sentence in relation to the assistance Patsalis gave to the police. The trial judge was entitled to conclude that Patsalis assisted police in order to incriminate Spathis, rather than to help police solve the crime. The trial judge was also entitled to conclude that the account that Patsalis gave to the police was untruthful, incomplete and unreliable. Held by Carruthers AJ (Heydon JA and Smart AJ concurring): 1. Dismissing Spathis’ appeal against conviction: 
     A. The Crown’s failure to include felony murder as a separate 
      
       
        
         
         count to mens rea murder in the indictment, did not cause Spathis unfairness to such an extent that his conviction should be set aside. It was open to the Crown to include the felony murder alternative in the one comprehensive murder count. The trial judge was not required to direct the jury that they must all be satisfied on at least one basis of liability. In this case, the alternate bases of liability did not involve materially different issues or consequences.

     B. The trial judge did not err in failing to direct the jury that a  
      
       
        
         
         manslaughter verdict was open. In order for manslaughter to be left to the jury, there must be an evidentiary basis for it. The Crown excluded beyond reasonable doubt all reasonable views of the facts that could be consistent with innocence of murder. The jury’s verdicts indicate that they were satisfied that either Patsalis or Spathis stabbed the victim. Manslaughter could not have arisen in relation to Spathis on either hypothesis.

     C. The trial judge did not err in his directions to the jury as to the  
      
       
       elements of felony murder within s 18(1) of the  
       Crimes Act  
       1900.  
       
     i. It was not necessary for the jury to be directed that for  
      
       
        
         
         Spathis to be guilty of felony murder, he must have  
         
        been aware that death or grievous bodily harm was  
         
        probable, rather than merely possible.

        concerning reckless indifference to human life  
         
        rather than felony murder). 
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         ii. It was not necessary for the jury to be directed that the  
          
          death of the victim must be a foreseeable result of the underlying felony. 
          
         
        
         
       R v Munro  
       (1981) 4 A Crim R 67, applied. 
        
         
          The critical question is whether the act causing death was  
          
          within the contemplation of the accessory in his role as a  
          
          principal in the original criminal enterprise. 
         
        
       
     D. The trial judge did not misdirect the jury as to the use of  
      
       
        
         
         relationship evidence (i.e.. Exhibit G - a statement written by Patsalis and handed to police). The evidence was not relied on by the Crown as propensity or tendency evidence. Rather, it was relationship evidence from which relevant inferences could be logically and reasonably drawn.  
         
        
       
     E. The trial judge did not err in permitting the Crown to cross- 
      
       
        
         
         examine Mrs Spathis as an unfavourable witness in its case pursuant to s 38(1)(c) of the  
         Evidence Act 
          1995. The Crown did not attempt to exploit the provisions in order to rectify damage done in cross-examination.

     F. The trial judge did not err in his directions to the jury as to  
      
       
       Spathis’ lies in relation to proof of the Crown case against him.  
       
     i. It was not necessary for the jury to be directed that the  
      
       
        
         
         lies were relevant only to Spathis’ credit, since the Crown  
          
         was clearly relying upon the lies as going directly to a  
          
         consciousness of guilt of the crime of murder.  
         
        Osland v The Queen 
         (1998) 197 CLR 333, distinguished. 
         
          
         ii. The trial judge made it sufficiently clear to the jury that  
          
          Spathis may have told the lies to avoid implication in offences other than murder. 
          
         
        
       
     G. The trial was not rendered unfair by reason of the trial judge’s  
      
       
       failure to grant a separate trial in circumstances where Patsalis  
        
         
         had decided to represent himself. There was not sufficient cause for concern that a potential miscarriage of justice may have occurred, and Spathis’ trial counsel did not apply for discharge of the jury or separate trials on this ground. 
         
        
       
     H. The failure by Spathis’ counsel to lead further evidence of  
      
       
        
         
         Spathis’ good character and to make applications for separate trials did not render Spathis’ trial unfair.  
          
         i. Considering the amount of evidence and the length of the  
          
           
           trial, Spathis’ counsel was entitled to decide not to call further character evidence, and was not “flagrantly incompetent”.

         ii. The overriding factor was that this was quintessentially a case for a joint trial. The interests of the Crown in having a joint trial must be considered in this regard.

      REGINA v Alexios SPATHIS 
       
      REGINA v Michael PATSALIS 
      
      
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
     1 HEYDON JA:  
      
       
       After a trial lasting 55 days before Kirby J and a jury, Michael Patsalis and Alexios Spathis were on 24 September 1999 convicted of murdering Klaus Peter Ludwig on 11 April 1996 at Botany. On 23 February 2000 Patsalis was sentenced to penal servitude for 21 years and 6 months, consisting of a minimum term of 16 years and an additional term of 5 years and 6 months. Spathis was sentenced to penal servitude for 19 years, consisting of a minimum term of 14 years and an additional term of 5 years.  
        
       
     2 Each has appealed against his conviction and sentence, though only Patsalis advanced arguments in relation to sentence. Accordingly Spathis’ application for leave to appeal against sentence will be dismissed. These reasons deal with Patsalis’ appeal. 
      
       
       
       Background 
       
     3 The background circumstances are important in understanding the grounds of Patsalis’ appeal. They are also important in evaluating the force of various arguments he advanced to the effect that there had been a miscarriage of justice because those arguments must be assessed in the light of the very strong Crown case. It is convenient to foreshadow a general conclusion: the factual issues to which Patsalis’ complaints go, however they were to be decided, would not affect the Crown case as proved before the jury and as set out in the trial judge’s remarks on sentence.  
      
       
        
         
         “Mr Patsalis and Mr Spathis each provided lengthy interviews to the police. Each gave evidence at the trial. Neither gave evidence on sentence. In some important respects their accounts correspond. In others they differ markedly. I will begin by identifying the common ground. 
          
          
         The Common Ground 
          
          
         Mr Patsalis and Mr Spathis were friends, although not of long standing. Mr Spathis had a business serving food at the Three Swallows Hotel. Mr Patsalis was a patron of that hotel. They shared certain interests. In the year or so before Mr Ludwig’s murder, Mr Spathis advanced $16,500 to Mr Patsalis by way of loan. They gave strikingly different accounts of the circumstances in which the debt accumulated. It was, however, acknowledged by Mr Patsalis that certain advances had been made in circumstances where he had deceived Mr Spathis. The money was used for gambling, and lost. Mr Patsalis was not in a position to repay the loan. And so the friendship soured. It was in the context of that debt, that Mr Patsalis became acquainted with Mr Ludwig. 
          
          
         Mr Ludwig had a small business restocking cigarette vending machines. One such machine was located in a small coffee house at Restwell Parade, Bankstown. The coffee house was frequented mainly by persons of Greek origin. They included Mr Patsalis. Mr Patsalis was attracted by a card game in which patrons played for money. Mr Patsalis met Mr Ludwig. He discussed with him the prospect of obtaining cheap cigarettes, which was a matter of interest to Mr Ludwig. Although Mr Patsalis may describe it otherwise, I am satisfied that he persuaded Mr Ludwig that he was able to arrange the supply of cheap cigarettes through contacts he had. Mr Ludwig, on the evening he met his death, believed that he was travelling to a warehouse at Botany where he would exchange the cash he was carrying ($58,500) for a large consignment of contraband cigarettes. 
          
          
         The accounts given by Mr Patsalis and Mr Spathis as to the events before and after the stabbing of Mr Ludwig were not remarkably different. They met at 3.00pm at Mr Patsalis’ flat. Thereafter a number of purchases were made. There were two pairs of gloves, two knives, a tarpaulin, and one tin of petrol. Mr Patsalis and Mr Spathis differed from each other as to the circumstances in which the purchases were made, and their knowledge of the items purchased. They both denied having any appreciation of the sinister purpose of these items, as revealed by the events of that evening. I will return to this issue shortly. 
          
          
         Arrangements were thereafter made to meet Mr Ludwig at Bankstown. Two vehicles were driven from Bankstown to the Marrickville RSL. Mr Spathis drove his car [POZ 344]. Mr Patsalis was a passenger in the truck driven by Mr Ludwig. It was common ground that Mr Spathis, having left first, doubled back in order to follow the truck, and thereby ensure that the truck was not being followed. This fact was communicated to Mr Patsalis. Both, therefore, knew that Mr Ludwig was alone. 
          
          
         Once at Marrickville, Mr Spathis parked his car. He then entered the truck, sitting alongside Mr Ludwig, with Mr Patsalis on the other side, nearest the door. Mr Spathis then drove to Botany. 
          
          
         At some point the vehicle parked by the side of the road at Botany. Whilst parked, Mr Ludwig was stabbed. Mr Patsalis and Mr Spathis each blamed the other for the stabbing. Each asserted ignorance of the sinister purpose of the other. Both acknowledged that money was removed from Mr Ludwig’s jacket after the stabbing by Mr Spathis. Mr Spathis asserted (and Mr Patsalis denied) that he did so at the direction of Mr Patsalis. 
          
          
         Mr Spathis drove the truck back to Marrickville with Mr Patsalis as a passenger. Mr Ludwig’s body remained in the cabin. Mr Patsalis then alighted. He thereafter drove Mr Spathis’ vehicle. Mr Patsalis was covered with blood. The car seat was protected by the plastic tarpaulin purchased earlier in the day. 
          
          
         The two vehicles were driven to Terrey Hills, although by a circuitous route. Each asserted the other led the way. At Terrey Hills the body was removed from the cabin by Mr Spathis, and left by the side of the road. It was doused in petrol. Further money was removed from the jacket of the deceased. The body was then set alight. There were differences as to who removed the money, and who set fire to the body.  
          
          
         The vehicles then left the scene, although in circumstances which were somewhat chaotic. The burning of the body, and the rapid exit from the area, were witnessed by the occupants of a number of vehicles which were in the area. 
          
          
         The vehicles proceeded to Mr Patsalis’ flat at Homebush. Mr Spathis drove the truck, whilst Mr Patsalis remained in Mr Spathis’ car. Having met at Homebush, the two vehicles were then driven to Chester Hill, where the truck was set alight. Mr Patsalis placed his bloodstained clothes inside the truck, so that they were also destroyed. 
          
          
         The Crown Case 
          
          
         The Crown contended, and the jury accepted, that both Mr Patsalis and Mr Spathis were responsible for Mr Ludwig’s murder. The Crown case was put in three ways. 
          
         
        
       
     · First, a joint attack by both accused. Two knives had been purchased. Mr Patsalis and Mr Spathis were arranged on either side of Mr Ludwig. The wounds were consistent with both knives (or either knife), although it was not possible to say, simply based upon the wounds, whether they came from the left or the right, or from both directions. 
      
       
     · Secondly, a joint criminal enterprise to either rob and/or murder Mr Ludwig. If the agreement was to rob, it was the Crown case that the accused who did not do the stabbing was aware of the possibility (amounting to a substantial risk) that, in the course of the robbery, his co-accused may intentionally kill, or cause grievous bodily harm, to the person being robbed, Mr Ludwig. 
      
       
     · The third basis upon which the Crown suggested that both accused were responsible, was felony murder, either as the person who stabbed the deceased, or  
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
           ‘… being aware that the co-accused was armed with a knife, the accused was aware that there was a substantial risk that his co-accused might immediately before, during, or immediately after the commission of the robbery, stab (the victim) seriously injuring him or killing him.’ 
            
           
          
         … 
          
          
         The Gravity of the Crime 
          
          
         By any standard, this was a cold-blooded and shocking crime. The deceased was lured into a trap. He was alone. There was no suggestion that he was armed. He was out-numbered. He was taken at night to a deserted location where he was attacked. He was repeatedly stabbed, such that he died almost at once. Counsel for Mr Spathis submitted that the wounds suggested frenzy, and were consistent with panic. Certainly, there were multiple wounds, front and back, and to the head. The victim was given no chance. There is nothing in the evidence which suggests panic to my mind. Mr Ludwig was deliberately slain where he sat, between Mr Patsalis and Mr Spathis. 
          
          
         Premeditation 
          
          
         The Crown asserts that the crime was premeditated, and that is a circumstance of aggravation. Counsel for Mr Spathis sought to refine the issue by asking what crime was planned? It was said, on behalf of Mr Spathis, that the Court should not find beyond reasonable doubt that there was premeditation of murder. Rather, the crime in contemplation, in respect of which there was planning, was robbery, where one at least of those involved was carrying a weapon. Although the same submissions were not made on behalf of Mr Patsalis, the same issue arises. It requires an examination of the events which preceded the stabbing. 
          
          
         It was Mr Patsalis who befriended Mr Ludwig. He sought to gain his confidence. They met a number of times at the Restwell Parade coffee shop, and at the Bankstown Sports Club. Mr Patsalis gave evidence that, on Saturday 6 March 1996 (five days before the murder), he discussed at length the purchase by Mr Ludwig of contraband cigarettes for cash. I have no doubt that he persuaded Mr Ludwig to become involved. He did so, knowing that there were no cigarettes on offer. 
          
          
         Mr Patsalis’ purpose, rather, was crime. I will leave to one side, for the moment, the nature of that crime. Certainly, his purpose included robbing Mr Ludwig of the cash which he was required to bring to a meeting which was then organised. 
          
          
         Mr Patsalis gave an account to the jury which involved Mr John Spathis, an uncle of Mr Alexios Spathis. He said that he believed, as Mr Ludwig believed, that Mr John Spathis had available a large consignment of contraband cigarettes. He described discussions with Mr John Spathis, before the murder, concerning such cigarettes. Mr John Spathis, it should be said, had a small supermarket at Ashfield. He stocked, amongst other things, cigarettes. Mr Patsalis said that Mr John Spathis had told him that he had spoken to Mr Ludwig. 
          
          
         It is reasonable to suppose that the jury rejected Mr Patsalis’ account. It is hardly surprising that they should have done so. It was implausible. In a lengthy interview to the police upon his arrest, Mr Patsalis made a passing reference to Mr Alexios Spathis’ uncle. He did not include the detail of the matters which were to emerge as his ‘defence’. His account, moreover, was not supported by the text of the letter Mr Ludwig left behind, written the day before his murder (Exhibit AX). I repeat, that I have no doubt that Mr Patsalis knew full well that there were no cigarettes on offer, and that he was luring Mr Ludwig into a trap. 
          
          
         I have made reference already to the purchases which were made on the afternoon of 11 April 1996, the day Mr Ludwig was murdered. The meeting with Mr Ludwig was arranged for 5.00 pm. As it happened, he was late. He arrived shortly after 5.30 pm. Between 3.45 pm and 4.38 pm a number of items were purchased. The times of each purchase can be fixed with precision by reference to the computer print-out of the cash registers within the stores from which the purchases were made. The items purchased were as follows: 
          
         
        
       
     · At 3.35 pm from BBC Hardware, Yagoona, two pairs of gloves, and one blue tarpaulin/ground sheet. 
      
       
     · Between 4.00 pm and 4.20 pm, a can of petrol from a Mobil service station at Yagoona. 
      
       
     · At 4.38 pm at K-Mart, Bankstown Square, two knives (one with a 7 inch blade and the other with a 9 inch blade), each within a protective knife sharpener, which was like a scabbard. 
      
       
        
         
         It may be helpful if I first state the position of each prisoner in respect of these purchases. Mr Patsalis acknowledged that he made the first purchase (at 3.45 pm). Mr Spathis was not present. Mr Spathis denied knowledge of the gloves. He saw the blue tarpaulin, but thought nothing of it. 
          
          
         Mr Patsalis also made the purchase of the can of petrol. He did so on the instructions of Mr Spathis. Mr Spathis acknowledged having given those instructions. They were given because he noticed his car was running low on fuel. Mr Spathis said that he did not enter the petrol station because he was aware that petrol stations have video surveillance. He had no wish to be filmed in circumstances where he was assisting in a transaction which involved contraband cigarettes. The petrol was in a 5 litre tin. It was put in the boot. It was not added to the tank. 
          
          
         Mr Patsalis was present when the knives were purchased from K-Mart. He insisted that they were purchased by Mr Spathis. He was sufficiently concerned to enquire of Mr Spathis as to his purpose. He was told that they were required for Mr Spathis’ business at the hotel. That explanation satisfied him. 
          
          
         Mr Spathis denied having purchased the knives. He waited in the car park at K-Mart whilst Mr Patsalis made the purchases. When Mr Patsalis returned to the car, he was carrying a shopping bag. Mr Spathis asserted that he was not aware of the contents of the shopping bag, namely the knives, before the stabbing. 
          
          
         Mr Patsalis therefore knew of each purchase; the two pairs of gloves, the tarpaulin, the petrol and the knives. He said he had no appreciation of the purpose of these items, and specifically their connection with the crime which was about to occur. The jury verdict may be taken as a rejection of that assertion, at least in respect of the knives. The jury was directed that it was an essential circumstance in the Crown case that each accused should have known of the knives, or at least one knife, and should have been aware of the possibility (amounting to a substantial risk) that his co-accused may use the knife to rob Mr Ludwig or cause him serious harm.  
          
          
         The Crown attached considerable significance to the purchases made that afternoon. The purchase of two knives and two pairs of gloves pointed to a joint criminal enterprise between Mr Patsalis and Mr Spathis, in its submission. 
          
          
         The goods purchased, moreover, defined the nature and scope of the enterprise according to the Crown. They were the tools for the night’s work. The knives were to attack Mr Ludwig. The gloves were to avoid fingerprints. The petrol was to burn the body and the truck. The tarpaulin was ultimately used that evening to protect Mr Spathis’ car. Mr Patsalis’ trousers were soaked in blood. The tarpaulin prevented the transfer of that blood to the car seat. It is possible that the tarpaulin may have been intended to wrap Mr Ludwig’s body. 
          
          
         I am satisfied that Mr Patsalis had these purposes in mind, and that there was, in his case, premeditation of murder.  
          
          
         Mr Spathis is in a slightly different position. On his own account, he was aware of the tarpaulin, and the petrol. I accept that Mr Spathis was not present when the knives were purchased from K-Mart. However, by the jury verdict, he must be taken to have been aware of at least one knife, and the purpose of that knife, namely, to rob or cause serious harm to Mr Ludwig. It was urged on behalf of Mr Spathis that I should not find (beyond reasonable doubt) premeditation of murder. If one confined oneself to matters which Mr Spathis acknowledges he knew, or which he can be taken to have known, by reason of the verdict, that may be so. However, in drawing the appropriate inference, I do not believe that the available material is so limited. Mr Patsalis gave the following account to the police of an episode at the Marrickville RSL. It provides insight into the role of Mr Spathis on this evening. Mr Spathis, having parked his car at Marrickville, then joined Mr Ludwig and Mr Patsalis at the truck. According to Mr Patsalis, there was an argument about who should drive the truck. Mr Patsalis, in his interview to the police the day after the murder, described what happened in these words: 
          
          
           
           ‘Then what occurs was – and they had a bit of a dispute about this – was who should drive the truck. Alex wanted to drive the truck, Peter wanted to drive the truck. Alex said to him, ‘Listen, I want to make sure that we’re not being followed.’ And he goes to him, ‘Crikey, he takes a lot of precautions’, something along those lines. He goes, ‘I’m, the one who should be worried.’ Alex said to him, ‘Well, listen, I know the way and it’s better for me to drive because that way I don’t have to tell you to turn right and turn left at the last moment and you miss a turn,’ and so he convinced Peter to allow him to drive. And Peter made a big fuss over that if Alex was to have an accident that Alex would pay for the damage.’ 
            
           
          
         Mr Spathis denied that account. However, I have no doubt that it occurred. Mr Ludwig had hired the vehicle from Thrifty Rent-A-Car. The Hiring Agreement included a clause (Exhibit W), which stated ‘No other driver permitted’. 
          
          
         Mr Patsalis’ account is consistent with the Hiring Agreement, and the picture of Mr Ludwig which emerged from the evidence. I infer that it was important to the arrangements between Mr Patsalis and Mr Spathis that evening that Mr Spathis should drive the truck. 
          
          
         Counsel submitted that each of these matters was consistent with the possibility that the common purpose was robbery (with possible wounding), rather than murder. The petrol may have been purchased to burn the truck. Mr Ludwig, when stripped of his money, could hardly complain to the police. He had chosen to embark upon what he knew was an illegal enterprise. 
          
          
         However, I am not persuaded. I accept in the case of Mr Spathis, as I did in the case of Mr Patsalis, that there was premeditation of murder. I do accept, nonetheless, that Mr Patsalis was the dominant party in the enterprise. It was Mr Patsalis who planned the crime. It was Mr Patsalis who seduced Mr Ludwig into believing that there were cigarettes on offer. It was Mr Patsalis who made the purchases. Mr Patsalis persuaded Mr Spathis to assist him. Mr Spathis, weakly, agreed to do so. 
          
          
         … 
          
          
         Mr Patsalis before these events, was a compulsive gambler. His gambling lies at the heart of his involvement in this crime. He is described by Dr Lisa Brown, psychiatrist, as a pathological gambler.” 
          
          
         
        
       
     4 In discussing a submission by Patsalis that he should be given a discount for assisting the police, the trial judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “There is no question in my mind that Mr Patsalis recognised that the crime, in its execution, had gone badly wrong. It appears that Mr Spathis may have panicked when at Terrey Hills, so that Mr Ludwig’s body was left by the side of a suburban road, where it was then set alight. However it came about, Mr Patsalis appreciated that they had been seen. I accept the account of Mr Spathis, given to the police the day following the murder, where he attributed to Mr Patsalis these words, spoken as they were about to part company: 
          
           
            
           ‘He said, ‘Don’t say anything ever, you know, even if, even if, you know, you get caught, you know, if, if your name, ‘cause they seen your car.’ 
            
           
          
         Either shortly before, or shortly after, saying these words, Mr Patsalis determined that he would go to the police. He went to the Hilton Hotel at 4.00 am the morning following the murder. He began to write out his story. He presented himself at the Bankstown Police Station shortly after 6.00 pm. His motive was entirely self interest. It had nothing to do with assisting the authorities to solve the crime. It was a pre-emptive strike against Mr Spathis. Nonetheless, Mr Patsalis provided the police with important information concerning Mr Spathis, and the crime. Because it served his purpose (in that he was less likely to slip up), he substantially related events as they occurred. However, he omitted entirely his role in these events. The information provided by Mr Patsalis could hardly be described as full and frank. It did, however, contribute to the success of the prosecution against Mr Spathis, and also, ironically, against Mr Patsalis himself. In blaming Mr Spathis, Mr Patsalis unwittingly incriminated himself.” 
         
        
       
       
        
       The nature of Patsalis’ submissions 
       
     5 Patsalis was not represented on the hearing of the appeal. His oral submissions were relatively brief. Most of his submissions were advanced in written documents which he had prepared with little assistance. They were supplied in five parts. Two were supplied before oral argument, one late on the first day of the appeal, and the others after the court had reserved judgment. The first consisted of 93 pages (principally attacking Mr MacGregor QC), to which were attached a further 36 pages (principally attacking Mr Amor-Smith). The second consisted of 10 pages (principally dealing with the failure of both counsel to secure a separate trial). The third consisted of 56 pages (principally dealing with attempts to tender further evidence on the appeal and with Mr Amor-Smith’s alleged incompetence). The fourth (97 pages) repeated and developed various earlier submissions. The fifth (24 pages) dealt with sentence. The submissions annexed a substantial amount of evidentiary material and referred to a great deal more. Not surprisingly, the Crown felt obliged to respond to these bulky submissions at some length. Because they are repetitive and ill-organised, it is far from easy to reduce Patsalis’ submissions to order, summarise them coherently and consider them in a concise way.  
      
       
       
       Spathis’ grounds of appeal 
       
     6 Patsalis adopted all the grounds of appeal advanced by Spathis. Those grounds are rejected for the reasons given by Carruthers AJ in relation to Spathis’ appeal.  
      
       
        
       Incompetence of Patsalis’ lawyers: background 
       
     7 Patsalis expressed the initial grounds of his appeal against conviction as follows. 
      
       
        
         
         “In support of the notice of appeal which was previously lodged the appellant agitates the following grounds of appeal: 
          
          
         1. Procedure – Defence counsel fails to put case to Crown witnesses – form of the ‘Browne v Dunn’ direction (UK Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67). 
          
          
         A. Evidence – Witnesses – Cross-examination – Need to cross-examine on case on which reliance to be placed – Rule in Browne v Dunn – Criminal Proceedings – Part of defence case not put – Application to criminal proceedings – Consequences of failure to observe rule – Inferences to be drawn – Caution in directing on. 
          
          
         B. Criminal Law – Evidence – Burden of proof – Defences – Need to cross-examine on case on which reliance to be placed – Rule in Browne v Dunn – Criminal proceedings – Part of defence case not put – Application to criminal proceedings – Consequences of failure to observe rule – Inferences to be drawn – Caution in directing on. 
          
          
          Criminal law – Conduct of legal practitioners – Incompetence of counsel – Relevant principals. 
          
          
         C. Criminal law – Miscarriage of justice – Improper admission of evidence. 
          
          
         D. Legal Practitioners – Barristers – Incompetence of counsel – Criminal trial – Whether ground for contending miscarriage of justice – Relevant principals.” 
          
          
         
        
       
     8 Despite the way in which these grounds of appeal are expressed, the essential complaint was that the lawyers representing Patsalis had behaved with such incompetence as to cause him prejudice amounting to a miscarriage of justice.  
      
       
     9 The trial, which ran for a much longer period than it was originally contemplated that it would, proved to be a difficult one. There was scarcely any procedural issue on which the parties agreed, and on most of them each party had a separate position, usually not precisely coincident with that taken up by the trial judge. This led to repeated interruptions in the flow of evidence before the jury. There were difficulties caused by illnesses, late arrivals and absences on the part of jurors, counsel and Patsalis. But the greatest difficulties were created by Patsalis’ dismissal of his two counsel and his solicitors. Patsalis was represented by Mr M MacGregor QC from at a time just before the commencement of the trial on Monday 28 June 1999 until Friday 23 July 1999, when Patsalis dismissed him. Patsalis was represented by Mr J Amor-Smith from Friday 30 July 1999, and Mr Amor-Smith announced his appearance on Monday 2 August 1999. On 2 September 1999 Patsalis dismissed him. Throughout the periods in which Patsalis had counsel, he was also represented by solicitors. They withdrew from the case on 27 July, but returned to it on the same day. The attack on them was much less specific than on counsel.  
      
       
       
       Legal principles 
       
     10 Patsalis referred to the principles of law stated in relation to incompetent representation in R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 679F, 685B-F, 689G and 703A. He referred to numerous cases relating to the rule in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67, particularly R v Foley (1998) 105 A Crim R 1 (Qld CA). In fact, despite the terms of the grounds of appeal set out above, his submissions did not centre on breach of the rule in Browne v Dunn; instead they selected particular passages from R v Foley which were said to advance other contentions.  
      
       
     11 The essence of the test to which Patsalis appealed in relation to his lawyers’ alleged incompetence turns on whether there has been a miscarriage of justice, whether caused by the flagrant incompetence of counsel or otherwise. The most favourable authorities from Patsalis’ point of view are those holding that a miscarriage of justice may be found if the court has a lurking doubt that an appellant has suffered some injustice because of incompetent advocacy.  
      
       
       
       General nature of attack on Mr MacGregor 
       
     12 Patsalis’ attacks on the competence of Mr MacGregor face several hurdles. 
      
       
     13 One group of hurdles consists of statements by the trial judge, counsel for other parties, and Patsalis himself. The trial judge told Patsalis, the day after Mr MacGregor had been dismissed, that “his conduct of the case on your behalf appeared to be completely professional”. Perhaps less materially, both the Crown, expressly, and counsel for Spathis, implicitly, praised it immediately after Mr MacGregor was dismissed. Even Patsalis said that Mr MacGregor’s “knowledge and application of the law was exceptional and beyond reproach”, and that he followed instructions while the court was actually sitting.  
      
       
     14 Another hurdle is that in large measure Patsalis’ criticisms rest on factual contentions which could only succeed if supported by evidence (for example, that Mr MacGregor failed to follow pre-trial instructions and failed to seek appropriate instructions). There is no evidence to support them. 
      
       
     15 Despite these hurdles, Patsalis made the following general complaints about Mr MacGregor. He lacked the time to prepare for the trial, and failed to read all the relevant material. He failed to understand the complex nature of the brief. He was not fully instructed, and failed to understand instructions given to him by Patsalis. On occasion (it is alleged without evidence) he approached the dock to obtain instructions in the presence of the jury, creating an undesirable spectacle in comparison with the position of Spathis “in the dock, at least, having been afforded the opportunity to fully brief counsel with instructions and having a case fully prepared”. In consequence he relied “on advocacy skills in law to conceal a lack of knowledge and understanding” of the case and of the evidence. He failed to visit and investigate the sites visited by the appellants on 11 and 12 April 1996. He failed to have appropriate subpoenas issued. He failed to obtain “independent certificates of expert evidence”. He failed to call independent witnesses to contradict the Crown case and Spathis’ assertions. He failed successfully to object to the reception of inadmissible exhibits.  
      
       
     16 In consequence of these failures, it was alleged that he did not properly cross-examine the Crown witnesses. He asked questions which invited witnesses to answer by commenting on the truthfulness of other witnesses.  
      
       
     17 He did not seek judicial directions which would overcome the consequences of the above difficulties, and Patsalis himself lacked the legal knowledge to do so.  
      
       
     18 All these factors made the result unsafe, and unfairly influenced the jury on the all-important matter of Patsalis’ credit.  
      
       
       
       Patsalis’ affidavit 
       
     19 Patsalis read an affidavit sworn by him on 25 July 2001. The Crown then objected to many parts of it. Patsalis then indicated he wished to withdraw the affidavit, a course to which the Crown did not object.  
      
       
     20 As has already been indicated, Patsalis made many specific factual allegations against his lawyers. For example, Patsalis submitted that by 2 July 1999 it was “clear that counsel had not read the majority of the material” and that at a conference between himself and Mr MacGregor on 1 July 1999 “counsel was familiarising himself with the ERISP material”. The consequence of there being no affidavit before this Court from Patsalis is that there is no direct evidence of many factual allegations which Patsalis made against his lawyers, and they can be supported if at all, only by inferences from the transcript and the trial record generally. 
      
       
       
       History 
       
     21 It is convenient to set out as a matter of background the history of the trial with particular reference to matters to which Patsalis pointed on the appeal as supporting his argument that there was a miscarriage of justice because of his lawyers’ incompetence.  
      
       
     22 The trial commenced on Monday 28 June 1999. Mr MacGregor QC, an extremely experienced criminal counsel of nearly forty years’ standing, announced his appearance for Patsalis. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         “There are some problems in relation to my retainer. I would need to announce my appearance pro bono at the moment until certain events may happen during the course of the day. The reasons for that are set out in [a letter of 8 June 1999 to the Legal Aid Commission].” 
          
         
        
       
       
       The rest of the day was spent in discussing procedural questions, particularly those relating to an application which Mr MacGregor made for a separate trial. 
        
       
     23 On Tuesday 29 June 1999, the second day of the trial, Mr MacGregor indicated that most of the difficulties with the Legal Aid Commission had gone, and that he proposed to continue in the matter. The bulk of that day was spent in the trial judge hearing Mr MacGregor’s application for a separate trial. Late that day Mr MacGregor requested a daily transcript free of charge. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I foreshadow that unless the government of New South Wales, either through the office of the Director of Public prosecutions or the court system or otherwise affords to my client free of charge a day-to-day transcript of the trial then I will make an application for the trial for my client be permanently stayed, or stayed until such time as he has the benefit given to both the judge and the Crown to have a detailed daily record of the evidence, it being professionally incumbent upon me to take proper objection to assist your Honour to determine the case according to law, which is a duty because I do not have total recall or the facility to take a full note, nor do I have a junior, I will be seriously impeded and wholly unfairly impeded in the proper conduct of the defence if the playing field is so imbalanced that the State makes a copy of the transcript freely available to the prosecutor and denies it to an accused on Legal Aid.” 
          
          
         
        
       
     24 On Wednesday 30 June 1999, the third day of the trial, the trial judge rejected Patsalis’ application for separate trials.  
      
       
     25 On Thursday 1 July 1999 the court did not sit. 
      
       
     26 On Friday 2 July 1999, the fourth day of the trial, Mr MacGregor said at the outset: 
      
       
        
         
         “I indicated to your Honour on the first day of the trial that I was appearing in the matter pro bono until such time as I would be adequately compensated for the trial. For the purpose of the pro bono aspect of the matter I spent some time reading as much of the material as I could and preparing submissions. I spent some five and a half hours of viewing video. The Legal Aid Commission pays for no conferences at the start and two conferences per week thereafter at $120 per conference. 
          
          
         In order for me to discharge my professional duty I set about having a full day’s conference with my client yesterday. At that stage I believed that I might have to open to the jury some time this afternoon so I was concerned to sort out in my mind what had to be done in the time available, in the expectation that the matter would be called on today. When I was informed that it was not to be called on today it was clear that I would have to spend all weekend preparing for the trial on Monday. I don’t make any point about that but it does impose enormous obligations upon us. 
          
          
         On Tuesday I had a conversation with Mr Power [counsel for the Crown], knowing he was anxious to open the case and I indicated that I would go through the material and indicate to him, if I was able, at about 3 o’clock yesterday afternoon any issues that arose.  
          
          
         I commenced a conference at about 9.20 or 9.30 in the morning with my client, who was under some considerable stress; I was in conference all afternoon until Mr Power rang me on my direct line and complained about breaches of undertakings.” 
          
          
         
        
       
     27 Mr MacGregor then said, referring to what became Exhibit G, a statement written out by Patsalis before he went to the police on 12 April 1996 and which he handed over to them: 
      
       
        
         
         “The other matter I have to investigate and I have not been able to investigate but had proposed to do so this morning if I were not occupied so unnecessarily, was to ascertain from my client precisely the circumstances of what warning he was given before the production of that document.” 
          
          
         
        
       
     28 Mr MacGregor a little later said: “I’ve not had a chance to fully prepare my client’s defence”. The trial judge replied: 
      
       
        
         
         “I must say I don’t under-estimate for one moment the enormity of the task the defence and for that matter the prosecution has in being ready for this trial and I don’t under-estimate in particular the problems that Mr MacGregor has relating to his retainer.” 
          
         
        
       
       
       Later on Mr MacGregor said: 
        
         
         “I have given full advice to my solicitor and because English is not his native language there is a little bit of a problem there but it can be resolved.” 
          
         
        
       This was a reference to Mr Ho, a solicitor working in the firm of which Mr Coustas was a principal.  
        
       
     29 On Monday 5 July 1999, the fifth day of the trial, Mr MacGregor said he had now obtained instructions about Exhibit G. The indictment was read, the accused pleaded not guilty, and a jury was empanelled. A problem about the empanelling then arose, and the jury were discharged. Mr MacGregor and other counsel then debated various issues of evidentiary admissibility for the rest of the day. In that period Mr MacGregor showed considerable familiarity with the documents he was dealing with – certainly equal to that of the other counsel. 
      
       
     30 On Tuesday 6 July 1999, the sixth day of the trial, those debates continued. While Mr MacGregor was objecting to what became Exhibit G, the following exchange took place with the trial judge: 
      
       
        
         
         “HIS HONOUR: But if it transpires that the evidence is that Mr Patsalis simply turned up at the Bankstown police station and said to the constable on the desk; I have just witnessed a murder; I have prepared a document in this book which I now hand you, which gives some background to the story, I would like to tell the police about it, and hands it over, then how can there be any suggestion in that circumstance of any impropriety? 
          
          
         MAGREGOR: With respect, that is not really the question. I think the question is this, is it not; we don’t know what arose before the document was handed over. If Mr Patsalis, for instance, had said – and I have no instructions to this effect – but if there was sufficient communication between a person who came in off the street to say: I know you are investigating the setting fire to the body in Frenchs Forest last night, I was there when the fellow was stabbed, and I was there when the body was set fire to, then clearly there is information in the hands of the police arising from that statement which gives rise to the necessity to warn the person against self incrimination.” 
          
         
        
       
       
       The indictment was then read again, the accused pleaded not guilty again, and a second jury was empanelled. They were told they could go and need not return until Monday 12 July 1999. The rest of the day was spent on taking evidence on the voir dire from a police officer in relation to Exhibit G.  
        
       
     31 Wednesday 7 July 1999, the seventh day of the trial, commenced with the following statement by Mr MacGregor: 
      
       
        
         
         “I have got a couple of housekeeping matters. My instructing solicitors are in the course of preparing subpoenas to be directed to the police officers Bowditch, Cook, Young and Jubelin for the production of their notebooks and duty books and contemporaneous records relating to their attendance on 12 April 1996; and subpoenas for the attendance to give evidence on the voir dire of Detectives Cook, Bowditch and Jubelin.” 
          
          
         
        
       
     32 On Monday 12 July 1999, the eighth day, Mr MacGregor, on instructions, asked that a particular juror be discharged. After that matter was dealt with, the jury was addressed by the judge and all counsel. The taking of police evidence on the voir dire then resumed. 
      
       
     33 That process was continued on the ninth day, Tuesday 13 July 1999. In the course of Mr MacGregor’s cross-examination of Detective Hull, he expressed a desire to see a certain police record. The trial judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I think to some degree, though perhaps not completely, in fairness, the issues were predictable and perhaps ought to have been predicted and covered by subpoenas in advance so that one wouldn’t have forever a postponing of the actual time at which one finally concludes the evidence.” 
          
         
        
       
       
       Mr MacGregor responded: 
        
         
         “Indeed. My response to that, may say two things, first, I indicated to your Honour the extraordinarily difficult position I, as counsel, are placed, particularly as senior counsel undertaking responsibility of a murder trial and the circumstances in which that arose, and particularly the reticence of the police to provide this information fully and immediately.” 
          
         
        
       The Crown undertook to make inquiries with a view to having the records brought to court. The first witness to give evidence before the jury was then called. Mr MacGregor cross-examined that witness, Mr Jefferis, without apparent difficulty. He was followed into the witness box by Mrs Jefferis. Mr MacGregor began to cross-examine her.  
        
       
     34 On Wednesday 14 July 1999, the tenth day, the Crown announced that the documents sought by Mr MacGregor had been produced. Mr MacGregor and the Crown then put submissions on the voir dire. The trial judge said, in relation to the notice requirements in relation to material in the records of interview which might be tendency evidence: 
      
       
        
         
         “I assume that the statement and the ERISP indeed formed part of that committal, that it was served in the usual way after the committal, that the accused and those representing him have been on notice of this material, so that the only issue is that there has apparently been, by oversight, no formal communication that reliance would be had upon this provision of the Evidence Act in so far as the material fell within it.” 
          
         
        
       
       
       The transcript then records: 
        
         
         “MACGREGOR: Well to the extent that your Honour may be thought to have been critical of the conduct of the defence for not issuing subpoenas, the absence of notice is directly relevant to that question. Now I don’t suggest for one moment that your Honour’s criticism – conduct of the defence is really relevant and I don’t apprehend that your Honour’s criticism was a severe censure. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: It wasn’t. 
          
          
         MAGREGOR: But your Honour can see what I’m suggesting. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: Well -- 
          
          
         MAGREGOR: If there was no notice we could not be criticised for not dealing with the matter in advance until such time as we had notice that it was sought to be raised.” 
          
         
        
       The case soon after resumed in the presence of the jury. Mr MacGregor completed his cross-examination of Mrs Jefferis. He and counsel for Spathis cross-examined the next witness, Mr Groves, briefly. Neither cross-examined the following witness, Mrs Groves. She was followed by her son, Mr A D A Groves, whom Mr MacGregor cross-examined briefly. Detective Hill gave evidence in chief. Mr Jackson gave evidence without being cross-examined by either defence counsel. 
        
       
     35 On Thursday 15 July 1999, the eleventh day, various short witnesses gave evidence, some being cross-examined by Mr MacGregor. Patsalis’ record of interview was then played. 
      
       
     36 On Friday 16 July 1999, the twelfth day, this process continued. A video of Patsalis and Detective Hull visiting various locations on 13 April 1996 was then played. Certain documents were tendered. Mr MacGregor cross-examined Detective Hull about his movements with Patsalis on 12 and 13 April 1996. Mr MacGregor showed no difficulty in questioning him, and no lack of familiarity with the areas he questioned him about. Counsel for Spathis then cross-examined Detective Hull. Detective Kelly began his evidence in chief.  
      
       
     37 On Monday 19 July 1999, the thirteenth day, Detective Kelly continued his evidence in chief. Mr MacGregor cross-examined him about Patsalis’ arrival at the police station on the evening of 12 April 1996. Detective McGillicuddy then gave evidence in chief about events at the police station on 12 April 1996. Mr MacGregor cross-examined him briefly. Detective Sergeant Jacob then gave evidence in chief about his observations of the victim and materials found on and near the victim, and about the arrest of Spathis. Spathis’ record of interview was played.  
      
       
     38 On Tuesday 20 July 1999, the fourteenth day, Mr MacGregor was absent at the outset for a medical reason. In his absence, the playing of Spathis’ record of interview continued to its conclusion. On Mr MacGregor’s arrival, Detective Sergeant Jacob continued his evidence in chief. Mr MacGregor then cross-examined him at some length, in part on relevant locations, with which Mr MacGregor showed familiarity. Counsel for Spathis then cross-examined Detective Sergeant Jacob, and he was re-examined. Some short witnesses followed: Detective Hull, Ms Penny and Mr Greentree. The last two were cross-examined briefly by both defence counsel. Detective Fitzgibbins then commenced his evidence in chief.  
      
       
     39 On Wednesday 21 July 1999, the fifteenth day, Mr MacGregor cross-examined Detective Fitzgibbins. In part this dealt with relevant locations, and showed Mr MacGregor’s familiarity with them. The same is true of his cross-examination of the next witnesses, Detective Locke, Detective Young, Ms Hamilton, Detective Langford and Detective Kehoe. The day concluded with evidence in chief from Detective Gibbs. In the course of that day the following exchange, on which Patsalis now relies, took place: 
      
       
        
         
         “MACGREGOR: My learned friend tendered some tracksuit trousers. At the time I was conscious of some material in my client’s record of interview but, as I understand it, there is no evidence linking the tracksuit trousers found at Mr Spathis’ home with the tracksuit trousers referred to in my client’s record of interview and indeed, as I understand it, I have just been informed that in Mr Spathis’ record of interview he says he disposed of those tracksuit trousers aliunde. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: I must say I was somewhat puzzled by the evidence for a number of reasons. (1) Mr Spathis says in relation to the trousers he was wearing he put them in the bin at work. In relation to Mr Patsalis, the jeans went into the truck, and in relation to the substitute trousers, they were said to be put in a bin at Earlwood, so that these blue trousers may have nothing to do with anything, where they lead I’m not quite sure. 
          
          
         MAGREGOR: They don’t constitute in my submission evidence against my client. It took my client to point that out to me and he’s entirely right. I didn’t have the grasp of the evidence that your Honour had but under s 161, contrary to my client’s interests, but I do object to the tender against my client and I understand my friend is prepared to withdraw it.” 
          
          
         
        
       
     40 On Thursday 22 July 1999, the sixteenth day, the jury was not present for some time while a voir dire was conducted and counsel addressed. When the jury returned Constable Wood gave evidence about his investigation of the burnt vehicle; Mr MacGregor cross-examined him. Mr Gould, who extinguished the fire on 12 April 1996, then gave evidence. The jury then left. On their return, they heard evidence from Ms Taylor, Mr Youlten, Mr Zografos and Detective Kendall. A voir dire examination of Mr Clugston then commenced. After Mr MacGregor’s cross-examination of Mr Clugston on that voir dire, Mr MacGregor said: “That is the point I wanted to make your Honour, and I needed the assistance of my client to do it”.  
      
       
     41 On Friday 23 July 1999, the seventeenth day of the trial, the following events happened. Mr MacGregor announced at the outset that his instructions had been withdrawn. He sought and obtained leave to withdraw. Patsalis had not withdrawn his instructions from his solicitors. At this stage the trial judge had been told that the Crown case was within one week of finishing. Patsalis said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I am going to have to weigh all my options up. It was a decision that I have been thinking about for two weeks since the beginning of this trial and I made the decision late last night.” 
          
         
        
       
       
       Patsalis then expressed a desire to explain his position by reading from a prepared statement, but the trial judge said it was better to wait until the following Tuesday after he had taken legal advice.  
        
       
     42 On Tuesday 27 July 1999, the eighteenth day, Mr Coustas, who was a principal of the firm of solicitors retained by Patsalis, said that new counsel could be obtained for the following Monday. He then said:  
      
       
        
         
         “However, in discussing the matter with my client, my client is of the opinion that would not be appropriate to his case, that it would be insufficient time for a person to be made fully aware of the full – all of the matters contained in the brief, and on that basis he believes he will be in no better position than the situation he was in with his former counsel.” 
          
         
        
       
       
       Mr Coustas said that he had been invited by Patsalis to conduct the defence, but said he felt he had neither the ability nor the time to do so and had only accepted instructions on the basis that counsel would be briefed. The trial judge gave him leave to withdraw. Patsalis then began reading notes to the Court. He said he would undertake his own defence. He referred to the retaining of fresh counsel and said: 
        
         
         “But that would place me in the same predicament I was in previously, that being, counsel not being prepared in relation to the facts of the matter. For every statement contained within the brief, no matter what its substance is, is important to varying degrees in relation to the proceedings in my case. If I was to obtain new counsel then I believe I would be worse off. Therefore, having taken into consideration what his Honour told me on Friday, I have no other option but to undertake my defence.” 
          
         
        
       After Patsalis raised various issues about the future progress of the matter, the trial judge urged him to seek fresh counsel, and said picking up the brief would not be a substantial burden for experienced counsel. Patsalis said: 
        
         
         “I, I’d like to elaborate on what your Honour has said to me because I think it’s very important that you do realise that, and I do not wish to degrade anyone in this matter, your Honour stated earlier than an experienced counsel should be able to pick up a brief such as this being two folders, as your Honour stated, and see the relevance in relation to the statements that are contained in there. Now it amazed me, this is my perception, that how quickly you picked up the material yourself. That means your reading the brief. 
          
          
         In my view, and you may have become aware or may not, I’m sitting here in the dock and I’m passing instructions to my counsel to explain issues in relation to witnesses. I would spend – I would leave the court and I would go home and I would write instructions in relation to the witnesses that would arrive the next day and pass them on to my counsel. Now obviously there was – it’s very hard for me to understand.” 
          
         
        
       After the trial judge, Crown counsel and counsel for Spathis stated the desirability in Patsalis’ interests of being represented by counsel, a short adjournment was granted. Mr Coustas then sought leave to represent Patsalis again, said he expected counsel to be ready by Friday, and asked for an adjournment until Monday 2 August 1999. The trial judge granted that application.  
        
       
     43 On Monday 2 August 1999, the nineteenth day, Mr Amor-Smith, a junior counsel of fourteen years’ standing, announced his appearance for Patsalis. He applied for the matter to be adjourned for a week, or alternatively two or three days, to enable him to prepare the case. The trial judge granted an adjournment for the balance of that day only. While making that adjournment application Mr Amor-Smith said: 
      
       
        
         
         “At about approximately 4.30 last Friday afternoon I received formal instructions to appear in this matter for Mr Patsalis. I had a lengthy conference from 4.30 until about 9pm. The next morning I received certain papers. I have read certain papers. 
          
          
         The totality of the brief in mass is about 60 centimetres or about 2 feet. I have read very little of that. I have been supplied with three video recordings which I haven’t seen. As I understand it they relate to records of interview and a cook’s tour of the locus in quo. There are transcripts of various days which I have seen in a bundle but haven’t read.” 
          
         
        
       
       
       The trial judge said: 
        
         
         “The jury was not summoned until certain preliminary issues were dealt with. They occupied substantially the first two weeks of the time allocated for the trial. Having been disposed of it was everyone’s hope that the thing would run more or less continuously, and it substantially has. There have been the usual interruptions, but by and large it has proceeded relatively smoothly until this particular problem arose. Since then of course the jury on Friday week ago was sent away until Wednesday and was thereafter notified on the Wednesday not to return until today. It was certainly my hope and intention that the matter would proceed today, though I had had signalled to me that because of the particular dilemma of another counsel who preceded you it may be necessary to put the matter over until tomorrow. 
          
          
         I have to say that beyond that, especially having regard to the fact that there has been a weekend intervening, and I would hope and have expected that some substantial part of that may have been devoted to reading the material, that the matter would proceed, if not today then certainly tomorrow. I sympathise with the problem, but a lot of the material, as I say, has been dealt with by way of preliminary issue and has been disposed of so that what remains I don’t think is within a very broad compass. It is certainly within two lever arch folders so far as the Crown brief is concerned, and even that as I understand it has been pared down quite considerably through jettisoning certain witnesses no longer thought to be essential. What remains is therefore simply the proving of the various circumstances which themselves necessitate a variety of particular witnesses but nothing, one would imagine, that would take a great deal of time to master or to deal with.” 
          
         
        
       The trial judge then said that the Crown would initially be calling witnesses relating specifically to Spathis, not Patsalis. Crown counsel said those  
        
       Spathis witnesses would take one to one and a half days. After the adjournment application was disposed of, there were some further procedural debates. 
        
       
     44 On Tuesday 3 August 1999, the twentieth day, the evidence of Mr Lajkowski and Mr Eldridge, which was said to be tendered only against Spathis, was taken. The following testimony against both accused was then received: that of Mr Ghobrial, Constable Wells, Mr Gentles and Mr Najjar. There was then debate about the admissibility of parts of the anticipated testimony of Mr Stratikopoulos, on which the trial judge ruled. Mr Stratikopoulos then gave his evidence. Spathis’ wife (Elizabeth Spathis, nee Figueira) then gave evidence. 
      
       
     45 On Wednesday 4 August 1999, the twenty-first day, proceedings opened with a debate about an inspection of a truck similar to that used on the night of the crime and a debate about whether an order under s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 should be made in relation to Mrs Spathis. The trial judge refused the latter application. The inspection then took place. Mr Millard, who hired the truck to the victim, then gave evidence. Mrs Spathis’ evidence then resumed. It was interrupted, pending a further s 38 application, by the evidence of Mr Harrison and Mr Clugston.  
      
       
     46 On Thursday 5 August 1999, the twenty-second day, there was a debate on the further s 38 application. In the course of that debate the Crown relied on certain inconsistencies to which Mr Amor-Smith had drawn attention in his cross-examination of Mrs Spathis. The Crown said: 
      
       
        
         
         “while certain matters were put to Mrs Spathis yesterday afternoon by Mr Amor-Smith – and of course he did ask her to read through those sections of the statement which I was addressing your Honour about yesterday when this argument was dealt with in the morning – there was no specific detailed cross-examination about those inconsistencies and it might well be that my learned friend chose to take that course for a deliberate reason. … 
          
          
         It might well be that my learned friend Mr Amor-Smith chose to adopt that course for a deliberate reason, which as I say he is entitled to adopt. But it would be the Crown’s submission that the Crown could take it further.” 
          
         
        
       
       
       The transcript thereafter records the following: 
        
         
         “HIS HONOUR: I must say I was not sure having re-read the cross-examination of Mr Amor-Smith whether it was proposed to suggest, for instance, in the final address that by reason of the differences between the statement as originally given and the evidence as given that Mrs Spathis was not to be believed or was in some way motivated by some desire to assist her husband. If that was the purpose then that wasn’t put. 
          
          
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, your Honour, and my view would be that the Crown might well want to put that, as you can well appreciate, and he is somewhat restrained because it wasn’t put to suggest, as I certainly am entitled to, that she has embellished her evidence in some way, she has added to it considerably and that in actual fact – and I will be entitled to put this – it is not in accordance with what she originally recalled, that she has added to it to help her husband. I don’t have a foundation for putting that in the sense it hasn’t been put to the witness. Technically I think I am precluded from doing that. I suppose I could qualify that by saying there is a more liberal interpretation taken by Browne v Dunn than possibly was traditionally thought and certainly it is not always felt that specific things have to be put to a witness. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: So long as the witness is challenged. 
          
          
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, and it could be open to suggest that commonsense would lead one to suggest she could be a biased witness being married to the accused. I do not think that would necessarily have to be put, it would be open to the jury to infer that. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: Perhaps I should enquire of Mr Amor-Smith, is it proposed or was it proposed to ultimately make a submission along those lines? 
          
          
         AMOR-SMITH: No, I was more concerned to let the jury see the comparison of the two versions of what could be called the truth. For logistical reasons I was mindful of the calibre and the age group of the jury, the differences -- 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: I am not really asking to you justify it, I am simply asking you to understand, you are not proposing as I rather gather the Crown is proposing that to put to the jury that the version given to this court on oath by Mrs Spathis should not be believed because she is motivated by a desire to assist her husband? 
          
          
         AMOR-SMITH: In my submission that could be an argument that I will advance. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: I don’t think you have put it. 
          
          
         AMOR-SMITH: I am going to reserve my position.” 
          
         
        
       Somewhat later the trial judge referred to Mr Amor-Smith’s having “reserved his position – whether he is entitled to do so or not is another matter … .” Yet later the transcript records the following: 
        
         
         “HIS HONOUR: … Another aspect that concerns me is this, if Mr Amor-Smith does seek to reserve his position in respect of putting to Mrs Spathis that she is giving untruthful evidence or to put it at its lowest she is colouring her account in order to assist her husband then it seems to me that should have been put and put directly. 
          
          
         CAMPBELL: In my respectful submission it is akin to a cross-examiner in a sexual assault trial failing to put to a complainant, ‘I suggest to you that your motivation of your evidence because of some ill will towards the accused by reason of an unhappy family lawsuit’ if you don’t put it you can’t make the submission. You have got to do it when the witness is there. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: I think the position is as you stated, it has to be put if it is going to be ultimately submitted. I therefore am concerned that Mr Amor-Smith if he wishes to put that this would necessitate leave and no doubt you would say something about it, but he should seek leave to put that question. 
          
          
         CAMPBELL: It also has forensic consequences. He has made a forensic choice at this point because he knows that if he does make an assertion of that kind and s 108 is invoked or may be invoked. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: It may have consequences. 
          
          
         CAMPBELL: And he may have taken the view, I don’t know, I haven’t spoken to him, he may have taken the view that he does not wish to run the gauntlet, as it were, of additional evidence being led to re-establish the credibility of the witness. For example, if I could use just a very simple example, it may be if someone does that I could [lead] evidence from another person to whom she spoke very shortly after the so called representation because s 108 and 66 seem to permit that. It is no easy matter and he for no doubt good reason chose not to introduce the question of motive or bias or recent invention or fabrication or anything of that description.” 
          
         
        
       The trial judge granted the s 38 application on three issues. After Mrs Spathis’ evidence concluded, evidence was called from Miss Hall, Mr Walburn, Miss Croxson, Mr Rohlfs, Mr Weigner, Mr Heyn, Detective Fam and Detective Sergeant Olen. 
        
       
     47 On Friday 6 August 1999, the twenty-third day, little useful was achieved since one juror was absent through illness. The same is true of Monday 9 August 1999, the twenty-fourth day, because two further jurors were ill. The matter was adjourned to 11 August 1999. On Wednesday 11 August 1999, the twenty-fifth day, after some debate in the absence of the jury, one juror was discharged. Mrs Hamilton was recalled. Evidence was taken from Miss Rodwell, Mr John Spathis, Mr Walter, Mr Ashworth and Detective Senior Constable Gibbs.  
      
       
     48 On Thursday 12 August 1999, the twenty-sixth day, the trial judge said that the jury had requested a copy of the transcript of Mr John Spathis’ evidence and of the original of a letter from the victim held by Mr Rohlfs. The former request was acceded to and the second deferred. Evidence was then taken from Detective Senior Constable Gibbs, Mr Manovski, Detective Senior Sergeant Forbes, Mr Haniotis, Mr Anastasios Spathis (Spathis’ father), Mr Grisdale, Senior Sergent Mesker, Mr Wilson and Mrs Moffatt.  
      
       
     49 On Friday 13 August 1999, the twenty-seventh day, Dr Lawrence gave evidence. A statement of Mr Redfearn, and his evidence at the committal hearing, were read. Procedural questions were discussed.  
      
       
     50 On Monday 16 August 1999, the twenty-eighth day, one juror was absent through illness. Patsalis personally presented submissions in support of an application, which he advised Mr Amor-Smith that morning he desired to have made, to conduct a voir dire in relation to Exhibit G and motor vehicle POZ 344. Patsalis was given leave to give sworn evidence in support of that application. The trial judge declined to alter his ruling on Exhibit G, and ordered Mr and Mrs Jefferis to be recalled to be further cross-examined on behalf of Patsalis in relation to POZ 344. 
      
       
     51 On Tuesday 17 August 1999, the twenty-ninth day, the Crown announced that Mr Amor-Smith had informed him that Patsalis did not now require the recall of Mr and Mrs Jefferis. The Crown case was closed. Patsalis began his evidence in chief.  
      
       
     52 On Wednesday 18 August 1999, the thirtieth day, Mr Amor-Smith announced that though Patsalis had suffered severe chest pains overnight he wished to proceed. Patsalis continued his evidence in chief. Near the end of it he gave the following evidence: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. In relation to the record of interview that was conducted via the video system, have you had time to reflect on that record of interview? 
          
          
         A. I have had three, three years and a bit to reflect on that. 
          
          
         Q. Is there anything in that record of interview which you now wish to amend? 
          
          
         A. There was a lot of mistakes which I did make, but – a lot. 
          
          
         Q. You made some, you say a lot of mistakes? 
          
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. Are you able to identify those mistakes? 
          
          
         A. Not without having my transcript in front of me, you know. 
          
          
         Q.. Are there some highlights that you can identify? 
          
          
         A. Yes, definitely. 
          
          
         Q. What are those highlights? 
          
          
         A. The major point would have to be – because of my, as I said, because of my state of mind at that time I made a lot of errors – the one major one that has always bothered me was when I mentioned that Alex Spathis was standing next to us in relation to when Peter was talking about precaution. Now that didn’t occur, the first – if you look at page 39 of my record of interview and then you go back to when I talk about the precaution I make mention of us being in the truck at first when I actually start talking about the precaution which was correct, that was a correct version. The correct start of it. And later on on the following page I make mention that he was standing next to us and I even in my record of interview I recall that even said standing next to me – and I’m not saying this because that has – it’s because of what I now know, I’ve always known it all along, it’s just that at that time I could not express myself and even now I still feel I don’t express myself as I should. Because – but back then it was much worse than what it is today. I was under great – I was suffering from shock and that was the reason for me drafting up these notes, because I wanted to say the whole truth in relation to this matter and that is why I even incorporated – I went back in time and mentioned my debts to Mr Spathis in – and how it all coincided. Now I wanted to be truthful in every aspect, my intentions, I knew that I had to – I had to – when I went to the police I had to tell them the whole truth in relation to all of the matters and all the matters included my debt to him and because that had bearing on how everything came into being, if I can use that term. And my state of mind at that time and that is why I tried all along throughout the following day and that was when I went to the Hilton Hotel and when I went and bought this notebook was so that I could put it all down in writing and not speak it. 
          
          
         Q. Was there another reason why you went to the Hilton Hotel, besides writing your notes? 
          
          
         A. Yes, because I didn’t have a place to stay because there was no way I was going back to 1 Arthur Street, Homebush, because I didn’t know if Mr Spathis was going to return or not or what was going to occur in relation to him because he had always made threats to me and now from my point of view I’ve just witnessed him kill somebody. I was the only witness to that killing. He did not know what I knew in relation to the precaution and that I was Peter’s security. Now for me I could have – and I knew when I gave him – it goes back to the 6th of the 4th of 1996 when I gave Peter my licence details. I knew that I could not in any way, shape or form hurt him or do anything to him because he, if I can use the term, had something on me. And if anything was to happen to him it was all going to come back into my direction.” 
          
         
        
       
       
       The trial judge warned the jury that having Patsalis’ evidence in chief, and knowing that Spathis’ record of interview contradicted it, it was important for them to keep an open mind. 
        
       
     53 On Thursday 19 August 1999, the thirty-first day, Mr Amor-Smith informed the court that Patsalis was still suffering ill health. After the procedural consequences of that and other difficulties were discussed, the trial judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “HIS HONOUR: The question was not asked in terms: Is everything you said in the record of interview true? It is clear, the implication of the questions put, namely, the invitation to correct anything which was not accurate, so that Mr Patsalis’ interview is now evidence, generally, available.  
          
          
         CAMPBELL: Subject to matters I will come to later. He has not expressed its veracity on oath. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: I don’t know whether that was an oversight on the part of Mr Amor-Smith or whether that was quite deliberate. 
          
          
         AMOR-SMITH: I thought the video record of interview had gone into evidence some time ago. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: It has. You did not put to him, specifically, is everything you said to the police before you were interviewed and after you were interviewed true; is there anything you want to withdraw or modify? 
          
          
         AMOR-SMITH: As I understand it, I asked him questions referable to the record of interview, is there anything you wish to change? He said there were things there but he would have to look at his record of interview. I then said, any specific you wish to raise at this time? He then said, one issue referable to a particular matter. Otherwise, if we were to go through that procedure, it could take half day or so, and if that is required, I, certainly, will do it. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: What I had anticipated you would do is to put a question along the lines I have just put, is everything you said to the police both before your interview and during the course of your interview true? One would anticipate that he would say, yes. However, there were some inaccuracies that came into the interview of which these are the important ones. One he mentioned. If there are any other important ones, I would have thought that it was fairly important that he also mention them. I just want to be clear in my own mind as to how it is put, so that I can, ultimately, tell the jury whether or not this is evidence which is available, generally, in the case against both accused which, if it is incorporated, as I would understand the position it would be, if it is incorporated by reference that what I said then, I now say that everything I said was true, although I was inaccurate in this or that respect, it then becomes evidence, generally; is that not right? 
          
          
         AMOR-SMITH: Yes. That be the situation, I may have to seek your Honour’s leave to adduce further evidence in relation to that area. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: It is your case. All I am seeking is clarification. 
          
          
         AMOR-SMITH: I made an assumption, perhaps I was wrong, that the record of interview had gone in. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: It has, but it is at the moment only in your client’s case. 
          
          
         AMOR-SMITH: I would want to put further questions in that area. I seek instructions in the matter of inconsistencies and if there are, where they are. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: This is not an invitation to down tools to comb through the record of interview. I thought you would have been in a position to say at once, leaving aside minor slips of the tongue, but to say these matters on the evening for whatever reason I got wrong and now I want to correct. You have corrected one. If there are others, it seems to me it should be corrected.” 
          
         
        
       
       
       Mr Amor-Smith successfully applied to call further evidence in chief. Part of it was: 
        
         
         “Q. Yesterday I was asking you some questions about your record of interview, do you recall that? 
          
          
         A. Yes, I do. 
          
          
         Q. As I understand it you subsequently received a hard copy of that record of interview, do you recall that? 
          
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. I show you a folder, would you open that black folder and what is contained within that black folder? 
          
          
         A. The record of interview that I gave on the 12th of the 4th 1996. 
          
          
         Q. Is everything that you said in that record of interview to the police before, during and after the record of interview true and correct? 
          
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. True and correct? 
          
          
         A. What is contained in here? 
          
          
         Q. Yes? 
          
          
         A. Except for the mistakes that I mentioned yesterday that I had made. 
          
          
         Q. As I recall your evidence you said that there were some mistakes or some things that you would like to fix up in that record of interview, is that correct? 
          
          
         A. Well, I fixed up the mistake in relation to the precaution and how it was only told to me and not in the presence of Mr Spathis. 
          
          
         Q. Are there any other matters contained within that record of interview, the hard copy that you have got in front of you, which you now wish to amend, change and/or alter? 
          
          
         A. Not only that I can really think of at this time, no. 
          
          
         Q. So other than the matters that you amended and/or altered and/or changed yesterday everything that you say in that record of interview during, before and after the record of interview is true and correct, is that what you say? 
          
          
         A. To the best of my recollection, yes.” 
          
         
        
       The trial judge delivered a judgment permitting certain categories of cross-examination concerning Patsalis’ character. The cross-examination of Patsalis began. 
        
       
     54 On Friday 20 August 1999, the thirty-second day, Patsalis’ cross-examination by the Crown continued. The brief evidence of Patsalis’ sister, Betty Patsalis, was then interposed. Mr Amor-Smith was then given leave to ask further questions in chief about Exhibit 8P. The Crown cross-examination then resumed. 
      
       
     55 On Monday 23 August 1999, the thirty-third day, Patsalis’ cross-examination by the Crown concluded. His cross-examination by counsel for Spathis then commenced. 
      
       
     56 On Tuesday 24 August 1999, the thirty-fourth day, Patsalis’ cross-examination by counsel for Spathis continued. 
      
       
     57 On Wednesday 25 August 1999, the thirty-fifth day, Patsalis’ cross-examination by counsel for Spathis finished and re-examination started. 
      
       
     58 On Thursday 26 August 1999, the thirty-sixth day, Mr Amor-Smith applied for and obtained an order for a view of Bankstown Square. Mr Andrew Patsalis, Patsalis’ brother, gave evidence.  
      
       
     59 On Friday 27 August 1999, the thirty-seventh day, Mr Amor-Smith applied unsuccessfully for an extended view. Debate about procedural issues and jury directions took place. 
      
       
     60 On Tuesday 31 August 1999, the thirty-eighth day, a juror was discharged and the view took place. 
      
       
     61 On Wednesday 1 September 1999, the thirty-ninth day, argument took place on an application made by Mr Amor-Smith on Patsalis’ instructions that Exhibit AG (a jacket allegedly worn by Spathis during the crime and found in his house) should be excluded. The trial judge concluded that it should not be. Detective Sergeant Jacob gave some evidence about photographs. Patsalis was recalled to deal with a plan relating to access to Bankstown Shopping Mall in relation to which Spathis’ legal advisers had made an error. The Crown then re-opened its case to recall Mr John Spathis to enable further cross-examination by Mr Amor-Smith to be conducted without objection from Spathis. The case for Patsalis was then closed. Debate then ensued in which the following was said: 
      
       
        
         
         “CAMPBELL: “I take it at the end of the day your Honour will give the jury some kind of direction along the lines of Mr John Spathis was recalled because there was an oversight which was corrected. The normal principle is that somebody has an opportunity to contradict an assertion, a Browne v Dunn type principle. The jury asked for the transcript of his earlier evidence, they obviously were concerned about his evidence regarding it as of importance. We would see it as important that they understand the forensic reason why he was brought back when he was and the way in which he was and why other witnesses have not. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: As I say, at some point I am going to invite each of you to catalogue all the warnings and directions that you believe I ought to include somewhere or other. I will certainly make a note that that is one matter that you specifically have drawn to my attention. 
          
          
         CAMPBELL: It is not just the one that has been brought back, it is the ones that haven’t as well in our submission.” 
          
         
        
       
       
       Counsel for Spathis then opened his case and Spathis began to give evidence in chief.  
        
       
     62 On Thursday 2 September 1999, the fourtieth day, while the Court waited for a late juror, the following debate took place: 
      
       
        
         
         “HIS HONOUR: Mr Campbell, if I could just address something to you. Following your remark about Mr John Spathis, I was looking at the sort of Browne v Dunn type point, and the directions that are given in that context, and I haven’t got beyond, I have to say, looking at the convenient summary which appears in criminal directions. There are a number of things for instance that it is perhaps surprising that questions were not asked of various witnesses, and that might apply to you as much as – not perhaps as much as, but some degree as it does to Mr Patsalis. And one could understand good forensic reasons for this, but nonetheless I’m looking at the viewpoint of the jury, Mr Amor-Smith chose not to open up the issue of the exclusion from The Three Swallows Hotel with his brother, nor threats against his brother. Nor did you. Now, who would ordinarily be expected to take that up? I can understand you not going into it when he does not. 
          
          
         CAMPBELL: That is the decision I took.  
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: It is a tactical decision in some respects, and from the viewpoint of the jury, if I were to give a direction, it would have to be a fairly wishy-washy sort of summary; on the one hand this, on the one hand that, and it’s a question for you, you know, and I am not sure that it is appropriate in that context at all, so that I think you will need to define very precisely in the areas where you say there has been some default. That is the first thing. 
          
          
         The second thing is I do think it is the fact that it has been said repeatedly by Mr Patsalis that there was a difficulty in his case, and it was evidence that there was the change of counsel, and in the nature of things Mr Amor-Smith had a large task in taking up what was then already a fair mass of paper, whatever I might have said at the time, and I do not resile from that. It was fundamentally two folders, but it is to get the flavour and the feel of a case, when you come into it partway through I think is not easy.  
          
          
         CAMPBELL: Of course in any case people do miss things.” 
          
         
        
       
       
       After other procedural debate, Spathis’ examination in chief continued until the luncheon adjournment. On resumption, Mr Amor-Smith said: 
        
         
         “AMOR-SMITH: As your Honour will recall and appreciate Mr Patsalis has substantially prepared his own case. He has now informed me that he has prepared his cross-examination of Mr Spathis and he has prepared his closing address for the jury. He has worked for the last six weeks preparing those two aspects, that is the cross-examination and the closing address. 
          
          
         He has now given formal instructions to my instructing solicitor my instructing solicitor’s instructions are to be withdrawn at 3.30pm, 2 September 1999. On that basis my instructing solicitor has advised me that as their instructions are withdrawn my instructions will also be withdrawn. 
          
          
         The situation came about this way, the indication was that I would be at some stage cross-examining Mr Spathis. Mr Patsalis advised me last Tuesday, or was it Monday, that he was preparing a thousand page question and answer for me and that I was to contract with him rigorously to ask those questions and only those questions and I was not to divert from his thousand page question and answer transcript. I advised him that that would be an impossibility and I could not contract, nor could I give an undertaking that I would ask any or all of those questions. 
          
          
         I indicated to him that I have prepared my cross-examination which consists of approximately 98 points but I haven’t got a question and answer format because my questions and answers would vary according to the questions and answers as the case proceeded. Mr Patsalis has considered that aspect and just prior, 1.55 this afternoon, the question was posed, ‘Will you or will you not be cross-examining yourself?’ It was agreed that Mr Patsalis would complete the rest of the case on his own initiative. On that basis at 3.30 this afternoon, subject to your Honour’s leave, I propose to withdraw from the proceedings as do my instructing solicitors.” 
          
         
        
       Soon afterwards Spathis’ evidence in chief concluded and the Crown’s cross-examination began. 
        
       
     63 The course of proceedings thereafter can be summarised more briefly. On Monday 6 September 1999, the forty-first day, the Crown’s cross-examination of Spathis finished. Patsalis’ cross-examination of Spathis started. It continued on Tuesday 7 September 1999, Wednesday 8 September 1999, Thursday 9 September 1999 and Wednesday 15 September 1999. Re-examination of Spathis concluded on that day. The Crown address began and concluded on that day. On 16 September 1999 counsel for Spathis addressed the jury, and Patsalis addressed the jury. On 17 September 1999 Patsalis was unfit. On 20 September 1999 he finished his address. On 21, 22 and 23 September 1999 the trial judge summed up. On 23 September 1999 the jury retired. On 24 September 1999 they convicted each accused of murder. 
      
       
        
         
        
       
       
        
       Some general submissions of Patsalis 
       
     64 There are some general submissions advanced by Patsalis that should be considered first.  
      
       
     65 Patsalis submitted that he had been forced into direct participation in the trial because there was no junior and Mr Ho’s English was inadequate, and because “counsel was impeded by not having a junior or solicitor competent enough to point out various inconsistencies”. There is no evidence that Mr Ho’s English was inadequate: Mr MacGregor described it only as creating “a little bit of a problem”. Nor is there any evidence that Mr Ho was incompetent. It is true that Mr MacGregor had no junior, but no other counsel at the trial had a junior either, and innumerable serious criminal trials, including murder trials, are conducted by barristers who have no juniors. These factors do not support the view that there was any miscarriage of justice.  
      
       
     66 Patsalis submitted that if Mr MacGregor lacked time to prepare, he should have sought an adjournment. Despite the manner in which the trial judge was solicitous, almost to a fault, for the interests of the accused and in particular Patsalis, it is highly unlikely that that application would have been granted. In any event the delays in the first two weeks of the trial amounted in substance to an adjournment.  
      
       
     67 Patsalis drew attention to Mr MacGregor’s statements on 2 July 1999 to the effect that he had not yet read the whole brief, that he had not yet received instructions about Exhibit G, and that he was under time pressure. He submitted that it followed that Mr MacGregor had behaved with flagrant incompetence. That submission is rejected. Mr MacGregor would only have behaved incompetently if he had not used all reasonable endeavours in the time available to master what materials he had. The evidence does not show that he had not mastered them. It does show that he had put significant effort into dealing with the particular tasks that had arisen in the first week. He objected to a significant quantity of Patsalis’ record of interview. His argument on the first and second days in support of the application for separate trials was vigorous and impressive. He revealed familiarity with the contents of both records of interview. He had protested with appropriate force about various difficulties he was facing, such as transcript difficulties. To some extent those of his assertions from which Patsalis sought to infer unpreparedness can be read as the somewhat exaggerated claims of an advocate seeking to achieve a particular forensic purpose. The jury was not empanelled, the indictment was not presented, and the accused did not plead until Monday 5 July 1999. That empanelling miscarried. The indictment was not presented a second time, the accused did not plead and the jury which heard the trial was not empanelled until Tuesday 6 July 1999. Various voir dires and other procedural activities took place in the absence of the jury until 12 July 1999, the eighth day: not until then did the Crown and counsel for the accused open. The first witness before the jury was not called until 13 July 1999, the ninth day.  
      
       
     68 The point is that even if Mr MacGregor felt he was less than fully prepared on 2 July, the rather stuttering progress of events over the succeeding days gave him ample opportunities to become more fully prepared in the next ten days, and in particular before any evidence was called before the jury. 
      
       
     69 A particular submission about Mr MacGregor’s conduct on 2 July 1999 related to the warnings given before the production of Exhibit G. Patsalis submitted that if Mr MacGregor had read the brief, he would have seen the statements of Detective McGillicuddy, Constable Kelly and Constable Agnew, which described the warnings. That misses Mr MacGregor’s point which was that he wanted to “ascertain from my client precisely the circumstances of what warnings he was given” – not from the police officers. In any event by Monday 5 July 1999 Mr MacGregor had examined the police statements. 
      
       
     70 Patsalis submitted that the observation by Mr MacGregor on Tuesday 6 July 1999 “I have no instructions to this effect” showed that Mr MacGregor’s promise on 2 July 1999 to obtain instructions about Exhibit G had not yet been fulfilled. Patsalis submitted that this conduct “is not professional, nor is it honest or in the interests of” his case. However, the submission rests on a misunderstanding of what Mr MacGregor was doing. He was engaged in a hypothetical debate with the trial judge. He was not saying that he had not sought instructions; merely that his instructions did not correspond with the hypothetical example he gave.  
      
       
     71 Mr MacGregor was criticised for relying on a Crown assurance that the police documents he wanted in connection with Exhibit G were being produced, because it was naïve to expect police officers in trouble to produce evidence adverse to them. If this unjustified attack on the officers were sound, of course, they could have made a selective response to any subpoena as well. Mr MacGregor was not incompetent in relying on Crown counsel.  
      
       
       
       Defence tactics: general 
       
     72 In relation to what Patsalis called “subpoenas, certificates of expert evidence and the summonsing of independent parties”, he submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “The absence of notice relating to the production of certificates of expert evidence, and the summonsing of independent parties left various critical matters unresolved, unchallenged and open to speculation. Such critical matters, it is respectfully submitted, gave an unfair advantage to a party who lies by and belatedly produces a version tailored to meet the evidence. 
          
          
         Whilst various subpoenas were issued during the course of the trial, they were filed incorrectly, or very late, or the wrong information was recorded and therefore, when the subpoenas were answered the material was useless. With respect the subpoenas only begin to be filed due to the continued insistence of the appellant, or by the direct participation of the appellant whilst the trial was in progress. 
          
          
         The issues that required investigation were highly predictable and therefore it is respectfully submitted, ought to have been anticipated. The absence of notice is directly relevant.” 
          
         
        
       
       
       So far as this rests on allegations of fact, they are unsupported either by any affidavit or by the transcript. 
        
       
     73 It is now necessary to go to specific instances advanced by Patsalis. 
      
       
        
       Subpoenas 
       
       
       Subpoenas to Spathis 
       
     74 Patsalis submitted that Spathis should have been served with a subpoena for “All work, home and mobile telephone records for the period” 1 January–12 April 1996 in order to demonstrate supposed errors in Spathis’ distancing of himself in his record of interview from the cigarette transaction with the victim, and to achieve other goals of supposed value to Patsalis. For example, Patsalis said that if the records showed a closer association between the victim and Spathis, the jury would infer how clever Spathis was in keeping himself at a distance while leaving Patsalis to do the preparatory work. “It could then be inferred that such a terrible crime was in the mind of only one person. It is consistent with the innocence of one of the men in terms of their joint agreement or joint participation or joint knowledge.”  
      
       
     75 The first problem with this submission is that Spathis would have been highly likely to rely on his privilege against self-incrimination. The second is that Patsalis has not demonstrated that the materials which he submitted Spathis (or Telstra, if a subpoena were directed to it) would produce would in fact be useful. It is wholly speculative whether anything of value would have turned up. 
      
       
       
       Subpoenas to Mr John Spathis 
       
     76 Patsalis submitted that subpoenas should have been served on Spathis’ uncle, Mr John Spathis. The documents sought were telephone records from 1 January–12 April 1996, as well as those permitting an “independent investigation” into Mr John Spathis’ business activities relating to his dealings with his cigarette purchases and sales”. Patsalis submitted:  
      
       
        
         
         “The material could provide a logical nexus between the ERISP and evidence of the appellant with the precautionary letter (Exhibit AX), with the note found in Mr Ludwig’s home (Exhibit 8P), with the statements of Mr Redfern and with the statements of Mr Grisdale. 
          
          
         It is respectfully submitted, that it is naïve, or it would be naïve simply to accept Mr John Spathis’ statement and evidence at face value. The existence of Mr Redfern and Mr Grisdale’s statements, and the Exhibits AX and 8P were critical matters in the defence case.” 
          
         
        
       
       
       In Exhibit AX the victim said, in a note only to be opened after 11pm on 11 April 1996, that Spathis’ uncle was supposedly involved in the cigarette business. Exhibit AP is a typed list of notes made by the victim. The reference to Mr John Spathis’ statement and evidence is a reference to his denials that he knew Patsalis, to his statement that Spathis had never approached him with a proposal to buy or sell cigarettes, and to his statements that he never bought illegal cigarettes. In cross-examination Mr Amor-Smith put to Mr John Spathis, who ran a supermarket which sold cigarettes, that he, Spathis and Patsalis had a conversation in October 1995 at the Three Swallows Hotel in which Patsalis discussed acquiring soft drinks from Mr John Spathis for a charity night being run by Patsalis’ sister at the Bankstown Greek Orthodox Church. Mr John Spathis denied this. Mr Amor-Smith also put to John Spathis that he had seen Patsalis on at least fifteen occasions at the Three Swallows Hotel. Mr John Spathis denied this too. Mr Amor-Smith further put to Mr John Spathis that he and Patsalis had a conversation in late March or early April 1996 about supplying cigarettes to the victim with the involvement of Spathis; and that he and Spathis were to sell cigarettes to the victim through Patsalis as middleman for a commission of $3,500. Mr John Spathis denied this. He also denied any knowledge of the victim. Patsalis submitted that the documents he claimed should have been subpoenaed “may have been able to reveal” that both Mr John Spathis and Spathis were lying and that Patsalis’ account of the transaction was correct. 
        
       
     77 There is no evidence that Patsalis ever gave Mr MacGregor or his instructing solicitors during the time when Mr MacGregor was briefed instructions along the lines of the propositions underlying the questions put to John Spathis by Mr Amor-Smith. Propositions along those lines do not appear in Exhibit G (the handwritten statement Patsalis composed before going to the police) or in his record of interview. Mr MacGregor did not mention them in opening. This casts a grave doubt over those propositions. Nor, even given the furtiveness with which, according to the propositions put by Mr Amor-Smith, Mr John Spathis behaved, is it likely that the telephone records would have corroborated them. 
      
       
     78 Further, subpoenas wide enough to support the “independent investigation” of Mr John Spathis’ business activities would probably have been set aside by the court at the instigation of Mr John Spathis as an abuse of process. It would have been natural for an uncle to advance his nephew’s interests in this way 
      
       
       
       Subpoenas to Metropolitan Security Services and its officers 
       
     79 Metropolitan Security Services was Patsalis’ employer in the period before the victim died. 
      
       
     80 Patsalis submitted that Spathis in his record of interview and his evidence had suggested that Patsalis was out of work and dependent on Spathis for living expenses.  
      
       
     81 Patsalis submitted that Metropolitan Security Services should have been served with a subpoena to produce documents showing, and Mr Harding (Operations Manager) and Miss Jenkens should have been called to say, that Patsalis had been “in stable employment and had a steady income” from 24 November 1994 on, even while he was on workers’ compensation or while placed on light duties.  
      
       
     82 Contrary to what Patsalis told the trial judge on 8 September 1999 (2411 lines 16-20), there is no evidence that he had ever asked his lawyers to serve a subpoena on Metropolitan Security Services. According to what Patsalis told the trial judge on 8 September 1999 (2411 lines 22-45), Metropolitan Security Services had been taken over by Chubb and Mayne Nickless Ltd. On that day the trial judge said he remembered a subpoena addressed to Chubb, which had said there were no documents (352 line 28). That subpoena had been issued by Spathis. On 9 September 1999 counsel for both Spathis and the Crown said they had no records from Patsalis’ employer (2447 lines 44-49). In those circumstances it would seem that any attempt by Patsalis’ legal advisers to pursue Metropolitan Security Services by a subpoena duces tecum would have been futile. 
      
       
     83 There is a sharp contradiction between the reason now advanced for the utility of the subpoena to Metropolitan Security Services and the reason which Patsalis gave the trial judge for the supposed instruction to his solicitors to obtain his 1995–1996 work records. The reason now advanced is that the subpoena could have produced documents discrediting Spathis by showing that Patsalis was in employment. The reason then advanced was that the documents produced would “perhaps” give Patsalis an alibi in relation to some unspecified meetings with Spathis. Inquiries – in which the trial judge arguably went well beyond the call of the Court’s duty to an unrepresented litigant – proceeded with a view to establishing the alibi which Patsalis desired. The Crown’s solicitors had dealings with Mr Harding (2511-2512). The Crown made inquiries of the police (2527 line 55). Patsalis suggested that examination of his pay slips might assist, which the trial judge doubted (2528 lines 26-37). Further dealings between Detective Hull and Ms Williams suggested that Patsalis was not at work for various periods including a crucial period in February 1996. Patsalis then suggested that an examination of Mr Coustas’ workers’ compensation file might be fruitful (2530 lines 4-32). A little later Patsalis said he was deciphering some manuscript records (2535 line 55). Patsalis then said he needed a document which he had at home to prove he was working in January 1996 (2536 lines 19-29). In the next sitting day (Monday 13 September 1999) Patsalis said further difficulties had been caused by the illness of the lady who had promised him all necessary information (2534 line 10–2555 line 13). On the next sitting day (Tuesday 14 September 1999) Patsalis reported that further inquiries of Mayne Nickless had been fruitless (2562–2564).  
      
       
     84 The fact is that the Crown never appears to have alleged that the reason why Patsalis kept asking Spathis for money was a lack of income, and Spathis himself put little stress on that proposition. Spathis’ main point was that Patsalis kept borrowing money to feed a gambling habit. The Crown’s point was that Patsalis’ motive was a need to repay his debts to Spathis, who was putting pressure on Patsalis to repay those debts. Patsalis in fact repeatedly admitted both that he was a heavy and unsuccessful gambler and that he owed Spathis about $16,500. None of these matters could have been affected by proof that Patsalis had been in regular employment.  
      
       
     85 This chain of events suggests that in truth there was no real prospect of obtaining useful records by a subpoena to Metropolitan Security Services; that even if there was, and even if his lawyers failed to get them, the trial judge would have allowed Patsalis himself to issue any relevant subpoena right up to the close of the evidence; that what Patsalis was trying to prove at the trial is different from what he says now that he was trying to prove; that what he says now that he was trying to prove would not have assisted his cause at the trial; and that what he was trying to prove at the trial was so marginal to the very strong case against him that his failure to prove it, whatever the cause, did not produce any miscarriage of justice. 
      
       
       
       Subpoena to Dr Mahony 
       
     86 Patsalis submitted that it would have been useful for him to establish that his acquaintance with the victim was “simply a coincidence” in that the victim had a business of restocking cigarette vending machines, one of which was at 12B Restwell Street, Bankstown, and that Patsalis only went there in order to have minor surgery from Dr Mahony because of a work-related injury.  
      
       
     87 A perusal of this part of Patsalis’ written submissions might suggest that there was no material from Dr Mahony before the jury. In fact both Patsalis and Spathis tendered material from Dr Mahony. It did not support the point which Patsalis now says Dr Mahony’s material would have supported. But Patsalis himself could have subpoenaed any other material; and proof of the fact which Patsalis says he wishes to establish would have made no difference whatever to the case against him.  
      
       
       
       Subpoenas to Mr Clark or Mr Harding 
       
     88 Patsalis submitted that subpoenas to the Metropolitan Security Services Training Officer (Mr Clark) or Operations Officer (Mr Harding) to give evidence would have enabled him to refute Spathis’ suggestion that Patsalis knew of a “Gun Club” at Terry Hills, which Metropolitan Security Services used for training. Patsalis could have issued the subpoenas himself. And it is impossible to see how the evidence in question would have created any chance of acquittal.  
      
       
       
       Failure to call expert evidence 
       
     89 Patsalis submitted that Dr Lawrence, the only forensic pathologist who testified at the trial, was not independent, and that an independent witness should have been called.  
      
       
     90 Patsalis and Spathis each said that the other was sitting in the driver’s seat, i.e. on the victim’s right. Dr Lawrence expressed the view that some of the wounds could have been caused by either knife found at the scene. He also said that three of the wounds on the left hand side of the victim could have been inflicted from the left side, while seven wounds could have been inflicted from the right, as their wound tracks were mostly from right to left. This left it open to the jury to find that two knives were used and that the victim was attacked from both sides, that is, that each accused stabbed the victim. Dr Lawrence said that given the unknown movements of the victim at the time of the stabbing, it would only be speculation to estimate whether they all came from the right or some from the right and some from the left. Dr Lawrence also said that the wounds could have been caused by one knife, two knives, or by many other knives.  
      
       
     91 Patsalis was acting for himself when the time came for the calling of expert evidence in his own case. There is no explanation why, if he found Dr Lawrence’s evidence vulnerable, he did not do so. There is no reason to suppose that it was vulnerable. Patsalis did not point to anything which any witness might have said which would have contradicted Dr Lawrence. That in turn means there was nothing useful which could have been asked of Dr Lawrence which was not asked. Patsalis did not submit that he gave any instruction to Mr Amor-Smith that the latter should ask the questions which Patsalis now contends should have been asked.  
      
       
       
       K-Mart Store subpoena 
       
     92 Patsalis submitted that a subpoena should have been issued to obtain film of the person who bought knives at the K-Mart Store. There is no evidence that appropriate inquiries were not made. There is every possibility that no relevant record had been kept, or that it was indistinct.  
      
       
       
       Subpoena re telephone booth near Patsalis’ house 
       
     93 Patsalis said that his lawyers had failed to subpoena the telephone records relating to the telephone booth near his home to confirm calls made to the victim. In fact there was documentary evidence of a call made at the relevant time from another booth (Exhibit BB), and the jury was entitled to accept it.  
      
       
       
       Subpoena to Commonwealth Bank 
       
     94 Patsalis said he wished to prove that he had procured payment to Spathis of a Commonwealth Bank cheque from a Green Orthodox priest. Since Spathis admitted this, no prejudice was caused by the failure to issue any subpoena. In any event, the point was entirely trivial. 
      
       
       
       Independent report about fire 
       
     95 Patsalis submitted that counsel should have had independent tests conducted “to ascertain the height of the flames when the fire was first lit” and “to ascertain how long the body of [the victim] had been subjected to fire”. Patsalis did not, however, explain how those tests would have helped his case.  
      
       
       
       Failure of counsel to visit relevant scenes 
       
     96 Patsalis submitted, first, that counsel failed to “visit and investigate crime scenes critical to the case” and, secondly, that this led to an inability of counsel to understand the facts.  
      
       
     97 There is no evidence that counsel did not conduct appropriate visits. And even if counsel did not do this, there is nothing to suggest any misunderstanding of the evidence. Mr MacGregor’s cross-examinations of relevant witnesses, in particular, showed adequate familiarity with the scenes. Though criticism was made of Mr Amor-Smith’s cross-examination in relation to the K-Mart Store at Bankstown, that criticism was unconvincing. In any event, issues about the details of particular locations were quite minor.  
      
       
       
       Failure of counsel to object 
        
       Exhibit AA 
       
     98 Exhibit AA consisted of certain tracksuit trousers. Initially they were admitted without objection. This was said by Patsalis to illustrate that so far as Mr MacGregor was concerned “there was next to no preparation done”. Mr MacGregor and the trial judge then discussed the matter on 21 July 1999 in a passage set out above.  
      
       
     99 If counsel erred, it was a harmless error, since the trial judge excluded the evidence (766).  
      
       
     Exhibit AG100 Exhibit AG was a jacket allegedly worn by Spathis on 11 April 1996. It was tendered during the evidence of Detective Gibbs, who said he found it in a search of Spathis’ home. Patsalis has not demonstrated why Exhibit AG was inadmissible or how its reception unfairly prejudiced him.  
      
       
       
       Errors in cross-examination 
        
       Clugston 
       
     101 Patsalis made lengthy criticism of Mr MacGregor’s handling of Mr Clugston the day before Mr MacGregor was dismissed. Patsalis attributed the fact that Mr MacGregor applied to examine Mr Clugston on the voir dire to Mr MacGregor’s lack of preparation. That is not a safe inference, since Mr MacGregor cross-examined Mr Clugston effectively to establish the system administered by Mr Clugston at the Bankstown Sports Club.  
      
       
     102 Patsalis attributed his decision to dismiss Mr MacGregor to Mr MacGregor’s statement that he needed Patsalis’ assistance to get a point made through Mr Clugston. That statement does not establish that Mr MacGregor was incompetent; it was probably only an attempt to change the atmosphere in a manner favourable to Patsalis. And since the cross-examination was on the voir dire, not before the jury, any defects in it cannot have reduced Patsalis’ chances of acquittal.  
      
       
       
       Kehoe and Kendall 
       
     103 Patsalis criticised Mr MacGregor’s cross-examination of Detective Kehoe and his failure to cross-examine Dr Kendall. His submissions, however, do not demonstrate either that Mr MacGregor committed any blunder or, if he did, that it prejudiced Patsalis.  
      
       
       
       Jacob 
       
     104 Patsalis’ criticism of Mr MacGregor’s cross-examination of Detective Sergeant Jacob depends on repeated assertions of Mr MacGregor’s unpreparedness. That proposition of fact has not been demonstrated. Nor, in the absence of evidence from Mr MacGregor, can it be said that he was not pursuing rational tactics. Patsalis also suggested a large number of questions which Mr MacGregor should have asked. Most of them appear to be open to valid objection.  
      
       
       
       Caruso 
       
     105 Patsalis submitted that Caruso should have been cross-examined with a view to revealing that Spathis was more likely to have been standing near the victim’s body at the place where it was found than Patsalis was. It might equally have assisted Spathis by demonstrating that one imprint near the body was made by Mr Caruso, not Spathis. It is hard in any event to see how Patsalis lost any chance of acquittal. The same is true of the suggestion that Mr Caruso should have been asked questions directed to showing that the area was a built-up residential area.  
      
       
       
       Langford and Hull 
       
     106 Patsalis submitted that since counsel for Spathis cross-examined Detective Langford on whether video surveillance cameras existed at the K-Mart Store, while Mr MacGregor did not, the jury could have been left with the impression that Patsalis was sensitive about possible footage.  
      
       
     107 Patsalis also suggested that Detective Langford and Detective Hull should have been questioned about the time of purchases made on 11 April 1996 with a view to negating pre-planning and revealing that Patsalis had a clear conscience.  
      
       
     108 The lack of the questioning which Patsalis submitted ought to have been engaged in does not suggest that Patsalis lost any chance of acquittal.  
      
       
       
       Other mistakes 
       
     109 Patsalis relied on various other supposed errors of Mr MacGregor, and, for example, on occasional statements by Mr MacGregor in the course of conducting questioning to the effect: “I made a mistake, I apologise” (336 line 26). Virtually every cross-examination contains minor “mistakes”. No mistake has been shown to have caused Patsalis to have lost a chance of acquittal.  
      
       
        
       Further evidence: Martinez statement 
       
     110 It is convenient at this point to consider two applications made by Patsalis to rely on further evidence. That evidence provides background to Patsalis’ arguments about both Mr MacGregor and Mr Amor-Smith.  
      
       
     111 Patsalis attempted to tender for the consideration of this Court a statement of Mr Francisco Martinez dated 18 April 1996. He was a Senior Travel Consultant with Jetset Travel, Wynyard. His statement related to his dealings on 11 and 12 April 1996 with a person at that time known as Elizabeth Figueria, who at the time of the trial was Mrs Spathis. In April 1996 they were engaged and living together. His statement said: 
      
       
        
         
         “While at work on Thursday the 11 April, 1996 about 10 or 11 am I received a phone call to check availability of a package over the weekend period of 13 and 14 April, 1996. This call was from a female, giving her name as Elizabeth. She said, ‘I’d like to look into going up to the Gold Coast for two people over the weekend on one of your five night specials’. I said ‘I can check availability of flights, but I’d have to get back to you regarding accommodation’. She said ‘That’s fine, can you get back to me something this afternoon’. I said ‘Yes, can I have your particulars, so if there is anything available I can provisionally book it for you and you can advise me if it’s suitable or not’. She said ‘The names are Elizabeth Figueira and Alex Spathis’. I said ‘Can I have a contact so I can get back to you?’ and she said ‘That’s fine, its 3981230’. I said ‘I’ll get back to you this afternoon’. I then ended the call. 
          
          
         I then made some inquiries and then called Elizabeth about 2 or 3 pm that day. I introduced myself and explained the alternatives that I had listed for her. I specifically remember her asking for the Moroccan Beach Resort. She said ‘Can you look into the Moroccan for me, otherwise I take the Surfers Beachside or The Shrangi La Apartments’. I said ‘I’ll get back to you and you can decide’. The call then ended. 
          
          
         Within half an hour I called her back letting her know that the Moroccan was unavailable. She then confirmed to me that she wanted to go ahead with the Shrangi La Apartments. 
          
          
         I then gave her the costings and details of flights and accommodation and told her that I’d need payment by cash or bank cheque only, by 10am Friday morning. She said ‘That’s fine, I’ll be in first thing Friday morning to pay for it.’ 
          
          
         About 9.30am on Friday the 12 April 1996 I was at work and Elizabeth Figueria came into the shop and gave me a total of $993.00 cash, which I then receipted and gave her an itinerary and confirmation. I then told her to come back within a ten minute period and I’d have her tickets ready. I requested no formal identification from Elizabeth, because it was a domestic booking and she paid by cash. 
          
          
         She went away and then came back about ten minutes later. I then gave her the documents and she left. 
          
          
         After taking the money I put it in my drawer, then within ten minutes Nagwa Kaldas came from upstairs in the office and took possession of the money after signing a receipt on the top right corner of the receipt that I had filled out. She then took the money away.” 
          
          
         
        
       
     112 Patsalis said, without giving evidence on the point, that he was ignorant of the existence of Mr Martinez’ statement at the trial.  
      
       
     113 The purpose of seeking to tender Mr Martinez’ statement was not directly to demonstrate the incompetence of Patsalis’ lawyers. Rather Patsalis submitted that the statement of Mr Martinez was relevant in establishing errors in the evidence of Mrs Spathis and Mr Stratikopoulos. The essential differences from which these “errors” were inferred were as follows. Mrs Spathis said that during the morning of 11 April 1996 she spoke to Mr Martinez “confirming some departure times” and said that her first contact was on 10 April 1996; Mr Martinez suggested not that he was confirming times on 11 April 1996, but was making initial inquiries on that day and that there had been no inquiry on 10 April 1996. Mr Martinez’ statement suggested that the proposed holiday was not arranged prior to 11 April 1996, while Mr Stratikopoulos (Mr Spathis’ business partner) said the holiday had been discussed with him “about four, five months, three months before” and that the holiday was planned to take place from Monday 15 April to Friday 19 April (the latter being the date of Mrs Spathis’ birthday).  
      
       
     114 These arguments proceed on narrow differences between Mr Martinez’ statement and Mrs Spathis’ evidence. They also overlook the vagueness of Mr Stratikopoulos’ evidence and thereby exaggerate its significance. They attribute excessive significance to the fact that a five day holiday from 13 to 17 April 1996 does not precisely coincide with Mrs Spathis’ birthday on 19 April.  
      
       
     115 Mr Martinez’ statement was not “fresh” evidence. It was either known to Patsalis or to his advisers at the time of the trial, or ought reasonably to have been known to them: the Crown informed this Court, without contradiction, that the statement of Mr Martinez was among the committal papers; that Patsalis’ solicitor was informed that the Crown did not intend to call Mr Martinez at the trial; and that the Crown received no request to call him at the trial. Further, in the course of the trial the Crown mentioned, at a time when Patsalis was represented by Mr Amor-Smith, that it had evidence taken from a person at the travel agency with which Mrs Spathis had dealt. 
      
       
     116 Since the evidence is not “fresh” evidence, there is no point in admitting it unless it could lead to the quashing of the conviction, and it will not have this result unless the Court is “convinced that there has been a miscarriage of justice”: R v Henry (1992) 28 NSWLR 348 at 351 per Loveday J, Priestley JA and Sully J concurring, citing Ratten v R (1974) 131 CLR 510 at 517-518 per Barwick CJ, McTiernan, Stephen and Jacobs JJ concurring.  
      
       
     117 Even if Mr Martinez’ statement was “fresh” evidence, so far as it goes only to credit it is less likely to lead to a new trial: R v Zaidi (1991) 57 A Crim R 189 at 193 et seq per Priestley JA, Allen and Badgery-Parker JJ concurring.  
      
       
     118 Whether or not the precise rules governing the reception of further evidence on appeal, “fresh” or not, can be said to be entirely clear, and whether or not it is desirable that they be entirely clear, are not questions which it is necessary to examine in detail. That is because it is clear that even if the evidence is not “fresh”, “the strength of the … evidence may in some cases be such as to justify interference with the verdict, even though that evidence might have been discovered before the trial”: Gallagher v R (1986) 160 CLR 392 at 395 per Gibbs CJ.  
      
       
     119 Mr Martinez’ statement lacks sufficient strength to raise the possibility of a miscarriage of justice within the meaning of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. That is not because it was not available. It is because it went to peripheral and marginal issues. The precise dealings between Mrs Spathis and Mr Martinez, and the precise question of whether the holiday was in fact planned and for how long would not have affected the conclusion to which the jury came in view of the strength of the direct evidence against Patsalis. If the question is whether, in the language of Mason CJ in Mickelberg v R (1989) 167 CLR 259 at 273, applied by this Court in R v Drummond and Domican (No 2) (1990) 46 A Crim R 408 at 419 by Kirby ACJ, Campbell and Studdert JJ concurring (which were both cases of “fresh” evidence), there was “a significant possibility that the jury acting reasonably would have acquitted the [accused] of the charge if the new evidence had been before it at the trial”, the answer should be “no”. 
      
       
        
       Further evidence: production of police records 
       
     120 Patsalis indicated a desire to obtain production of certain computer records dated 12 April 1996 associated with the investigation into the murder of the victim. He described what he hoped to prove thus: 
      
       
        
         
         “I will prove that no police inquiry was made on the computer system until well after 6.30pm on the Friday evening of 12 April 1996. In the court transcript and on the voir dires in particular where counsel continually cross-examined the police officers their in court testimony was that at about ten past six in the evening of 12 April 1996 that they received a telephone call from particular witnesses i.e. Mr and Mrs Jeffries who passed on the car registration of POZ-344 which was the vehicle of Mr Spathis. And in turn they used that information to find out Mrs Spathis’ home address at Randwick and they specifically testified to these events as being true and correct. 
          
          
         What I will be hoping to prove to the court are two matters: one is that no search was made until after 6.30pm on that evening. Two, that the in court testimony of the police officers was from the voir dires false and two particular police officers had in fact lied. Three, it then goes to the admissibility of Ex G and how it was illegally obtained and fourthly it will allow me to make further allegations that two witnesses’ statements were manufactured in the police brief and I will be able to prove all that through those two documents.” 
          
         
        
       
     121 Patsalis gave no satisfactory explanation for why he had taken no effective steps to obtain the documents in the twenty months that passed between his conviction and the hearing of the appeal. The Crown said it had not received any notice since the trial that Patsalis wanted the material included in the appeal papers. The Crown also said that the Registrar of this Court had warned Patsalis that all relevant material had to be before the Court by 2 July 2001. And the Crown pointed out that even if the police records recorded no call before 6.10pm, it would not follow that none had been made. None of these propositions was controverted by Patsalis. 
      
       
     122 Leaving aside the wholly unsatisfactory failure to bring this matter before the Court with appropriate speed and the fact that Patsalis evidently and unacceptably contemplated that the appeal could be adjourned as often and for as long as he desired, no substantive ground was made out for an adjournment of the appeal or for an order to be made under s 12 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. That is because the matter of whether Exhibit G was admissible was thoroughly investigated at trial. Even if the production of the documents sought might have showed that some part of the relevant police officers’ evidence was mistaken, it was not shown how any part of the trial judge’s reasoning in support of the admission of Exhibit G was flawed in such a way as to raise any reasonable possibility that the conclusion was wrong.  
      
       
     123 Further, even if further police records would reveal that Exhibit G was handed in by Patsalis at a time when one of the circumstances described in s 139(1)(a) or (5)(a), (b) or (c) of the Evidence Act 1995 existed, it is inconceivable that the trial judge would have exercised his discretion under s 138 against reception of the evidence. All the material factors bearing on the problem pointed towards admission.  
      
       
        
       Alleged incompetence of Mr Amor-Smith: general 
       
     124 Before examining the detail of Patsalis’ complaints about Mr Amor-Smith’s alleged incompetence, some preliminary matters should be borne in mind.  
      
       
     125 When Patsalis was being cross-examined by counsel for Spathis on 24 August 1999, he was asked, and he answered the following question:  
      
       
        
         
         “Q. You sat here and had your counsel put your case with great care and thoroughness, day in and day out. He spent two days taking you through your account, didn’t he? 
          
          
         A. And I did all the preparation in relation to a lot of works sir because I don’t have anyone to just jump in and take control of the situation.” 
          
         
        
       
       
       No doubt Patsalis did a lot of preparation, but he did not dissent from the description of Mr Amor-Smith as having shown “great care and thoroughness”. Further, the trial judge described Mr Amor-Smith’s written submissions on sentence as being “helpful”. There are other instances where the trial judge praised Mr Amor-Smith’s efforts, though he, like the other counsel, was also subjected to observations of an apparently critical character from time to time by the trial judge.  
        
       
     126 So far as Mr Amor-Smith was attacked by Patsalis for not having prepared the case, the author of this state of affairs was Patsalis himself. It flowed from his decision to dismiss Mr MacGregor, which was foolish at best. It may be that if the possibility of a miscarriage of justice emerged, it would be no answer to a challenge to the conviction that that possibility was the result of the accused’s own doing. But an issue would then arise whether what Patsalis did was only foolish or was part of a more sinister tactical ploy. Some support for the view that it was a tactical ploy might be afforded by Patsalis’ dismissal in turn of Mr Amor-Smith, and by his behaviour in the days before final address, in which much time was frittered away in vain inquiries about Patsalis’ employment records. But it is not necessary to investigate that issue. 
      
       
     127 Patsalis criticised Mr Amor-Smith’s lack of preparedness on Monday 2 August 1999. That is an invalid criticism, since Mr Amor-Smith had only been briefed the previous Friday. Mr Amor-Smith’s account of what he had done is entirely consistent with having spent the whole weekend on the case. So far as Patsalis made criticisms of Mr Amor-Smith’s lack of preparation and knowledge of the case thereafter, they have not been made out.  
      
       
     128 Patsalis submitted that Mr Amor-Smith’s account of his dismissal on 2 September 1999 was “dramatic and unusual which created unfairness and prejudice” to Patsalis. Any such outcome was entirely self-induced. It was not open to Mr Amor-Smith simply to depart in meek silence without some explanation to the trial judge for his departure. In any event, Mr Amor-Smith account was given in the absence of the jury.  
      
       
     129 Patsalis complained that there was a failure to ask the trial judge for a direction to the jury not to speculate about the reason for the termination of the retainer of a kind similar to that which the trial judge gave after Mr MacGregor was dismissed. Yet it was Patsalis who failed to apply for the direction, not Mr Amor-Smith. Mr Amor-Smith’s role had ceased at 3.30 pm on 2 September 1999.  
      
       
     130 Patsalis pointed out that the trial judge said that Mrs Spathis, from Spathis’ viewpoint, “got off reasonably lightly, in terms of cross-examination” by Mr Amor-Smith. This was said to be a criticism by the trial judge of Mr Amor-Smith. Yet in the same breath the trial judge indicated that that statement was made without “in any way disparaging Mr Amor-Smith, who was plainly doing his best and doing a professional job”.  
      
       
     131 Patsalis complained that Mr Amor-Smith failed to put questions in accordance with instructions. It is for counsel to form a judgment as to what questions to ask. Non-compliance with a client’s instructions about the lines to be taken in cross-examination is not evidence of incompetence, let alone prejudice or a miscarriage of justice.  
      
       
        
       Complaints about Mr Amor-Smith’s examination in chief of Patsalis 
       
     132 Mr Amor-Smith was said by Patsalis to have been flagrantly incompetent for not verifying “the accuracy and truthfulness” of Patsalis’ record of interview. By this Patsalis meant that he had not been asked in terms while testifying near the end of his evidence in chief on 18 August 1999 whether everything he said in his record of interview was true. But as the trial judge said when the matter was discussed on 19 August 1999, Mr Amor-Smith’s questions achieved the same ultimate result as if he had asked Patsalis to verify the record of interview, namely putting the record of interview in evidence for all purposes by asking Patsalis to correct anything that was inaccurate. And the record of interview was explicitly stated to be true and correct, but for some mistakes, in further evidence in chief given by Patsalis on 19 August. If there is any error here, it was certainly not prejudicial. 
      
       
     133 Patsalis then submitted that Mr Amor-Smith should have given him an opportunity to point out the inaccuracies, particularly the important inaccuracies, in the record of interview; an opportunity to explain why they occurred; and an opportunity to modify and correct the inaccuracies. Yet when the matter was dealt with in the additional evidence in chief given by Patsalis, Mr Amor-Smith repeatedly gave Patsalis opportunities to correct inaccuracies. It was for Patsalis, who was giving the evidence, not counsel able to do no more than elicit it by non-leading questions, to identify inaccuracies. Further, it is far from clear that evidence in chief explaining why the inaccuracies occurred would, strictly speaking, have been admissible. Arguably questions directed to that would have been questions seeking evidence which “merely bolsters the credibility of a party”: Palmer v R (1998) 193 CLR 1 at 21 per McHugh J. “Only facts in issue should be led in chief. A witness may not lift himself by his own bootstraps to enhance his credit”: R v Connelly [1991] 2 Qd R 171 at 173 per Thomas J, Dowsett J concurring. Arguably the evidence in chief suggested would have been a “premature attempted rebuttal of [a] challenge”, which is a practice which “should cease”: at 173-174. Patsalis submitted that he suffered prejudice in not being assisted in understanding “his possible rights particularly in connection with any compromise of the case”. The reference to a compromise, which is not unique in Patsalis’ submissions, is totally unrealistic. Patsalis submitted that the matter was dealt with on the run, without him having had the opportunity to reflect on matters. Yet he had just given lengthy evidence in chief on the twenty-ninth and thirtieth day of the trial: he had had every opportunity to reflect on the errors in his record of interview.  
      
       
     134 Patsalis submitted that Mr Amor-Smith’s examination in chief of him was equivalent to cross-examination, it being repetitive and intimidating, despite the “precision” of Patsalis’ answers. Yet in fact it was largely Mr Amor-Smith’s persistence which enabled clarity to be brought into those answers.  
      
       
        
       Complaints about Mr Amor-Smith’s failure to object to questions in cross-examination of Patsalis 
        
       
     135 Mr Amor-Smith was criticised for not objecting to questions asked by counsel for the Crown and Spathis of Patsalis inviting his assent to the proposition that other witnesses were giving “deliberately misleading” or “false” or “made up” or “completely made up” evidence, or “were lying” or “lied”. Among other cases, Patsalis cited R v Foley (1998) 105 A Crim R 1 at 8 for the proposition that counsel should not invite a witness to answer by commenting on the truthfulness of other witnesses. But he did not mention the following statement by the Queensland Court of Appeal in that case: “There must of course be a certain degree of tolerance of loose practices in cross-examination, and such errors commonly occur without impairing overall the receipt of a fair trial by an accused person”.  
      
       
     136 Patsalis submitted that the use of the inadmissible questions “forced [him] to retract his evidence, in order to preserve his credit and credibility and to prevent the cross-examination from escalating and continuing along the same lines.  
      
       
     137 So far as the questions merely asked Patsalis to agree that if his evidence was correct, that of other witnesses was incorrect, they were not impermissible. That is merely a strong way of identifying precisely what the evidence of Patsalis was in relation to that of other witnesses. Contrary to Patsalis’ submissions, the questions did not go so far as to seek Patsalis’ views on why the other witnesses were lying. Patsalis submitted that some questions by the Crown “by implication” asked the question “Why would witnesses be in conflict with Patsalis?” This is incorrect. The closest the questioning came to a question of that prohibited kind is one asked when differences between Patsalis’ evidence and that of the Jefferis family were being explored. At 1575 line 6-10, the evidence was: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. You’ve got no reason you can suggest to the court that they would completely make up their evidence, have you? 
          
          
         A. That’s not what I’m referring to when I say it’s totally false.” 
          
         
        
       
       
       That question asked why the Jefferis family might be lying but the mischief was removed by Patsalis’ contention that they were not. At 1660 lines 21-39 the following appears: 
        
         
         “Q. Would you agree with me that it is impossible to reconcile the two versions, in the sense your version is very different from their version? 
          
          
         A. Yes I don’t deny saying that sir. 
          
          
         Q. Would you agree with me that it is impossible to reconcile the two versions, in the sense that your version is very different from their version? 
          
          
         A. Yes it is different sir. 
          
          
         Q. Quite different, isn’t it? 
          
          
         A. It is sir. 
          
          
         Q. Have you got any explanation for that now? 
          
          
         A. The only thing that I can think of sir is in relation to perhaps they may have seen me when I came out of the car when I was parked behind the red car. I don’t know. When I was driving up that road, I certainly don’t recall seeing a car as is in the diagram that we saw of Mr and Mrs Jefferis, so – they gave their evidence and as you stated earlier they are independent. We have never met so they wouldn’t hold a grudge against me, so, I don’t know. I have no explanation for that.” 
          
         
        
       To ask for an “explanation” in one sense invites the possible answer “They are lying and I am not”. That was not an answer which Patsalis gave. Further, Patsalis’ submission that in final address the Crown asked “Why would the Jefferis family lie?” is also quite baseless. There were questions in which Patsalis was asked to accept characterisations of the evidence of other witnesses as being deliberately untrue. In general that is a form of questioning to be avoided. But Patsalis has not demonstrated the proposition that he was forced to retract his evidence or that the style of questioning “pressured and bullied” him. And he has certainly not demonstrated that the questioning not objected to has caused any prejudice. Further, non-objection may well have been seen as a prudent tactic, and that perception has solid justification. Triers of fact often do not like to see excessive protectiveness of party-witnesses on the part of the counsel calling them. Trial judges often resent the flow of cross-examination being interrupted by objections even if they have some technical force because they may be seen as an attempt to rest the witness or to hint at particular answers. Successful resistance by a party-witness, unassisted by helpful objections, to an aggressive cross-examination can improve that party-witness’s acceptability in the eyes of triers of fact. These are all valid tactical considerations which may well have influenced Mr Amor-Smith’s approach.  
        
       
     138 The same answer invalidates Patsalis’ complaint that Mr Amor-Smith failed to object to questions which were, or which Patsalis submits were, inadmissible by reason of s 41 of the Evidence Act 1995.  
      
       
     139 In general Patsalis submitted that the Crown’s cross-examination of him was impermissible to the extent that this caused a miscarriage of justice. Any departure by the Crown from what the law strictly requires of a cross-examiner was not sufficiently prejudicial to the interests of Patsalis to amount to appellable error or to create any risk of a miscarriage of justice, whether considered by itself or with any other complaint.  
      
       
        
       Re-examination by Mr Amor-Smith 
       
     140 Patsalis submitted that Mr Amor-Smith failed to clarify ambiguities which had been left unexplained and incomplete during the cross-examination which counsel for the Crown and Spathis conducted of Patsalis. In large measure Patsalis submitted that much of this re-examination could have been conducted “by simply picking up the appellant’s record of interview and addressing the areas in question”. This is the same record of interview, of course, which Mr Amor-Smith was criticised for failing to have corrected in the evidence in chief. However, since the contents of the record of interview were in evidence in relation to Patsalis because the Crown had tendered it, and in evidence for all purposes by reason of Patsalis’ adoption of it in the witness box, it is hard to see how any evidentiary gap was created which might have led to a miscarriage of justice. Much of the suggested re-examination would not have been permissible, because the cross-examiners gave Patsalis an opportunity to give explanations and because in many instances there was nothing to clear up in the sense that any re-examination would merely have been an invitation to Patsalis to change his testimony. A large part of the suggested re-examination would have been an invitation to Patsalis to give evidence which he had opportunities to give in chief or in cross-examination, and which he often had given (for example, evidence about his fatigue while being interviewed by the police). Further, many of the points which Patsalis submits should have been cleared up were trivial to a degree.  
      
       
     141 A failure to re-examine is not necessarily a sign of incompetence. It can flow from a conscious and sensible decision based on the desire to reduce forensic damage. A lengthy re-examination can be a tribute paid to cross-examining counsel for the latter’s great success in cross-examination – a tribute which it can be unwise to pay in the presence of the trier of fact.  
      
       
     142 In no respect has any possibility of a miscarriage of justice arising from defective re-examination been demonstrated.  
      
       
        
       Mr Amor-Smith’s capacity to argue legal submissions 
       
     143 Patsalis submitted that Mr Amor-Smith did not satisfactorily advance arguments of law to the trial judge. Many of the examples given relate to the period just after Mr Amor-Smith came into the case. Patsalis submitted that he was prejudiced by Mr Amor-Smith’s “ineptness and inefficiency in matters of law”. Mr Amor-Smith’s knowledge and application of the law were also said to be “deficient, appalling and incompetent in the extreme”.  
      
       
     144 These submissions should be rejected. A perusal of Mr Amor-Smith’s contributions to legal argument does not reveal either that they were incompetent (in particular, given the time at which they were made) or that they were likely to create any possible miscarriage of justice. Patsalis’ submissions fail to distinguish between the proposition that some of Mr Amor-Smith’s arguments failed and the proposition that Mr Amor-Smith was incompetent. 
      
       
        
       Mr Amor-Smith’s failure to seek adjournments 
       
     145 Patsalis submitted that Mr Amor-Smith should have sought an adjournment or adjournments soon after he came into the case to enable him to prepare it. It is highly unlikely that the trial judge would have allowed any substantial adjournment in view of the terms of what he said to Mr Amor-Smith on 2 August 1999.  
      
       
        
       Mr Amor-Smith’s admissions 
       
     146 To some extent Patsalis relied on various self-deprecating remarks Mr Amor-Smith made. For example, at 2015 line 48 he said he had been trying to catch up since he came into the case. That and other similar remarks are understandable, but they do not indicate that Patsalis was not being professionally served by Mr Amor-Smith or that any possibility of a miscarriage of justice was generated. They are no more significant than similar remarks which Mr MacGregor had made.  
      
       
        
       Non-separation of trials 
       
     147 Patsalis propounded arguments in support of a supplementary ground of appeal that the trial judge’s failure to separate the trials led to unfairness arising from the admission of prejudicial evidence which was otherwise inadmissible. To some extent the arguments overlap with arguments based on the supposed incompetence of both Patsalis’ counsel. 
      
       
     148 So far as Patsalis’ arguments contended that the trial judge should have ordered separate trials from the outset, they were all put to and considered by the trial judge in his reasons for judgment delivered on 30 June 1999 in which he rejected Mr MacGregor’s application on behalf of Patsalis for separation: [1999] NSWSC 649. Those reasons for judgment are a model of their kind. They are adopted as part of these reasons for judgment. It is only necessary to add, in particular, that it cannot be said that the evidence against one accused was significantly weaker than and different from the evidence against the other.  
      
       
     149 Patsalis submitted that even if the trial judge’s initial decision was correct, it should have been reconsidered when Spathis gave evidence and swore to the truth of his record of interview. Patsalis has not, however, demonstrated that any greater prejudice then arose than that which the trial judge had already taken into account. Further, an application for separate trials at that stage would mean that at least one trial would have to start afresh even though the very lengthy hearing was nearly over. That is not an outcome which the trial judge could have been expected to have accepted with any equanimity.  
      
       
        
       Accomplice warning 
       
     150 Patsalis submitted that the trial judge erred in giving an “accomplice warning” to the jury pursuant to s 165(1)(d) of the Evidence Act 1995, and that Mr Amor-Smith was incompetent in permitting this. Far from this being an error, if Mr Amor-Smith had not permitted it to happen, and if the trial judge had not given the warning, an appeal brought by Spathis might have succeeded, subject to the application of the proviso.  
      
       
        
       Warning about Patsalis’ evidence 
       
     151 Patsalis submitted that when the trial judge warned the jury, near the end of his evidence-in-chief, to keep an open mind about the issues, he erred. At worst that warning appears harmless; at best it was necessary from Spathis’ point of view.  
      
       
        
       Alleged failure of Mr Amor-Smith to cross-examine Spathis’ wife, uncle, father and business partner 
        
       
     152 Patsalis submitted that his credit was the most vital issue in the case. He submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “Counsel ought to have protected the appellant’s credit by cross-examining critical witnesses on the primary facts associated with the essential elements of the eventual case by one, challenging on oath the evidence of various witnesses to determine their ‘mettle under attack’, two, challenge the corroborative evidence, three, to highlight and illustrate the various inconsistencies and contradictions, four, to challenge the explanations or qualifications made by a witness, five, to contradict a witness’s evidence especially when it related to or concerned directly the case of the appellant … .” 
          
          
         
        
       
     153 To some extent this submission was supported by authorities on the rule in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67. That rule is a rule intended to protect the party whose witness was not cross-examined, and also to protect that witness; it is not intended to protect the party represented by the counsel who does not cross-examine. However, in general the description of counsel’s duty as propounded by Patsalis may be accepted. The question is whether any significant breach of it took place.  
      
       
        
       Mrs Spathis 
       
     154 Patsalis submitted that Mr Amor-Smith should have cross-examined Mrs Spathis about precisely when she withdrew $1,000 from an automatic teller machine to pay for the holiday she and Spathis were planning to take on the Gold Coast. This was said to have been a “highly relevant” issue “as it allows one to further draw a number of inferences upon such matters as time and telephone calls which originated between the two on Thursday 11 April 1996”. Whether this refers to calls between Mrs Spathis and Spathis or Mrs Spathis and Mr Martinez, Patsalis never explained why it was highly relevant and what significance the supposed inferences would have had.  
      
       
     155 Patsalis criticised Mr Amor-Smith for not cross-examining Mrs Spathis on her evidence that at 4.40pm on Thursday 11 April 1996, she called Spathis; asked him where he was; and was told he was parked outside Bankstown shopping centre reading the Trading Post since he was looking for a car part. She testified that they talked about the holiday and he asked what she wanted for her birthday. She testified that they discussed whether she would attend The Three Swallows Hotel that evening and that she would call him back at 7pm to confirm this.  
      
       
     156 Patsalis drew attention to the fact that in her statement of 12 April 1996 she said Spathis “was apparently doing some running around for the holiday in between lunches at the bistro [run by Spathis and Mr Stratikopoulos at The Three Swallows Hotel] and re-opening”. Patsalis submitted that this was surprising since she had not yet informed Spathis she had provisionally booked the Gold Coast holiday, and one would have expected her to have told him what she had done in the 4.40pm telephone conversation. Yet the call only lasted one minute and twenty-five seconds, which was insufficient to pass on all the details. 
      
       
     157 Patsalis submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “As has been previously discussed Mrs Spathis’ prior-statements make no reference of Mr Spathis having parked outside the Bankstown Shopping Centre, that he was reading the Trading Post looking for car parts. There is no discussion recorded between the two that Mr Spathis asked his wife what she wanted for her birthday, and that they made arrangements for her to go to the Three Swallows Hotel that evening. Counsel failed to put or even challenge the conversations in this call, on the basis that they were recently invented to accord with the objective facts ie the telephone records (Exhibit BB), the records of interview and in particular that of her husband and ultimately upon the proof of evidence of her husband to which she was privy.” 
          
          
         
        
       
     158 However, Mr Amor-Smith may well have thought the differences immaterial. He may have thought that to allege that Mrs Spathis was “privy” to anything improper or was lying, leaving aside the ethical question of whether he had any instructions or adequate material on which to do this, may have been adverse to Patsalis’ interests. Further, to put that allegation might attract the reception under s 108(3)(b) of the Evidence Act 1995 of prior consistent statements of Mrs Spathis, which might have worsened Patsalis’ position by enhancing Mrs Spathis’ credibility. This was a matter flagged in argument both before the trial judge’s s 38 rulings and after Mrs Spathis left the witness box on 5 August 1999. That supports the conclusion that Mr Amor-Smith may well have had this problem in mind. Whatever Mr Amor-Smith thought, however, Patsalis has not shown any possibility that because Mr Amor-Smith cross-examined in the way he did, as distinct from the way which Patsalis now says should have been employed, a miscarriage of justice was caused. 
      
       
     159 Patsalis submitted that Mr Amor-Smith should have challenged Mrs Spathis’ evidence that while she and her husband were driving into the city on the morning of Friday 12 April 1996 to pay for their Gold Coast holiday tickets, he suggested that they not do so that day, she broke down in tears and told him he was “really stressed out”. Patsalis submitted that this was not mentioned in her statement of 12 April 1996 or her record of interview. Patsalis submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “Mrs Spathis’ in-court testimony could be characterised as quite a dramatic and an emotional breakdown by her whilst in the car with Mr Spathis comforting her laying the foundation for the submission later on that he was troubled about what had happened.” 
          
         
        
       
       
       Other differences were relied on. But it was open to Mr Amor-Smith to decline to cross-examine on the basis that Spathis’ distress in fact supported Patsalis’ case. 
        
       
     160 Patsalis also submitted that Mr Amor-Smith “failed to put to Mrs Spathis that she was lying to assist her husband with his case, tailoring her evidence to fit the objective facts.” Patsalis pointed to the fact that at 8.44pm on 11 April 1996 Spathis rang his wife from the Ryde-Epping area. In that call he falsely said his car had broken down and he was waiting for a tow. Mrs Spathis timed that call at about 8.30pm in her testimony in chief, and at 8.44pm in her cross-examination. She explained that improved specificity by having had access to telephone company records. Patsalis pointed out that in her statement of 12 April 1996 she had timed the call at 7pm. This difference by itself is scarcely significant. However, Patsalis said that in her testimony, unlike her 12 April 1996 statement, her husband sounded as though he was in a state of anxiety. Patsalis said this reflected badly on him, and that Mr Amor-Smith failed to notice this. However, in the course of argument on 4 August 1999 during the Crown’s first s 38 application, he did notice it (924 lines 34-38). He said he would return to her statement of 12 April 1996 (924 line 53). He did so (955 line 49-961 line 35). In the course of the Crown’s second s 38 application on 5 August 1996 counsel representing the Crown noted that while Mr Amor-Smith drew attention to differences between Mrs Spathis’ testimony and her statement, he did not cross-examine in detail about it. The fact is, however, that Mr Amor-Smith did expose to the jury many differences between what Mrs Spathis said in her 12 April 1996 statement and what she said in chief. This left it open to the jury to draw inferences about her bias. His instructions may not have permitted him to do more. Even if they did, he may have thought a frontal assault on Mrs Spathis imprudent, and likely to cause the jury to sympathise with her husband and become prejudiced against Patsalis. That tactical approach would be understandable. Mr Amor-Smith evidently had some tactical plan in mind, and he was interrupted while endeavouring to explain it to the trial judge (981 lines 3-24). But in any event no chance of any miscarriage of justice exists, because the Crown prosecutor later cross-examined Mrs Spathis on the inconsistencies. He put to her the accusations of embellishment and lying in order to assist her husband which Patsalis criticised Mr Amor-Smith for not putting. She denied them as put by the Crown prosecutor, as she no doubt would have denied them if they had been put by Mr Amor-Smith.  
      
       
     161 Patsalis attacked Mr Amor-Smith for not cross-examining Mrs Spathis about the clothing Spathis was wearing when he came home on the night of 11 April 1996. Few of the suggested questions would have assisted Patsalis’ case and in any event Patsalis could have suggested them to Mr Amor-Smith if they had seemed appropriate at the time.  
      
       
        
       Mr Stratikopoulos 
       
     162 Patsalis submitted that Mr Stratikopoulos said he was happy when phoned by Spathis to say he would not be coming to work on the night of 11 April 1996 at the bistro in The Three Swallows Hotel which the two of them ran, because if Mr Stratikopoulos worked that late shift, he could have the nights of Friday 12 and Saturday 13 April off. This was contradicted, said Patsalis, by Mrs Spathis’ 12 April 1996 statement indicating that she travelled to pick up her husband from work at 9.30pm on 12 April, which would not have been possible if Mr Stratikopoulos was not on duty to work the late shift. Yet there are possible explanations for the difference between Mr Stratikopoulos’ expectation on Thursday night of what would happen on Friday night and what actually did happen on Friday night. This and similar points made by Patsalis on peripheral issues do not reveal the risk of a miscarriage of justice.  
      
       
     163 Another area of Mr Stratikopoulos’ evidence which Patsalis said should have been the subject of cross-examination was that which related to Patsalis’ boasting in The Three Swallows Hotel in the presence of Spathis about his contacts with police and use of them by Patsalis to enable Spathis to regain his licence, to his flashing of a bank book to Mr Stratikopoulos and Spathis revealing an amount of over $0.5 million in the bank, and to his showing of a car boot full of cigarette cartons to Spathis. Before Mr Stratikopoulos gave evidence for the Crown, counsel for Spathis foreshadowed that he would be cross-examining to elicit that evidence in order to establish “a foundation for a belief on [Spathis’] part that Mr Patsalis was a person who had contacts, who could arrange various things relating to cigarettes”, as the trial judge said at 855 lines 38-40. This was in order to rebut a Crown contention that the absence of any cigarettes was adverse to the accused. 
      
       
     164 Patsalis’ submission assumes that Mr Amor-Smith was given instructions that these allegations were incorrect and that he failed to cross-examine Mr Stratikopoulos to suggest they were incorrect.  
      
       
     165 There are several problems with the submission, apart from the lack of sworn evidence that the instructions were given.  
      
       
     166 First, as Patsalis’ submission acknowledged, “Mr Stratikopoulos had no personal knowledge upon most of the matters to which he testified”. By that Patsalis meant that though Mr Stratikopoulos claimed to have heard and seen what he said Patsalis did in his presence, he did not know the truth of the underlying suggestions Patsalis was making. He could not be cross-examined about those suggestions. 
      
       
     167 Secondly, so far as Mr Stratikopoulos gave evidence of the regular presence of Patsalis at The Three Swallows Hotel, it was confirmed by Patsalis’ own evidence in chief (1317-1318). So far as Mr Stratikopoulos said Patsalis flashed his bank book and represented that he had over $0.5 million on deposit, Patsalis said the same in his evidence in chief (1326-1329), his record of interview, and in Exhibit G. So far as Mr Stratikopoulos suggested that Patsalis gave Spathis the impression he had valuable police contacts, Patsalis had admitted this in his record of interview (questions 61 and 68). So far as the evidence about a car boot being full of cigarette cartons was concerned, Mr Stratikopoulos was only describing what Spathis told him. Mr Stratikopoulos did not claim that he himself had seen the cigarettes. The appropriate person to cross-examine was Spathis, and when the time for cross-examining Spathis came, Patsalis was representing himself after the dismissal of Mr Amor-Smith.  
      
       
     168 Patsalis complained that Mr Stratikopoulos’ evidence that the two knives used in the killing, Exhibit AC, were not of a type to be used by the bistro should have been the subject of cross-examination along the following lines: 
      
       
        
         
         “1. Counsel failed to put to Mr Stratikopoulos that Exhibit AC were in fact knives used by them in their bistro? 
          
          
         2. That such knives were stuck up on the wall near the knife rack? 
          
          
         3. To challenge Mr Stratikopoulos that they had indeed bought knives whilst Mr Spathis and he ran the bistro? 
          
          
         4. To put to Mr Stratikopoulos what would your taxation records filed at the Australian Taxation Department reveal in respect to purchasing knives? 
          
          
         5. Counsel failed to put to Mr Stratikopoulos questions referable to the Bistro. 
          
          
         a) Was it his usual practice to allow patrons in the bistro? 
          
          
         b) Why it was that the appellant had unrestricted access to the bistro? 
          
          
         c) To his knowledge whilst present how many times over the two year period had the appellant been inside the bistro? 
          
          
         d) To describe the layout of the bistro, particularly where the knives were ‘struck up’ on the tiling and where the knife rack was situated? 
          
          
         e) The assistance provided to  
         him 
          and to Mr Spathis whilst they were busy. 
          
          
         f) The various duties and tasks performed by the appellant on their behalf in respect to the shopping? 
          
          
         g) Mr Stratikopoulos’ knowledge of Mr Spathis attending The Bankstown Shopping Centre, for shopping purposes.” 
          
          
         
        
       
     169 This submission reveals how inconsequential the supposed deficiencies in Mr Amor-Smith’s cross-examination were. The questions proposed veer between the unanswerable, the irrelevant and the harmful. Under cross-examination Patsalis said that had he been cross-examining Mr Stratikopoulos, he would have cross-examined about the knives, but that is highly questionable. He could have asked Mr Amor-Smith to do so. Mr Amor-Smith successfully obtained leave to cross-examine Mr Stratikopoulos further (896) some time after Mr Amor-Smith’s first cross-examination of Mr Stratikopoulos had ceased. 
      
       
     170 Patsalis complained that Mr Stratikopoulos’ testimony introduced into the evidence the proposition that Patsalis was a former police officer. That was the result of a considered decision of the trial judge. There was nothing more Mr Amor-Smith could have done than he did. For Mr Amor-Smith to have cross-examined Mr Stratikopoulos about it would have worsened matters from Patsalis’ point of view. When the Crown prosecutor dealt with aspects of his training at the Police Academy, Mr Amor-Smith argued against admissibility: his opposition failed, but again there was no more he could have done.  
      
       
     171 Patsalis criticised Mr Amor-Smith for not cross-examining Mr Stratikopoulos about the fact that Patsalis stopped coming to The Three Swallows Hotel. Mr Stratikopoulos only gave evidence about the time, not about the reasons. This conformed with a ruling of the trial judge: Mr Amor-Smith could not have cross-examined without contravening that ruling, and it was a ruling which the trial judge had made in the interests of Patsalis. 
      
       
     172 Patsalis also submitted that Mr Amor-Smith should have cross-examined Mr Stratikopoulos about his knowledge of Patsalis’ debts to Spathis. The existence of these debts was common ground, readily admitted by Patsalis. A lack of cross-examination on the point was not adverse to Patsalis’ interests.  
      
       
     173 Any deficiency in Mr Amor-Smith’s cross-examination of Mr Stratikopoulos is readily explained by the fact that Mr Stratikopoulos gave evidence on Tuesday 3 August. It was only on Monday 2 August that Mr Amor-Smith had announced his appearance. He had been granted an adjournment only until 3 August. The Crown said on 2 August that for the next one to one and a half days witnesses relating only to Spathis, not Patsalis, would be called. That prediction was not fulfilled, because though the first two witnesses that day were in that category, as the Crown frankly conceded at 854, the third–sixth witnesses were not, and nor was the seventh, Mr Stratikopoulos, or the eighth, Mrs Spathis.  
      
       
        
       Admission of Exhibit G 
       
     174 Patsalis mingled submissions complaining about the misuse by counsel for the Crown and for Spathis of Exhibit G and about Mr Amor-Smith’s failure to object to this misuse.  
      
       
     175 Spathis in his appeal complained about the use of Exhibit G as relationship evidence. The arguments advanced on his behalf were, mutatis mutandis, also advanced by Patsalis. Those arguments, as advanced by Patsalis, should be rejected for the reasons given by Carruthers AJ in relation to Spathis. In particular, the trial judge ruled carefully on the limited use to be made of those parts of Exhibit G that did not touch directly on the events surrounding the crime and gave careful directions about Exhibit G. The cross-examination to which Patsalis says Mr Amor-Smith should have objected remained within the trial judge’s rulings: in particular, it went to admissible relationship evidence, not inadmissible evidence in the nature of similar fact evidence. 
      
       
        
       Failure of Mr Amor-Smith to attack Spathis’ character 
       
     176 Patsalis submitted that when counsel for Spathis elicited from Detective Sergeant Jacob the fact that after inquiries were made about Spathis, it was found that no matters were known against him, Spathis threw away his shield. Patsalis submitted “Mr Spathis having raised his character at trial, it afforded counsel the opportunity to challenge and to discredit the co-accused on his character.”  
      
       
     177 Three items of discreditable behaviour were referred to.  
      
       
     178 The first related to a mobile phone. Patsalis submitted that Mrs Spathis should have been cross-examined to elicit the fact that mobile phone number 0419444766 was connected in her name but was used by both her and her husband; and that they found it a month or two before 12 April 1996 in the toilets at Coogee. Patsalis submitted that she should have been asked” 
      
       
        
         
         “1. Was any attempt made to take the phone to the police? 
          
          
          Was it ever contemplated to do so? Why not? 
          
          
         2. In your statement you state ‘We found it’, who actually found the mobile telephone? 
          
          
         3. Was it ever attempted by you or your husband to call the original owner to return the mobile phone? 
          
          
         4. How was it possible for you to activate the phone? 
          
          
         5. You needed to remove the initial owners phone card chip from the back in order to have the phone activated? 
          
          
         6. Generally such behaviour is dishonest.” 
          
         
        
       
       
       (Patsalis also incidentally submitted: 
        
         
         “Counsel having come into the case quite late could not appreciate the relevance and importance of the Coogee area. Had counsel’s knowledge been of the required level, counsel would have been required to ask specific questions about the Coogee Bay Hotel, Coogee Beach, the distance between their residence at 18 St Paul Street, Randwick and Coogee Beach. How often it was that Mr and Mrs Spathis frequented Coogee and for what purpose? Such questioning would be later used to accord with the appellant’s version of events.” 
          
         
        
       But Patsalis did not explain how.) 
        
       
     179 The second item related to a car which Spathis said in his record of interview had been in his possession for seven or eight months but had not been registered. Patsalis submitted that Mr Amor-Smith should have cross-examined “Mrs Spathis about her husband buying and selling … cars which were never registered in his name.”  
      
       
     180 The third item was put thus: 
      
       
        
         
         “Counsel also failed to challenge Mrs Spathis upon her historical recollection of Mr Spathis’ anti-social behaviour. (Her knowledge of Mr Spathis’ past ie rock and roll bands, a girlfriend who was addicted to drugs who played in the band etc).” 
          
          
         
        
       
     181 The possession of an unregistered car is not unlawful. Only its use on the road is. Participation in rock and roll bands is not of itself discreditable. The circumstances in which having as one’s girlfriend a drug addict who played in a rock and roll band would affect one’s good character, particularly one’s character as far as testimonial credibility is concerned, would have to be precisely defined and are likely to be somewhat confined. And while dishonest dealing in mobile telephones is not creditable, it is very likely that the trial judge would have rejected questions directed to Mr Spathis in the terms identified either in the exercise of his discretion under s 135 or in the exercise of his duty under s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995. Even if the questioning had been permitted, Mr Amor-Smith, had he turned his mind to it, which is unlikely in view of the far-fetched and indeed pointless nature of Patsalis’ suggestions, would have formed the view that the questioning would have been counter-productive, since it was likely to increase jury sympathy for Spathis and reduce it for Patsalis.  
      
       
     182 It is noteworthy, incidentally, that Patsalis never cross-examined Spathis on the three matters he contends Mrs Spathis should have been cross-examined on. That shows that this thought of Patsalis is no more than an afterthought. 
      
       
        
       Mr Amor-Smith’s failure to call witnesses to contradict Mr Stratikopoulos and Spathis 
        
       
     183 Patsalis submitted that Mr Amor-Smith should have called witnesses to contradict Mr Stratikopoulos and Spathis. He did not, however, identify them (apart from Mr Aroney, Operational Manager of The Three Swallows Hotel). Nor did he identify the subject-matter of their evidence, except for citing a reference which Mr Amor-Smith made to “several witnesses to be called in relation to Mr Patsalis being at The Three Swallows Hotel in the bistro area during 1996” before Patsalis’ case closed (see 2002 lines 23-25; see also 1608 lines 43-45, 1613 lines 6-17 and 1871 lines 3-10). After 26 August 1999 they were not mentioned again before the case did close. Patsalis has not established either by direct submission to this Court or by cross-reference to what Mr Amor-Smith said how the failure to call any evidence of this kind created any possibility of a miscarriage of justice. The examples which Patsalis gave are peripheral or have been dealt with earlier or both.  
      
       
        
       Mr John Spathis 
       
     184 Patsalis submitted that Mr John Spathis was important because he was the supplier of the cigarettes to be purchased by the victim, because his name was recorded as being involved in the cigarette business in the victim’s letter to be opened after 11pm on 11 April 1996 (Exhibit AX) and because on 12 August 1999 the jury asked to see a transcript of his cross-examination on 11 August 1999. Patsalis submitted that had a “detailed and precise cross-examination” of Mr Stratikopoulos and Mr Spathis taken place, it would have illustrated “how the witnesses weaved and tailored their testimony to accord and fit with the objective facts”, and “the means and lengths to which the wife and person friend/business partner were willing to lie, embellish, tailor and manufacture their testimony …”. Patsalis then submitted that this in turn: 
      
       
        
         
         “would have laid the foundation for the jury to be more diligent when assessing and evaluating the evidence of other family members of Mr Alexios Spathis and in particular the evidence of Mr John Spathis. It would also allow counsel a foundation upon which he would later be able to use whilst cross-examining Mr John Spathis.” 
          
         
        
       
       
       However, Patsalis did not demonstrate that any cross-examination of Mr John Spathis which did not take place would have created any greater possibility of acquittal. 
        
       
     185 Mr Amor-Smith was also criticised for not making an application under s 106(a) of the Evidence Act 1995: but Patsalis did not identify the evidence of bias or motive for untruthfulness to which the application would have related.  
      
       
     186 Mr Amor-Smith was criticised for not cross-examining Mr John Spathis about lending $5,000 to Spathis, putting this line of questioning to Mr Anastasios Spathis, and having to have Mr John Spathis recalled. No prejudice was caused. The proposition that Spathis borrowed “from his father, sister and other relatives” derives from Patsalis’ record of interview. Spathis’ father denied not only a $5,000 loan but a $1,000 loan. Mr John Spathis, when he was asked about the $5,000 loan, denied it. The fact that before this Patsalis was asked one question in cross-examination by Spathis’ counsel to the effect that Mr Amor-Smith had not questioned Mr John Spathis about the loan cannot have had any impact on the jury’s assessment of Patsalis’ credibility, particularly after Mr John Spathis’ recall.  
      
       
     187 There were numerous subjects on which Patsalis said Mr Amor-Smith should have cross-examined Mr John Spathis. It has not been shown that any of this cross-examination would have created the possibility of acquittal. 
      
       
        
       Spathis’ exploitation of Mr Amor-Smith’s failure to question witnesses 
        
       
     188 Patsalis submitted that during the summing up counsel for Spathis continually asked the trial judge to remind the jury that various witnesses were not challenged on particular matters. Some of these requests were declined because the points were trivial. Other contentions were rejected (e.g. the contention that Patsalis should not have submitted that Mrs Spathis was trying to do her best for her husband) because she had been given an opportunity to deal with the proposition that she was colouring her evidence to assist her husband. No prejudice in this respect has been shown to flow from the nature of Mr Amor-Smith’s cross-examination which was either defensible or, as the trial judge specifically noted during the arguments which occurred in the course of the summing up in relation to Mrs Spathis, explicable by his extremely recent arrival in the case. 
      
       
        
       Exhibit 7B 
       
     189 Patsalis submitted that Mr Amor-Smith failed to deal properly with evidence of a call made on 8 March 1996 at 2.23pm by the victim from the Parramatta area to The Three Swallows Hotel. Patsalis suggested that this established a link between the victim and Spathis. That is speculative, since it has not been shown that the victim did not know other people at the hotel. In any event, the evidence was before the court. Even if it did establish the link suggested, that would not have assisted Patsalis, partly because of the evidence of Patsalis’ links with the victim and partly because of the strength of the evidence against him on 11 April 1996.  
      
       
        
       Mr Grisdale and Mr Haniotis 
       
     190 Patsalis criticised Mr Amor-Smith for not cross-examining Mr Grisdale (who had dealings in tobacco with the victim) and Mr Haniotis (an habitué of the coffee shop at 12B Restwell Street, Bankstown). None of the questions suggested could have improved Patsalis’ chances of acquittal.  
      
       
        
       Conclusion on conviction 
       
     191 None of the arguments advanced by Patsalis in support of his appeal against conviction succeed.  
      
       
        
       The position of counsel 
       
     192 Neither Mr MacGregor nor Mr Amor-Smith was called to give evidence. No-one represented their interests on the appeal. In these circumstances it is appropriate to say the following. There is no doubt that for both Mr MacGregor and Mr Amor-Smith the trial was most burdensome – because of the nature of the case, because of their late arrival in it, and because Patsalis must have been a difficult client. There is also no doubt that Mr MacGregor and Mr Amor-Smith each put his best efforts into protecting Patsalis’ interests. Lest the reasoning set out above leaves any doubt about it, it should be recorded that nothing in Patsalis’ challenge to their performance supports any suggestion that Patsalis received less than professional and capable service. Though it is not necessary to reach any conclusion about this, there are grounds for thinking that he received more than that.  
      
       
        
       Sentence 
       
     193 Patsalis submitted that the sentence was in itself too severe; that there was a lack of parity in relation to Spathis’ sentence; and that the trial judge failed to take into account the assistance he gave to the police. 
      
       
     194 So far as Patsalis’ assistance to the police is concerned, the trial judge’s reasons for not discounting the sentence have already been set out. Patsalis did not advance specific arguments demonstrating error in that reasoning. The trial judge was entirely entitled to conclude that Patsalis’ decision to go to the police was not motivated by a desire to assist the police in solving the crime but to ensure that Spathis, and only Spathis, could be blamed for it. The trial judge was entitled to conclude that though Patsalis’ dealings with the police helped them in relation to Spathis, his account to them was untruthful, incomplete and unreliable.  
      
       
     195 The other two arguments were supported in part by references to authorities on parity and on the standard of proof, and in part by a repetition and development of some earlier arguments. Patsalis submitted that the trial judge erred in his fact finding in part because of the alleged incompetence of counsel. The primary errors alleged related to the extent to which Patsalis knew the victim, to the personal characteristics of the victim, and to the role of Mr John Spathis. Patsalis also pointed out that the Crown had not submitted that there was any difference in the culpability of each accused.  
      
       
     196 The trial judge based his findings of fact both on what was necessarily implicit in the jury verdict and on his own impressions. Both the jury verdict and the trial judge’s impressions were based on a judgment of the credibility of numerous witnesses. No convincing reason has been assigned for doubting the trial judge’s findings.  
      
       
     197 It follows that the sentence in itself was not excessive for so serious a crime and it follows that the conclusions on which the trial judge based the difference in sentences are not assailable. Once those conclusions are accepted, the difference between Patsalis’ sentence and Spathis’ sentence is not such as to leave Patsalis with a justifiable sense of grievance. The trial judge was entitled to reach a different view as to relative culpability from that which the Crown put to him.  
      
       
        
       Spathis appeal 
       
     198 I agree with the reasons of Carruthers AJ.  
      
       
        
       Orders 
       
     199 The following orders are proposed in Patsalis’ appeal. 
      
       
       
       1. The appeal against conviction is dismissed. 
        
        
       2. The application for leave to appeal against sentence is dismissed. 
        
       
     200 The following orders are proposed in Spathis’ appeal. 
      
       
       
       1. The appeal against conviction is dismissed. 
        
        
       2. The application for leave to appeal against sentence is dismissed. 
        
       
     201 CARRUTHERS AJ: With regard to the appeal by Michael Patsalis I agree that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons expressed by Heydon JA whose judgment I have had the benefit of reading in draft form. I also agree that Patsalis should be refused leave to appeal against sentence for the reasons expressed by his Honour.  
      
       
     202 I turn then to the appeal against conviction by Alexios Spathis. As the relevant background facts are set out in the judgment of Heydon JA, it is not necessary for me to repeat them here, except where reference to specific facts is essential.  
      
       
     203 The first ground of appeal (as amended) of the appellant Spathis is in the following terms: - 
      
       
        
         
         “The Appellant received an unfair trial in that the felony murder charge should have been left as an alternative count in the indictment to mens rea murder, and as a consequence the trial judge failed to properly or adequately direct the jury as to the ingredients of each offence.” 
         
        
       
     204 The indictment in this matter reads as follows: - 
      
       
        
         
         “On 10th June 1999 the Director of Public Prosecutions on behalf of Her Majesty charges that Michael Patsalis and Alexios Spathis on 11 April 1996 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did murder Klaus Peter Ludwig.” 
         
        
       
     205 This count was of course laid under the provisions of s 18 of the Crimes Act 1900, as amended, which section is in the following terms: -  
      
       
        
        “Murder and manslaughter defined 
        
        
         
         18.  
         (1)(a) Murder shall be taken to have been committed where the act of the accused, or thing by him or her omitted to be done, causing the death charged, was done or omitted with reckless indifference to human life, or with intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm upon some person, or done in an attempt to commit, or during or immediately after the commission, by the accused, or some accomplice with him or her, of a crime punishable by imprisonment for life or for 25 years. 
          
          
           
           (b) Every other punishable homicide shall be taken to be manslaughter. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (2) (a) No act or omission which was not malicious, or for which the accused had lawful cause or excuse, shall be within this section. 
          
         
        
        (b) No punishment or forfeiture shall be incurred by any person who kills another by misfortune only, or in his or her own defence.” 
        
         
        
       
     206 Bearing in mind that the Crown had no independent direct evidence of what actually transpired within the cabin of the truck at the time Mr Ludwig (to whom I shall hereafter refer as “the victim”) was fatally stabbed, it was necessary that the Crown formulate its case on alternative bases. Necessarily, felony murder had to be one of the alternatives. It is of course well established that where the essential facts upon which the Crown relies show a clear case against the accused, the Crown may rely on alternatives. The appellant does not challenge that proposition. As is clear from the formulation of the above ground, his contention is that as one of the alternatives upon which the Crown sought to base its case of murder was that of felony murder, that alleged basis of liability should have been the subject of an alternative count in the indictment to what was described as mens rea murder. The appellant contends that the failure to do so by the Crown occasioned him unfairness to such an extent that the conviction should be set aside. 
      
       
     207 It is convenient then to note the way in which the Crown opened its case to the jury. The first limb was described as one of individual responsibility or liability and categorised as mens rea murder. That is to say, in relation to each accused, the Crown alleged that the accused was guilty of murder on the basis that the death of the victim was caused by an act done by the accused himself, namely stabbing the victim, and that act was done with the intention of killing or inflicting grievous bodily harm upon the victim. 
      
       
     208 The second limb was that of joint responsibility. It was based upon the concept of a joint attack by the accused with a common intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm upon the victim. 
      
       
     209 The next limb was a common intent to rob the victim in company, during which robbery the victim was wounded, albeit there was no specific intent to kill the victim. That then was felony murder, with a foundational offence of (bare) robbery in company. By the time his Honour summed up to the jury, the Crown had identified armed robbery with wounding under s 98 of the Crimes Act as the foundational crime. The “felony murder” provisions in s 18 displace the common law principles. Accordingly, a preferable expression is “constructive murder”. However, as his Honour and counsel throughout the trial, and on this appeal, used the term “felony murder”, I will, for the sake of consistency, use that expression in this judgment.  
      
       
     210 During the course of the summing up, his Honour provided the jury with written directions which embraced the various alternatives of criminal liability posited by the Crown. Counsel for all parties agreed to the form of the written directions. Those directions are in the following terms: -

      REGINA v Joshua Jay REMILTON 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
     1 HIDDEN J: This is an appeal by the Crown against what is said to be the inadequacy of sentences passed upon the respondent by Karpin DCJ following his pleading guilty to charges of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm, common assault and neglecting to provide adequate care for a child, the last offence being an offence under s 26 of the Child Care and Protection Act 1987. The last offence was in fact on a Form 1 and her Honour took it into account when passing sentence on the charge of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm.2 On that first charge her Honour sentenced the respondent to a suspended sentence of imprisonment for two years with a bond, accompanied by certain conditions to which it will be necessary to return. On the charge of common assault her Honour directed the respondent to enter into a good behaviour bond for three years, again with certain conditions.3 The facts of this distressing case were adequately summarised by her Honour in her remarks on sentence as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         ""The prisoner and his defacto wife are the parents of two children, a son aged two at the time of these events and the victim, a daughter born on 24 June 2000 and accordingly about eight weeks old at the relevant time. 
         
        
        
         
         On 27 August the baby had an unsettled night. The mother gave the care of the child to the prisoner in order to get some sleep. She heard the child crying. After about an hour the prisoner brought the baby to her and she says threw the baby to her. She immediately noticed that there was severe bruising on the child's face which had not been there when she placed the child in its bassinette some time earlier. The prisoner denied any knowledge as to how the bruising had occurred. 
         
        
        
         
         The following day the child's mother took the baby to a doctor complaining that the child was not feeding well and was irritable. The doctor could find nothing wrong. The next day, however, the child's condition was observed by a family support worker who arranged for her to be examined by a doctor, as a consequence of which a notification was made to the Department of Community Services. 
         
        
        
         
         The support worker returned to the family home with the mother and child where she spoke to the prisoner about the bruising on the child. He admitted hitting the baby in the stomach and he admitted that he had hit the baby very hard on the head. When the prisoner was interviewed by police he confirmed his admissions. He said that his partner was speaking to him in a denigrating fashion which upset him. He was trying to settle the baby who would not stop crying. He felt frustrated and angry. He punched the child in the stomach. He noticed that the punch appeared to wind her which indicates that it was a blow of considerable force. This blow constitutes the charge of common assault. 
         
        
        
         
         Not surprisingly the child continued to cry and would not settle. This increased the prisoner's sense of anger and frustration. He felt agitated as a consequence of the insulting remarks his defacto wife was making. He said that he then lost it. He struck the child very hard across the head, firstly with a forehand blow and then immediately afterward with a backhand blow. He said that the child screamed when he hit her and he hit her again to shut her up. He was sufficiently concerned about what he had done to check if she was still breathing when he returned her to the crib. He also wondered if he had caused brain damage to her. The blows to the head constitute the first count in the indictment. 
         
        
        
         
         The prisoner, when challenged by his wife, denied that he knew the causes of the child's bruising. He did not tell her or anyone of the vicious attack on the child because he was concerned that he would be put out of the house if he admitted what he had done. Accordingly, no steps were taken by him to seek help for the child. That constitutes the offence on the Form 1. 
         
        
        
         
         When the child was medically examined she was found to have facial bruising and skull fractures consistent with the account above given by the prisoner. The skeletal survey disclosed a complex fracture of the right parietal bone. The skeletal survey disclosed a number of other serious injuries to the child consistent with non-accidental injury. Those are not, however, the subject of any charges before the Court, nor can it be determined how those arose and I set those aside. 
         
        
        
         
         Despite the injuries occasioned by the prisoner's conduct the report from the Children's Hospital indicates that the child now appears to be developing within normal parameters. She is closely supervised and monitored. She lives with her mother and the prisoner has no access to her, although he has brief access to the older child."" 
         
        
       
     4 In many ways the prisoner's subjective case is no less distressing. He was 25 years old at the time of sentence and had no prior convictions. He had the benefit of a satisfactory work history and the evidence disclosed him to have been an honest and hard worker.5 His family background, however, was characterised by violence. He witnessed the violence of his father, directed usually at his mother. His parents separated and his mother re-married. Unfortunately, things did not improve at all. His step-father also visited violence upon his mother, on some occasions of an extreme nature. The step-father was also verbally and physically abusive of the respondent himself.6 Her Honour observed that the respondent had consistently witnessed male violence as a normal experience. His relationship with the mother of the child/victim was beset by difficulties from the outset. It seems that the unfortunate woman had problems of her own. She became pregnant very soon after the relationship began. Her Honour had the benefit of reports from the Probation and Parole Service, from a psychiatrist and from the respondent's general practitioner. The probation officer observed that the respondent and his defacto wife were barely able to care for themselves, let alone take on the mutual responsibility of children.7 Her Honour had regard to the fact that the prisoner had since undertaken counselling and was satisfied that he was genuinely remorseful. She observed him to be visibly distressed during the sentence proceedings and I might say I have observed him to be so in this Court this morning. Her Honour commented upon his obvious vulnerability in the prison system if he were to face a sentence of full-time custody.8 Her Honour assessed the case in this way: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Clearly his actions were not premeditated. He is a somewhat simple young man who, unfortunately, has had a whole childhood of exposure to domestic violence and has himself been the victim of physical and verbal abuse. He has a problem controlling his temper when tired and frustrated and I accept that he had in fact been working and helping with the care of the children. 
         
        
        
         
         All the objective signs are that he was endeavouring to meet the demands of fatherhood as best he could. In the event he failed miserably in relation to his baby daughter. None of the difficulties with which he was faced can possibly provide an excuse for the prisoner's conduct. Those facts do, however, place it in the correct context."" 
         
        
       
     9 Her Honour's remarks on sentence, if I may respectfully say so, were crafted very carefully and had regard to all relevant matters. Her Honour expressed in the clearest terms the seriousness of the offences for which the respondent stood for sentence, referring to the decision of this Court in R v Pitcher (CCA, unreported, 19 February 1996.)10 Shortly put, the Crown's submissions in this Court are that the sentences and, in particular, the two year suspended sentence, are manifestly inadequate, notwithstanding the significant subjective case the respondent was able to make out, and that they failed to reflect the objective seriousness of the offences and the need for deterrence, both particular and more especially general.11 I can see the force of those submissions but her Honour was confronted with what she rightly described as a tragic and difficult case. This is not the occasion to express in any authoritative way the position which the suspended sentence occupies in the hierarchy of sentencing options now available in this State. It is sufficient to say that such a disposition necessarily arises from the conclusion that a custodial sentence is appropriate on the fact of it but, for reasons emerging from the evidence, ought to be suspended. The suspended sentence does have a denunciatory effect and certainly some deterrent effect, in my view.12 Notwithstanding the very serious nature of these offences and in particular the offence to which the suspended sentence was attached, I am not persuaded that her Honour fell into error in approaching this unusual case in the way she did.13 The combination of the suspended sentence and the s 9 bond was such as to mark the seriousness of the crimes whilst promoting the rehabilitation of this respondent.14 That said there does appear to me to be a technical difficulty with the way her Honour went about passing the suspended sentence. Having announced that the sentence on the first count would be imprisonment for two years her Honour suspended it upon certain conditions being as follows: firstly, that the respondent accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service; secondly, that he report to that service within a certain specified time and, thirdly, and this is the condition which troubles me, that he commit no further offences of violence and no criminal offences for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment exceeding 12 months.15 It appears to me that the combined effect of ss 12 and 95 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is that when a sentence is suspended the offender must be directed to enter into a bond and that bond must contain the conditions required by s 95. One of those essential conditions is that the offender be of good behaviour, which is an all embracing prohibition of committing any offence of any nature and whatever penalty it might carry.16 In those circumstances it seems to me that it is necessary for that reason alone to allow the appeal for the purpose of altering the conditions attaching to the suspended sentence.17 Having done so, I am still of the view that the suspended sentence should date from the date upon which her Honour imposed it, being 24 August 2001.18 Accordingly, the orders I propose are these. The appeal is allowed in respect of the sentence passed on the first count and in lieu of that sentence I would sentence the respondent to imprisonment for two years, to date from 24 August 2001, but I would suspend that sentence and direct him to enter into a bond for the term of the sentence containing the following conditions:19 firstly, that he appear before this Court if called on to do so at any time during the term of the bond; 20 secondly, that he be of good behaviour;21 thirdly, that he inform the Registrar of this Court of any change in his residential address;22 fourthly, that he accept the supervision and guidance of the Probation and Parole Service during the period of the bond.23 I would otherwise dismiss the appeal.24 STEIN JA: I agree with the judgment of Hidden J and with the orders which he proposes. It is, as his Honour has said, a distressing case and so much was made very plain by her Honour, the sentencing judge's careful reasons on sentence.25 The offence is indeed a grave one and her Honour's ""...reservations that an apparently non-custodial sentence does not adequately reflect the gravity of the offending..."" are understandable and shared by me. However, I can detect no error by her Honour which would lead this Court to uphold the Crown appeal, other than in the manner demonstrated by Hidden J.26 The sentences which her Honour passed on the respondent were open to her and within the sentencing discretion. The main thrust of the Crown's submission on the appeal is that the sentence passed, a suspended sentence, did not include any real aspect of general deterrence. It seems to me the law says otherwise although I can understand the views of who which contend that it does not.27 I agree with Hidden J.28 HOWIE J: This case throws up in sharp relief the difficulties of making sense of the structure of the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in respect of the options available to a sentencing Court. In particular it raises the question of where in the hierarchy of sentencing options a suspended sentence stands.29 Neither the philosophy that I can perceive behind the Act or the structure of the provisions of the Act assists in the answer to the conundrum highlighted by this case in which her Honour came to the view that other non-custodial options or alternatives to full-time custody would not adequately reflect the objective seriousness of this offence but that a suspended sentence would.30 In coming to the view that no non-custodial option or alternative full-time custody would reflect the seriousness of the offence committed by the respondent her Honour was, with respect, undoubtedly correct. Her Honour therefore determined that a sentence of imprisonment was the only sentence that could be imposed but suspended it under s 12 of the Act.31 As has been indicated by the Presiding Judge the Crown's principal complaint is that the sentence imposed had no effective general deterrent component. The Crown, however, conceded that had her Honour imposed what appears to be a less serious sentence under the provisions of the Act, such as community service or periodic detention, an element, however light, of general deterrence would have been reflected in the sentence.32 The Crown's submission was that this Gordian knot of sentencing options should be broken by the imposition of a full-time custodial sentence in this particular case.33 In my view the sentence imposed by her Honour was, assuming that a suspended sentence is a sentencing option higher in the hierarchy than either periodic detention or home detention, at the very bottom of the available sentencing discretion for such a serious offence as that which was before her Honour.34 I doubt that had I been the sentencing judge that I would have imposed such a sentence but that is not the question for this Court. The result in this case in my view should be seen as more a reflection of the principle of double jeopardy in Crown appeals and the exercise of this Court's wide discretion to reject a Crown appeal even though the sentence might otherwise appear to be manifestly inadequate, rather than an endorsement of the sentence imposed by her Honour as an appropriate way to dispose of the offences that were before her.35 I agree therefore that the appeal should be dismissed other than for the technical reasons given by his Honour Hidden J which require this Court to re-impose the sentence in effect that her Honour imposed on the respondent.36 STEIN JA: The orders of the Court will be as announced by Hidden J.

     THURSDAY 6 DECEMBER 2001 
      
      REGINA v RADWIN EL HASSAN 
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
       
     1 STEIN JA: The Court is in a position to proceed to judgment now and I will ask Justice Howie to deliver the first judgment of the Court. 
      
       
     2 HOWIE J: This is an application for leave to appeal under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act in respect of an interlocutory judgment of McGuire DCJ. The applicant was indicted before his Honour on a charge that without reasonable excuse he attempted to obtain possession of a commercial quantity of cocaine. The offence charged is contrary to s233B(1)(c) of the Customs Act (Cth). The trial of the applicant and that of an alleged co-offender was to commence before his Honour on 23 September 2001 but reached only that stage where Judge McGuire had ruled on a number of pre-trial issues one of which gives rise to the present application. For reasons which is unnecessary to recount, the trial will not now proceed this year and apparently not before Judge McGuire. 
      
       
     3 The issue raised by the application is a very narrow one. It concerns the elements of the offence with which the applicant has been charged. Put simply the matter for determination is whether the Crown is required to prove that the applicant intended to take possession of a particular quantity of cocaine, in the present case a commercial quantity, or whether it is sufficient that the applicant be proved to have intended to take possession of cocaine regardless of the amount involved. No point has been raised as to whether the determination made by Judge McGuire as to the elements of the offence charged is an interlocutory judgment or order for the purposes of s 5F, and I am prepared to assume, without deciding, that it is. 
      
       
     4 Notwithstanding that the judge before whom the trial will next be listed would not strictly be bound to determine any of the issues which were before Judge McGuire in the same way as his Honour did, the present matter gives rise to a discrete question of law and comity between judges of the District Court would generally require that the trial judge not embark upon a further consideration of the matter unless there was a good reason to do so. Further, the question raised by the application is fundamental to the issues that will arise on the trial of the applicant and the defence upon which he seeks to rely. If answered unfavourably to the applicant, it may well have some bearing upon the course that the proceedings take thereafter. In my opinion leave should be granted to the applicant to appeal against his Honour’s ruling. 
      
       
     5 The facts upon which his Honour was asked to determine the question can be conveniently taken from the written submissions placed before this Court on behalf of the applicant. They are as follows: 
      
       
        
         
          
         “(a) On 25 April 2000 a machine contained in a crate arrived in Australia from Panama City. It was consigned to a person, Anastasiou, who was ignorant of the fact that the machine contained cocaine. 
          
          
         (b) On 1 May 2000 Customs officers removed 27 kilos of cocaine from the machine, replaced it with an inert substitute powder and effected delivery to Anastasiou’s premises. 
          
          
         (c) Marouf El Hassan (the applicant’s brother) collected the machine and took it to a garage belonging to Chapman for the purposes of cutting into the machine to recover the cocaine. The applicant did not assist in the collection. 
          
          
         (d) On 11 May 2000 the applicant and his brother went to the garage and were recorded discussing how to cut into the machine. 
          
          
         (e) On 12 May 2001, at about 10am, Marouf El Hassan went to the garage alone and along with Chapman cut into the machine and removed the bags of cocaine substitute. Whilst the bags were being removed he spoke with the applicant by phone. He then told Chapman that his brother was due to arrive with [a] person described as his brother’s driver (this person is the applicant’s co-accused Ali Chami). 
          
          
         (f) At about 10.45 am the applicant and Ali Chami arrived at the garage where the machine and the bags of substitute cocaine were in plain view. 
          
          
         (g) Marouf El Hassan showed the applicant (and Ali Chami) the bags and gave one to the applicant. There was discussion about the smell of the powder and when the applicant asked his brother if he had tasted it he said ‘No’ whereupon the applicant tasted it and declared that it was ‘sugar….that it was not gear….that it should be put back’. The applicant also said ‘I reckon they’ve opened them up and taken them out’. 
          
          
         (h) At that point the police entered the garage and the applicant (and others) were arrested.” 
         
        
       
     6 The Crown case is that the applicant was attempting to obtain the cocaine that had been in the machine prior to its discovery by Customs officers. There is no dispute that the cocaine was of a commercial quantity when it was imported. The allegation of an attempt to obtain possession of the cocaine is based upon the fact that the commercial quantity of cocaine was no longer in the machine at the time when the applicant and others became involved in the removal of the drug that they believed was there. 
      
       
     7 Apparently the applicant’s defence to the charge is that he intended only to obtain possession of a quantity of the cocaine for his own personal use. It is said that this would be an amount substantially less than both the amount discovered and removed by Customs officers from the machine, being 27 kilograms, and the commercial quantity provided for in Schedule IV of the Customs Act, being 2 kilograms. The applicant complains that he is unable to plead guilty to the offence because he denies intending to take possession of a commercial quantity of cocaine. He says that he is unable, therefore, to obtain the benefit of an early plea. 
      
       
     8 Judge McGuire, relying upon the High Court authorities of Kingswell v The Queen (1985) 159 CLR 264, The Queen v Meaton (1986) 160 CLR 359, and most recently Cheng v The Queen (2000) 203 CLR 248 held that, although the Crown was required to prove that the drug imported was not less than a commercial quantity, the applicant’s state of mind as to the quantity of the drug of which he attempted to obtain possession was not a question for the jury. 
      
       
     9 Before this Court Ms Fullerton SC who appears for the applicant has argued that, in applying those decisions to the present charge under s233B(1)(c), his Honour failed to appreciate two facts which seem to be decisive and limit the authority of those decisions: they are that the charge was one of attempt to take possession of the drug and that the attempt was impossible to complete because the drug was no longer present in the machine. Ms Fullerton submits that in such a case, the quantity of the narcotic goods involved is “directly related to the intention to which the relevant conduct is directed, and must be proved as an element of the offence”. She relies for support for that proposition on the decision of this Court in R v Mai (1992) 26 NSWLR 371 at 381G-382B. 
      
       
     10 Section 233B is relevantly as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         (1) Any person who: 
          
         ……. 
          
           
           (c) without reasonable excuse (proof whereof shall lie upon him) has in his possession, or attempts to obtain possession of, any prohibited imports to which this section applies which have been imported into Australia in contravention of this Act;  
           
          
         …… 
          
          
         shall be guilty of an offence. 
          
         (1A) On the prosecution of a person for an offence against the last preceding sub-section, being an offence to which paragraph (c) of that sub-section applies, it is not necessary for the prosecution to prove that the person knew that the goods in his possession or of which he attempted to obtain possession had been imported into Australia in contravention of this Act, but it is a defence if the person proves that he did not know that the goods in his possession or of which he attempted to obtain possession had been imported into Australia on contravention of this Act. 
          
         (1C) Any defence for which provision is made under either of the last 2 preceding sub-sections in relation to an offence does not limit any defence otherwise available to the person charged. 
          
         (2) The prohibited imports to which this section applies are prohibited imports that are narcotic goods…. 
          
         (3) A person who is guilty of an offence against sub-section (1) of this section is punishable upon conviction as provided by section 235…. 
          
         
        
       
     11 Section 235 of the Act contains provisions dealing with the maximum penalty prescribed for an offence under s 233B. It relevantly provides: 
      
       
        
         
         (1) 
         ….. 
          
         (2) Subject to sub-sections (3) and (7), where: 
          
           
           (a) a person commits an offence against sub-section 231(1), section 233A or sub-section 233B(1); and 
            
           (b) the offence is an offence that is punishable as provided by this section, 
           
          
         the penalty applicable to the offence is: 
          
           
           (c) where the Court is satisfied: 
            
             
             (i) that the narcotic goods in relation to which the offence was committed: 
              
               
               (A) are a narcotic substance in respect of which there is a commercial quantity applicable; and 
                
               (B) consist of a quantity of that substance that is not less than that commercial quantity; or 
               
              
             
            
           …. 
           
          
         a fine not exceeding $750,000 or imprisonment for life, or both or for such period as the Court thinks appropriate;. 
          
         ….. 
         
        
       
     12 As was noted in the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ in Cheng at [25] in relation to an offence under s 233B(1)(d) of being knowingly concerned in the importation into Australia of prohibited imports, an offence under s 233B(1)(c) does not require that a person have knowledge of the amount of the prohibited import which he possesses or attempts to possess before he can be convicted of the offence set out in the section. An offence is committed under paragraph (c) if the person, without reasonable excuse, attempts to obtain prohibited imports to which the section applies, being in the present case narcotic goods. There is nothing in any of the provisions of s 233B that refers to an amount of narcotic goods. No mention is made of quantities until one comes to s 235. 
      
       
     13 It was held by five Justices in Cheng that knowledge or belief of the quantity of the narcotic goods the subject of an offence under s 233B(1)(d) was not an element of the offence created by that section. The majority of the Court, applying Meaton was of the view that s 235 created no offence in relation to a particular quantity of narcotic mentioned in the section but that the section was merely prescribing the maximum penalty in relation to an offence under s 233B depending upon the quantity of the narcotic goods involved in the offence and their nature. Only Justices Gaudron and Kirby were of the opinion that either a combination of the two sections (per Gaudron J) or the terms of s 235 alone (per Kirby J) created discrete offences depending upon the amount of the narcotic goods alleged. The outstanding issue left unresolved by the decision in Cheng was the validity of s 235 in light of s 80 of The Constitution and the decision in Kingswell. That issue was further considered in the recent decision of Cheung v The Queen [2001] HCA 67. 
      
       
     14 It would seem to me that, on the face of it, the reasoning of the majority of the High Court in Cheng in relation to an offence under s 233B(1)(d) should apply with equal force to any of the offences contained in the section and in particular to an offence under s 233B(1)(c). I see no reason in logical or legal principle to hold that the mental element relevant to the existence of narcotic goods, or their nature or quantity, should vary depending upon what particular category of offence under s 233B is being considered. One might ask rhetorically why Parliament should have intended such a result? This is particularly so in respect of an offence under s 233B(1)(c), where it is unnecessary for the Crown to prove that the accused knew that the narcotic goods in his possession, or in respect of which he attempts to obtain possession, had been imported. 
      
       
     15 In He Kaw Teh v The Queen (1985) 157 CLR 523 at 584-586 Brennan J held that for an offence under s 233B(1)(b) and (c) it is sufficient if the Crown proves that the accused knew or believed of the existence of narcotic goods even if he was unaware of the nature of the narcotic goods. The decision in Kural v The Queen (1987) 162 CLR 502 proceeds on the same basis. The maximum penalty prescribed under s 235 differs depending upon whether the narcotic goods were cannabis or not. Whether the quantity of narcotic goods amounts to a commercial or trafficable quantity and, therefore, what maximum penalty is applicable to the offence committed depends upon the nature of the narcotic goods. However, notwithstanding that the nature of the narcotic goods imported can have a very significant impact upon the sentence to which the offender is liable, proof of knowledge or belief of the nature of the narcotic goods is not required for proof of an offence under the section. If the accused’s knowledge of the nature of the narcotic goods imported is irrelevant to proof of an offence under s 233B(1)(c) or the maximum penalty applicable, I find it difficult to understand why the Crown should be required to prove knowledge or belief of the amount of the narcotic goods imported. 
      
       
     16 However, the argument in support of the applicant is that, because the offence alleged in the present case is an attempt committed in circumstances in which it was impossible to perform the completed offence, the situation is different and the elements of the offence change so that the Crown is required to prove the knowledge or belief of the accused as to the quantity of the drug which had been imported and in respect of which he sought to obtain possession. Again I confess that I do not understand why such a result should follow as a matter of logic or policy. Why, I ask myself, should it matter on the issue of the accused’s guilt of an offence under the section that the Customs officers intercepted the drug and removed it before the accused could obtain possession of it? Would it be relevant that there was some other obstacle in the way of the accused obtaining possession of the narcotic goods which had been imported, for example if the narcotic goods were in the possession of a Custom’s officer who never intended that the accused would obtain them even though the accused did all that was necessary on his part to come into possession of them? What if the drugs had been lost or inadvertently destroyed by the importing agency after being imported but before the accused could collect them? 
      
       
     17 But the criminal law does not always work with logical precision and the interaction of statute and the common law sometimes produces surprising or at least unexpected results. It is, therefore, necessary to consider in some detail what is said to be the authority for the result for which the applicant contends: the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL (as he then was) in Mai. 
      
       
     18 That was an appeal from a conviction for offences under the very same provision as is presently being considered. The appellant Mai was convicted of two offences, one of being in possession of portion of the drug imported and an offence of attempting to obtain possession of some other part of the drug. Unlike the applicant before the Court, in respect of the charge of attempt to obtain possession Mai had been charged with attempting to obtain possession of an identifiable part of the heroin imported. It is necessary to briefly refer to the facts to understand the charges and this Court’s decision. The charge of possession arose from the discovery by Federal police of thirty blocks of heroin in a suitcase that had arrived by air as unaccompanied luggage. The police substituted for those blocks thirty blocks of plaster of paris, some of which contained a small amount of heroin as a controlled delivery. The suitcase was left at the airport in the hope that someone would collect it, but no one did. It was then taken to a room in a motel at Ultimo but again it was not collected. It was then moved to a motel at Bondi. 
      
       
     19 A man named Tran eventually came to the room at that motel and attempted unsuccessfully to open the suitcase. He then left the room and spoke to Mai. Tran then returned to the room, picked up the suitcase and took it to a motor vehicle in the boot of which he placed the suitcase. When he was arrested some time later, a number of the blocks were found in a sports bag in the vehicle, two of the blocks containing a small amount of the heroin actually imported. The suitcase was found in the premises of a former girlfriend of Mai, where he had resided at one time. There was other evidence linking Mai with the suitcase. Mai was later arrested and found to have one of the substitute blocks in his possession. That block contained no heroin at all. However, his possession of that block was the basis of the charge of attempting to obtain possession of the block of heroin for which the block of plaster of paris had been substituted. The offence charged in respect of this block was an attempt to obtain possession of a quantity of narcotic goods being not less than the trafficable quantity applicable to heroin. Mai was convicted of that offence. He was also charged with possession of the thirty blocks that had been placed in the suitcase by police based upon a common purpose to possess them with Tran. He was also convicted of that offence. 
      
       
     20 On appeal, Mai argued that he could not lawfully be convicted of attempt to have possession of narcotic goods in a situation where it was physically impossible for him to have obtained possession of those goods. The argument with which this Court was principally concerned was whether the decision of the House of Lords in Haughton v Smith [1975] AC 476 should be applied to an offence under the Customs Act. It is unnecessary to repeat the arguments that led the Court to hold that it should not follow the House of Lords but rather should apply decisions of the Full Court of Victoria and the Court of Criminal Appeal of Western Australia in Britten v Alpogut [1987] VR 929 and Lee (1990) 47 A Crim R 187. Mai has frequently been applied in this State and its correctness is not presently in doubt. 
      
       
     21 Hunt CJ at CL with whom the other members of the Court agreed stated (at 381G-382C): 
      
       
        
         
         “I interpret the law laid down in  
         Britten v Alpogut 
          (and adopted in  
         R v Lee 
         ), when applied to the general law of attempt, as being that, in circumstances where it is in fact physically impossible for the accused to commit a particular crime, an attempt to commit that crime has nevertheless been proved if the Crown establishes: 
          
          
         (i) that the accused intended to do the acts with the relevant state of mind which together would comprise the intended crime ( 
         that is, if the facts and circumstances had been as he believed them to be, he would have committed that crime) 
         , and 
          
          
         (ii) that, with that intention, he did some act towards the commission of that crime which went beyond mere preparation and which cannot reasonably be regarded as having any purpose other than the commission of that crime. 
          
          
         Thus, it was held in  
         Britten v Alpogut 
          that a person who was in possession of a substance when he arrives in Australia which he believed was a prohibited import, but which was in fact another substance which was not prohibited, is guilty of an attempt to import a prohibited import into Australia, contrary to s 233B(1)(b). And it was held in  
         R v Lee 
          that a person who is in possession of a small quantity of heroin in a parcel addressed to him and sent from overseas is guilty of attempting to obtain possession of the substantial quantity of heroin which he believed the parcel contained, contrary to s 233B(1)(c) of the  
         Customs Act 1901 (Cth) 
         , notwithstanding that the parcel had been intercepted by the authorities and a major portion of the heroin originally in the parcel had been removed before its delivery to him. In each case, the fact that it was physically impossible for the accused to achieve the particular crime which he had intended to commit was irrelevant.”  
         
        
       
     22 It is within this passage that the applicant finds support for the argument placed both before Judge McGuire and this Court. In particular the applicant relies upon the passage that I have underlined. The argument is, as I understand it, that in the exceptional case of a charge of attempting to take possession of narcotic goods where it is in fact impossible to take possession of them, the Crown has to prove knowledge or belief on the part of the accused of not only the existence of the narcotic goods sought to be obtained, but also the quantity of them. I presume that to take the argument to its logical conclusion, although it was unnecessary in the present case for counsel for the applicant to do so, the Crown must also prove knowledge or belief in the accused of the nature of the narcotic goods imported. 
      
       
     23 In my opinion the argument is misconceived. It misunderstands what Justice Hunt meant in that part of his judgment that I have underlined. At Roman numeral one his Honour was indicating that, in order to prove an attempt in the situation where, for whatever reason, the accused could not complete the act attempted, the Crown had to prove that the accused had intended to do the acts which would have amounted to the commission of the offence charged with the relevant state of mind required for the commission of the completed offence: in Mai the relevant state of mind was knowledge or belief that the substance to be possessed was narcotic goods and an intention to obtain possession of them. In Britten v Alpogut the relevant state of mind was that the accused intended to import what was known by him to be a prohibited import. The relevant state of mind did not include in either case knowledge or belief of either the nature of the narcotic goods or their quantity. 
      
       
     24 In my view the words in parenthesis in the passage from Mai I have quoted above were not intended to restrict or refine in any way the words preceding them. In particular, they were not intended to make necessary for the proof of the crime charged that which was otherwise irrelevant. They were inserted to make clear what should have been obvious: that in a case where there were no narcotic goods present (as was the case in both Britten v Alpogut and in the attempt charge in Mai) the inquiry as to the relevant state of mind is conducted in the context of the facts and circumstances as the accused believed them to be and not as they actually existed. It is clear to my mind that the word “relevant” should be implied before the words “facts and circumstances” because facts and circumstances which have no bearing upon the issue of the accused’s guilt of “that crime”, that is the intended crime, are irrelevant. 
      
       
     25 The argument for the applicant is in my view an attempt to resuscitate what Murphy J in Britten v Alpogut referred to as the heresy in Haughton v Smith: a change of focus in attempt cases from a consideration of the intention of the accused to an inquiry into the ultimate consequence of the acts committed by him. The argument suggests that the criminality of the accused’s intention can be affected by facts of which he knows nothing. As was explained in Britten v Alpogut, that line of reasoning is fallacious. Since Britten v Alpogut there has never been, if there ever was, a difference in the mental element for an offence under s233B depending upon whether or not the acts committed did result, or could have resulted, in the commission of an offence under the Act. Nor in my view does the necessary mental element depend upon whether the substantive offence or attempted offence has been charged. In Britten v Alpogut the respondent in that case was guilty of the offence under s 233B(1)(b) even though what he imported were not in fact narcotic goods. It was sufficient that he committed the act of importation with the necessary mental element, being an intention to import something that was a prohibited import. 
      
       
     26 The fact that Customs officers or Federal agents remove the drug after its importation cannot possibly affect the necessary mental element to be proved for an offence under s 233B. That fact is irrelevant to any legal issue arising at the trial of a person under the section. In the present case the relevant mental element to be proved by the Crown is an intention on the part of the applicant to take possession of something that he knew or believed to be narcotic goods. His knowledge or belief in either the nature of the narcotic goods or its quantity is irrelevant to the proof of the offence charged. Nor is his knowledge or belief as to the quantity of the drug a necessary condition to expose him to the penalty provided under s235 in respect of the narcotic goods imported, that is life imprisonment; Cheng at [25]. In my view the statement in the charge of what has been, probably imprecisely, called a circumstance of aggravation makes no difference to the mental element to be proved by the Crown. 
      
       
     27 It follows that in my view the determination of Judge McGuire as to the essential elements of the offence with which the applicant has been charged was correct and the appeal should be dismissed. It was unnecessary for the present appeal to determine whether his Honour was also correct in finding that the Crown had to prove that the drugs imported were of not less than the commercial quantity. It should not be taken that this judgment holds that his Honour was correct in coming to that view. 
      
       
     28 I propose that the application for leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed. 
      
       
     29 STEIN JA: I agree. 
      
       
     30 HIDDEN J: I agree. 
      
       
     31 STEIN JA: Accordingly, the orders of the Court will be, leave to appeal is granted but the appeal is dismissed.

The events in question were said to have occurred in 1979 or 1980 when the complainant was about nine. The complainant said that she had complained of the events to her husband in 1991 and to the police in 1995. The appellant appealed against both his convictions and the respective sentences. Held by Heydon JA (Wood CJ at CL and Carruthers AJ concurring), allowing the appeal, quashing the convictions and ordering a new trial: 1. The trial judge erred in law in failing to properly or adequately direct the jury regarding the delay in complaint.a. The trial judge ought to have mentioned the forensic difficulties that the delay in complaint caused to the appellant, but he did not do so.  
      
       
        
         
          
          “…if delay causes… forensic prejudice to the accused in the particular circumstances…a warning must be given”.

     c. The content of the trial judge’s warning was inadequate. He mentioned the weaknesses in the complainant’s evidence and the possible impact of delay on recollection. However, he did not warn about the difficulties that delay might have created for the accused in attempting to address the allegations.

       2. The trial judge did not err in his directions about use of the complainant’s evidence generally.  
       
     a. When the trial judge directed the jury carefully to scrutinise the complainant’s evidence, he mentioned that such a direction was given in all cases where the Crown case relied on the evidence of one witness. This did not understate the importance of the direction, but instead demonstrated its universal importance. 
      
       
        
        R v Roddom  
        [2001] NSWCCA 168, discussed. 
         
        
       
     3. The trial judge did not misdirect the jury in relation to intent.a. The trial judge’s mistake about the time of day/night of the events was a trivial slip. Whether the complainant was mistaken about her age did not affect the merits of the trial judge’s direction. 
      
       
       b. Although the complainant did not say in terms that she thought the appellant was going to penetrate her, there was a passage of the complainant’s evidence which was to that substantive effect. If the jury accepted that evidence, they could have inferred that the appellant intended to have sexual intercourse without consent.  
       
      
      
       
       4. The trial judge did not err in his observation on whether the same verdict ought to be brought in on each count. 
       
     a. The passage complained of contradicts the theoretical possibility  
      
       
        
        that the appellant could be believed on one count and not the other. However, the correct theoretical position is stated in the preceding and following passages, and is only a theoretical position. No request for redirection was made at trial. 
        
       
      5. The trial judge did not err in relation to his direction on lies by the accused and/or defence witnesses. 
      
       
       a. The trial judge was dealing with “credibility lies” rather than “consciousness of guilt lies”. Therefore, compliance with  
       Zoneff v The Queen  
       (2000) 200 CLR 234 was sufficient and a direction was not required in accordance with  
       Edwards v The Queen  
       (1993) 178 CLR 193. 
       
      6. The verdicts of the jury were not unreasonable, unsafe or unsatisfactory. The verdicts did not cause a miscarriage of justice within the meaning of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. a. The evidence admitted at the trial could not be said to contain discrepancies, display inadequacies, be tainted or otherwise lack probative force in such a way that it could be concluded on appeal, despite making allowances for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, that there was a significant possibility that an innocent person was convicted.  
      
       
        
        M v R  
        (1994) 181 CLR 487, applied.  
        
       
     b. The Crown case was neither particularly weak nor particularly strong. Although the Crown case alleged events that happened to a young child in the past, of which there was only weak corroboration, there was nothing inherently implausible or self-contradictory in the complainant’s allegations.  7. The appeal should not be dismissed under the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, which allows an appeal to be dismissed when “no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred”. a. The proviso can be applied when the error is not so fundamental as to have caused the trial to miscarry so far as hardly to be a trial at all, and the conviction was “inevitable”, so that the appellant has not lost a chance of acquittal fairly open to him. 
      
       
        
        Glennon v R  
        (1994) 119 ALR 706, applied. 
        
       
     b. In this case, the trial judge’s error (failing to properly or adequately direct the jury in respect of the delay in complaint), was not “fundamental” in the necessary sense. However, if the jury had been given the proper warning regarding delay in complaint and its effect on the appellant’s forensic position, they may have experienced a reasonable doubt. Hence, the conviction of the appellant was not “inevitable”.  8. A new trial should be ordered under s 8 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, rather than an acquittal.a. It is likely that a new trial will neither be lengthy nor complex. The appellant has been able to benefit from a technical error in directions by the trial judge, and his counsel at trial did not seek the correct direction. The offences charged are of a serious and prevalent type. The appellant has not served any of the relevant sentences because he has been serving other sentences. There is no possibility of the prosecution supplementing a factually defective case.

      1. The appeal is allowed. 2. The convictions are quashed. 3. A new trial is ordered.IN THE COURT OFCRIMINAL APPEAL

      Judgment 
      
     1 HEYDON JA:  
      
       
      Background 
       
      The appellant was tried before Gibson DCJ and a jury on 7-9 December 1998 on two counts, one of indecent assault and one of attempted rape. He was convicted on both counts. He was sentenced to a fixed term of two years in relation to the first conviction. By reason of the fact that the appellant was already serving a sentence of imprisonment, that fixed term was to commence on 15 May 2004.

        A. Yes, standing out the front of Nan and Pop’s. 
         
         
        Q. When you say he was standing out the front, was he doing anything? 
         
         
        A. Yes, calling her back with his finger.” 
         
         
        
       
     6 In cross-examination she adhered to her evidence in chief. She also said that ten years earlier she had asked the complainant whether she had been crying because the appellant had “touched” her, to which the answer was affirmative.  
     7 The complainant’s ex husband confirmed the complainant’s evidence of complaint to him. Detective Senior Constable Ogilvy gave evidence that after the complainant had given him a statement in 1995, he went to a house in Cobar. The appellant came out of it. Detective Senior Constable Ogilvy’s evidence was: 
      
       
        
        “I said, ‘I am Detective Ogilvy and this is Detective Garner. I believe you know why we are here. I wish to speak to you at the police station about these things.’ He said, ‘Can I drive down myself?’ I said, ‘Detective Garner can go with you and I will follow.’ 
         
         
        At the Cobar Police Station, in the sergeant’s office, I spoke with the accused. I said, ‘… I wish to speak with you about allegations of assaults of a sexual nature made against you. I want you to understand you are not obliged to say anything unless you wish as anything you do say may later be used in evidence, do you understand that?’ He said, ‘Yeah. What is the name of the girl? It’s [the complainant’s christian name].’ I said, ‘[the complainant’s name]?’ He said, ‘Well why does she wait all this time? Why didn’t she do something then? I never did anything with her. I haven’t done anything’.”  
         
        
       
     8 The appellant gave evidence and denied the complainant’s allegations. Three of the appellant’s sisters said that in the periods in which they had lived in the complainant’s grandparents’ house there never was an occasion on which an adult female was not in the house. The appellant’s brother gave evidence that he could not recall an occasion when the appellant was alone in the house. 
      
       
      Grounds 1 and 2: directions on lack of complaint and use of the complainant’s evidence 
       
       
      The grounds of appeal 
     9 These grounds were: 
      
       
       1. His Honour erred in law in misdirecting and/or failing to direct adequately or properly the jury in respect of the delay in complaint. 
        
       2. His Honour erred in law in misdirecting and/or failing to direct the jury adequately or properly as to the evidence of the complainant. 
       
      The appellant’s submissions 
     10 The appellant submitted that the trial judge did not give a direction in accordance with Longman v R (1989) 168 CLR 79 at 90-1 “in respect of the fact that the means of testing the complainant’s evidence had been lost”.  
     11 The appellant submitted that the case was similar to R v Roddom [2001] NSWCCA 168. In that case the Court of Criminal Appeal found certain warnings given by the trial judge to have been inadequate. In particular, at [30]-[32] Howie J (with whom Meagher JA and Sully J agreed) pointed out that in Crampton v R (2000) 75 ALJR 133 at [39] Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ had said it followed from Longman v R that it was imperative to give a warning, in appropriate cases, about the effect of delay upon the ability of the accused to test the complainant’s evidence. Howie J said that in relation to one passage in the summing up there was no suggestion that the trial judge had failed to bring to the jury’s attention in a meaningful way the difficulties for the defence caused by the delay. But he said that the trial judge undermined what was there said by referring to the complainant’s reasons for delay. Howie J also criticised the summing up because on each occasion when the trial judge directed the jury to scrutinise the complainant’s evidence with care, the jury was also told that a direction of that type was given in all cases where one person makes an allegation against another. Howie J said at [36]: 
      
       
       “In my view there was a risk in making that comment, or at least in repeating it each time the caution was given, that the jury would minimise the importance of the direction to the particular case before them.” 
       
      (In  
      R v Stewart 
       [2001] NSWCCA 260 at [139] Howie J uttered a dictum to the effect that that view was a view from which he did not retreat.) 
       
     12 In the present case the appellant submitted that the trial judge had committed the last-mentioned error by saying: “I propose to give you a direction that is given, in all cases in which the Crown case does in fact rest on the evidence of one witness.” The appellant also submitted that the trial judge had failed to point out in a meaningful way the difficulties which delay in complaint had caused the defence, contrary to R v Johnston (1998) 45 NSWLR 362 at 375.  
      
       
      The trial judge’s summing up 
     13 The trial judge’s summing up was delivered on 8 December 1998. This was probably before R v Johnston was reported, and it was before Crampton v R and a later relevant case, Doggett v R (2001) 75 ALJR 1290, were decided. Those circumstances may explain the terms of the summing up, but it cannot, of course, prevent the appellant from taking advantage of any error which those terms reveal. 
     14 The relevant part of the summing up was as follows: 
      
       
        
        “In relation to the Crown case it really rests, as has been said by the prosecutor and Counsel for the accused on the evidence of one witness, that is complainant. I propose to give you a direction that is given, in all cases in which the Crown case does in fact rest on the evidence of one witness. It is not given to you in this case because she was a child at the time or because it is a woman or because it is a sex case, it is given to all juries in which the Crown case is dependent upon one witness. 
         
         
        The direction is this. Before you can convict the accused on the evidence of the one witness, in this case the complainant … you must carefully scrutinise and evaluate that evidence in the light of the criticism made of it, in regard to each of the separate charges and if after such careful scrutiny and evaluation you are satisfied that the evidence is truthful, reliable and accurate you can then use that evidence as the basis of a conviction on each or either of those charges. 
         
         
        Now what are the criticisms that are made of it. As I understand it, it is and I will be giving you another warning shortly, that the time that has elapsed because of the incident, the fact that no complaint was made, at any time, by the young child, as she then was to her parents or her sisters or any one at all and when you take that, in the light of the evidence that has been led by the accused and his witnesses to show what the situation was there, that you would have grave doubts concerning the Crown case and that you would not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. You will remember Counsel for the accused outlining these criticisms and I direct you in relation to those criticisms as I say, that you must carefully scrutinise and evaluate that evidence in the light of the criticisms and if after such careful scrutiny and evaluation you are satisfied that the evidence is truthful, reliable and accurate you can use the evidence as the basis of a conviction on each or any of those charges. 
         
         
        Now evidence has been given in this trial of events that are alleged to have occurred in about 1980, some eighteen years ago when the complainant was some ten years of age, her sister was some years younger than that, she was about seven or eight and everyone was eighteen years younger. Time has made it difficult for witnesses to completely recall circumstances and details. Memories can fluctuate and fade over such a period of time, quite honestly as can be seen in nearly all the witnesses called on behalf of the Crown and the accused. As well as perhaps leave scope for the dishonest, if there be any. These matters may lead to a situation in which the evidence may be unreliable for two reasons. One, the age of some of the witnesses, that is the young children at the time who were eighteen years passed and the other, the sheer period of time that has elapsed. 
         (emphasis added) 
         
         
        Both may contribute, I said, you will not ‘may’ not ‘must’ or ‘do’. You should carefully consider the factors that I have mentioned when assessing the evidence and the witnesses and the weight to be given to the evidence of the various witnesses. Now the Crown says in relation to this period of time that you can look at these various memory lapses by various people, but you must come back to one particular thing, as I understand it, that is did the incident take place. Whilst the young girl might forget how old she was he says, exactly how old she was, or the date that it had taken place, or the time of day or what particular part of the year it was. Did the incident take place. Is that something that she would have forgotten in those circumstances. He said she did not forget and you would accept her evidence that the incident did in fact take place. 
         
         
        Counsel for the accused says to you well those periods of time that have elapsed, the age, plus the evidence that has been given by the witnesses on behalf of the accused as to the inability of the accused to have been at any time, alone in the period the Crown have submitted to you, alone with the complainant would raise a doubt in your mind, a serious doubt and one which would require you to bring back a verdict of not guilty. 
         
         
        These are entirely matters for you. It is a matter for you to take into consideration the effect it has on you, the weight these submissions have on you and the warning has on you, is entirely a matter for you. 
         
         
        Now Counsel for the accused has said to you that the complainant at no stage made any complaint to anyone, be it her parents or anyone else and that is true and this is at the time the incident took place or near the time the incident took place. She does not mention it to her sisters, she does not run down and mention it to her parents. He submits to you that and it is the law that you may take into consideration the fact that no complaint was made as going to her discredit as a witness or her unbelievability as a witness. Because you would have expected her, he says, in these circumstances to have made a complaint to somebody and it was not made.  
         
         
        The law also requires me to tell you that the fact that the complainant does not complain immediately or at all does not necessarily mean that the witness was not telling the truth. There may be a good reason for delay or non-complaint and indeed the complainant here, when asked, advanced a reason. She was asked why she did not tell her father and mother, they had been down the hotel drinking and I was frightened what Dad would do. You might remember she said on that occasion. 
         
         
        Now if you are satisfied in relation to those complaints as I say those are matters that you may take into consideration, however, if you are satisfied in relation to this matter that there was no complaint close to the event, you may take that into account as to a lack of credibility as a witness in those maters, whether you do or not is entirely a matter for you.” 
        
       
     15 So far as those passages were criticised for saying that the direction to scrutinise the complainant’s evidence carefully was given in all cases in which the Crown case rested on the evidence of one witness, the criticism in this particular instance fails. That is because, read in context, the direction does not suggest that it was being given as a matter of mere formality. The terms of the direction in no way minimised its importance. Rather the trial judge succeeded in communicating the importance of the direction by stressing its universality. So far as the submission relied on the passage in R v Roddom at [36] to which reference was made above, the relevant observation, which was made in the course of an ex tempore judgment, appears to have been a dictum only. In any event, with respect, it is not correct. To the contrary, there as here, the type of direction given underlined the importance of its subject matter. 
      
       
      The appellant’s suggested direction 
     16 In Singleton v Ffrench (1986) 5 NSWLR 425, an appeal relating to a defamation case tried by jury, McHugh JA said at 440 (Samuels JA concurring): 
      
       
        
        “Counsel for the second defendant did not expressly ask for a direction that the learned judge should direct the jury as to the criteria for determining whether or not the conduct of the defendants was improper or unjustifiable or lacking in bona fides. 
        
       
       
        
        If a party is to rely as a ground of appeal on a misdirection in a summing-up, his counsel must specify at the trial that portion of the summing-up which he requires to be withdrawn. If any further direction is needed, counsel must specify with precision what direction the trial judge should give.” 
        
       
       
      The same duty applies in criminal cases tried by jury. No direction was specified in that manner at the trial in this case. Counsel for the appellant, in the course of the hearing of the appeal, was asked several times what direction the trial judge ought to have given. The answer to the question, on the fifth occasion of asking, was: 
       
       
        
        “PAPAYANNI: … he should have said that the long delay in this case has prevented the accused from having the opportunity of preparing his case properly in that he would have been able to bring witnesses to show if it was on a specific day, or within a short period of time, that he was elsewhere at the time, in the form of an alibi, and that his witnesses, if it had been brought within a short time afterwards, his witnesses’ recollections would have been certain or more certain as to where he was at the particular time, and who was living in the house at the particular time between December 1979 and December 1980, and that although this matter has been held to be not absolutely necessary, that he would have been in the position that he could have brought evidence from his work place in relation to whether he was working, and he could have brought other evidence to show that he was in other places at different times. That is in relation to delay. 
        
       
       
        
        Then in the circumstances the Judge should have said, ‘In the circumstances here, having regard to all the evidence, it would be dangerous to convict unless you were convinced beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant was giving evidence – that her evidence was truthful and accurate – and that the defendant and his witnesses’ explanations, if you come to the conclusion that that was a possible version of the situation at the grandfather’s house, and that there was no opportunity during the period of time between December 1979 and December 1980, if it was a reasonable version that no one else was – if it is a possible version that he was never alone during that period of time, [then] you should acquit.’ 
        
       
       
        
        I would have also dealt with this question of corroboration as not being corroboration. I would have dealt with the situation in relation to the indictment which stated that it was between December 1979 and December 1980, and the complainant’s evidence was that it happened when she was nine years of age or about nine years of age. She was born on 10 May 1969 and therefore if she was nine years of age at the time it was from May 1979 to May 1980, and during that period of time, from December 1979 until May 1980, [C1, C2 and G] were living in the house. 
        
       
       
        
        Then I would have referred to the evidence of the complainant on pages 23 and 24 of the transcript to show that during that period of time those persons were living there, [C1, C2 and G] and that the complainant said that there was no other family in the house at the time that this incident occurred. 
        
       
       
        
        Then I would have referred also to the fact of the alleged corroboration, that the girl [S1], who was born in April 1971, said in relation to this incident that it happened when she was seven years of age. That would have been April 1971 to April 1978, which was not within the period of time that the complainant alleged that this matter happened. 
        
       
       
        
        And that the complainant herself had given evidence at page 23 of the transcript that she had not spoken to anyone else up to 1991 when she spoke to her husband, and that [S1] came forward and said that the complainant had spoken to her ten years after the event, which would in 1988 or 89, complaining in relation to the accused touching her, and her husband had given evidence that the complainant had complained to him in 1991 or about 1991, and that she had told him at that time, that is in the evidence at page 37, that she had not complained to anyone else, which would make [S1’s] evidence a lie. 
        
       
       
        
        And then I would go into the evidence of corroboration as to what she said of the incident, that the complainant said that the incident occurred when the accused had called out to her when the three children were at the park, including herself, and asked them to get a coke, that they had gone up there and – this is what the complainant said – and he then asked somebody to get a coke and the other two had gone down to the hotel to get the coke and she stayed, and that is when the incident occurred. 
        
       
       
        
        The complainant said that she went out on the verandah after the incident and met the two sisters, [S1] and the other one, and they had a coke, and then she walked down to the hotel with them. [S1] gave evidence that she was in the house, the grandparents’ house, when the accused had asked her to go down to the hotel. 
        
       
       
        
        CARRUTHERS AJ: If I could just interrupt, what I was interested to hear from you was, as I said at the outset, what direction or warning you would have asked for in relation to the Longman/Crampton/Doggett line of authorities, and I think you have answered that. 
        
       
       
        
        PAPAYANNI: I would have added all the other parts in relation to what was in common experience and so on. In my submission what they were saying in Longman and Doggett and so on was the fact that a class of witness was abolished, the sexual class of witness of a young person was abolished, and you treat the person – the general warning which would be given in relation to a normal situation, without specifying a particular part. 
        
       
       
        
        If this had been a normal case in relation to an assault or something of that kind, the situation would be then that if there was one witness against one witness the Judge would say to them, ‘As a matter of common sense’ and would address the jury in that case and say even though the law says that you do not have to have corroboration, to put it shortly, as a matter of fact if one person alleges something against another you would look at the situation and ask yourself whether there is any confirmation to show that that person is telling the truth.” 
        
       
     17 Had the trial judge uttered that farrago, the jury would have been placed in a much worse position than they were by the directions actually given.  
      
       
      The history of Longman directions: the pre-Longman period 
     18 It is desirable to examine the history of the so-called “Longman” direction which, it is said, ought to have been given in this case. 
     19 At common law there were certain circumstances in which a warning of the danger of convicting on the evidence of a witness without corroboration was mandatory. One was where accomplice evidence was given. Another was where the witness was a young child. Another was where the witness complained of a sexual offence, at least where the dangers against which the rule was directed existed. If there were indisputable, substantial or ample corroboration, the warning did not have to be given: Kelleher v R (1974) 131 CLR 534 at 541, 546 and 560. The mandatory character of these warnings gradually came to be settled in the course of the 20th century. From about 1970 many jurists and some judges exposed them to much criticism. It was said that the rule, which applied to male victims as well as female, but was generally justified by reference to the latter, who formed and form a much greater proportion of victims than males, was unrealistic in treating the evidence of females as intrinsically unreliable in an absolute, indiscriminate and stereotypical way.  
     20 The legislation of each Australian jurisdiction responded to this criticism by enacting legislation abrogating the rule. 
     21 In New South Wales the initial legislation was s 405C(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, introduced in 1981. It provided: 
      
       
        
        “On the trial of a person for a prescribed sexual offence, the Judge is not required by any rule of law or practice to give, in relation to any offence of which the person is liable to be convicted on the charge for the prescribed sexual offence, a warning to the jury to the effect that it is unsafe to convict a person on the uncorroborated evidence of the person upon whom the offence is alleged to have been committed.” 
        
       
       
      This Court described the position established by s 405C(2) as follows in  
      R v Murray 
       (1987) 11 NSWLR 12 at 19 (a passage approved by Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Kirby, Hayne and Callinan JJ in  
      Robinson v R 
       (1999) 197 CLR 162 at [21]): 
       
       
        
        “Section 405C(2) has brought about the result that women are no longer, in the eyes of the law, to be put before the juries as persons whose evidence requires corroboration before it is safe to act upon it. That concept which has been in the law for a long time has now gone. That, of course, does not mean that a judge cannot draw attention to the absence of corroborating testimony from witnesses who are shown by the evidence to have been present and able to offer corroboration of the girl’s story, if it were true, nor does it preclude the judge from making such observations as he considers ought to be made about the credibility of the complainant’s evidence, but always with the proviso, of course, that he must make it clear to the jury that those are his opinions and that the weight to be given to the testimony of the women is entirely a matter for the jury. The fact that a judge does not comment upon the absence of corroboration of the complainant’s evidence cannot, in my view, in the case of those offences to which s 405C applies now be made the basis of a criticism of his summing-up, but again this does not mean that the judge cannot or should not, as is done in all cases of serious crime, stress upon the jury the necessity for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truthfulness of the witness who stands alone as proof of the Crown case. In all cases of serious crime it is customary for judges to stress that where there is only one witness asserting the commission of the crime, the evidence of that witness must be scrutinised with great care before a conclusion is arrived at that a verdict of guilty should be brought in; but a direction of that kind does not of itself imply that the witness’ evidence is unreliable.  
        
       
       
        
        There will be cases where the failure to bring home to the jury the position of the uncorroborated witness will undoubtedly lead to the verdict being set aside but that is a different matter altogether from requiring a direction that it is unsafe to act on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant in a sex case.” 
        
       
       
      The direction referred to in the last sentence of the first paragraph quoted is sometimes called a “ 
      Murray 
      ” direction.  
       
     22 In Western Australia the common law was changed by a different type of legislation. Section 36BE(1) of the Evidence Act 1906, which was introduced in 1985 (and was replaced in 1988 by s 50) provided: 
      
       
        
        “(1) On the trial of a person for a sexual assault offence or an offence under Chapter XXII of The Criminal Code- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the judge is not required by any rule of law or practice to give in relation to any offence of which the person is liable to be convicted on the charge for the offence a warning to the jury to the effect that it is unsafe to convict the person on the uncorroborated evidence of the person upon whom the offence is alleged to have been committed; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the judge shall not give a warning to the jury of the kind described in paragraph (a) unless satisfied that such a warning is justified in the circumstances.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      Longman v R 
     23 In Longman v R (1989) 168 CLR 79 the High Court majority (Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ) posed the following question at 86: 
      
       
        
        “Does par. (a) dispense with any requirement to warn when the evidence of an alleged victim of a sexual offence is uncorroborated or only with the requirement to warn of the general danger of acting on the uncorroborated evidence of alleged victims of sexual offences as a class?” 
        
       
       
      They held that the latter view was correct (at 87): 
       
       
        
        “If the warning to which par. (a) is directed is a warning that it is generally unsafe to convict for any sexual offence on the uncorroborated evidence of the alleged victim (or, to put the warning another way, that it is unsafe to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of the alleged victim of the particular sexual offence charged because evidence of that kind has been shown by experience to be especially liable to fabrication), par. (a) does not affect the requirement to warn about other perceptible risks of miscarriage of justice. A warning may be required because of the circumstances of the case other than, albeit in conjunction with, the sexual character of the issues which the alleged victim’s evidence is tendered to prove. Paragraph (a) leaves that situation unaffected. 
        
       
       
        
        Furthermore, what par. (a) abolishes is the requirement to give a warning, not a judge’s discretion to comment on the circumstances of the case. No longer may the judge tell the jury that it is dangerous to convict in the circumstances described in par. (a) because the experience of the courts has shown it to be so, but the judge may invite the jury in sexual cases (as is done in other criminal cases) to make their own evaluation of the alleged victim’s evidence in the light of common human experience. By force of par. (a) alleged victims of sexual offences no longer form a class of suspect witnesses, but neither do they form a class of especially trustworthy witnesses. Their evidence is subject to comment on credibility in the same way as the evidence of alleged victims in other criminal cases, but to comment only.” 
        
       
     24 They construed paragraph (b) as follows (at 88-9): 
      
       
        
        “… unlike par. (a), par. (b) must relate, not so much to a warning of the general unsafety of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of alleged victims of sexual offences, as to a warning which a trial judge might consider giving on account of the particular circumstances of the case. That is because par. (b) directs the judge to find his justification for giving ‘such a warning … in the circumstances’. If the warning which may be given pursuant to par. (b) cannot be the warning referred to in par. (a), the phrase in par. (b) ‘a warning … of the kind described in paragraph (a)’ must be taken to mean any warning that it is unsafe in the circumstances of the particular case to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of the particular alleged victim. 
        
       
       
        
        Construing par. (b) in that way, it prohibits in any case of a sexual offence the giving of any warning that it is unsafe to convict the accused on the uncorroborated evidence of the alleged victim unless the judge is satisfied that the particular warning is justified in the circumstances. The judge cannot be so satisfied if there is nothing in the case to require a warning other than the circumstance that proof of the offence rests of the uncorroborated evidence of the alleged victim. So construed, par. (b) first shuts the door on all warnings that it is unsafe to convict an accused on the uncorroborated evidence of an alleged victim, and then reopens it to such warnings where the particular circumstances of the case provide a justification. This construction of the section is somewhat artificial, but it is essential to avoid absurdity. If the words ‘of the kind described in paragraph (a)’ were to be construed so that the warnings referred to by the respective paragraphs were the same, par. (a) would comprehend a warning which might be ‘justified in the circumstances’. Such a construction would accord to par. (a) a wider operation than is accorded to that provision in other States and destroy the protection afforded in appropriate cases by the requirement to give a warning unrelated to the suspicion attaching to the evidence of alleged victims of sexual offences. 
        
       
       
        
        Paragraph (b) thus comprehends more kinds of warnings than the kind of warning to which par. (a) refers. Although a warning can be given only if the judge is satisfied that the warning is justified in the circumstances – and therefore must not be given unless, on a view of the facts reasonably open to the jury, there is an occasion for giving a warning – justification may be found in any requirement of a rule of law or practice which might apply in the circumstances other than the requirement to which par. (a) refers. If, on a view of the facts reasonably open to the jury, a rule of law or practice requires a warning to be given, not being a warning of the kind to which par. (a) refers, the rule must be followed. The rule is itself justification for giving the warning it requires.” 
        
       
     25 The High Court also said (at 86): 
      
       
        
        “the general law requires a warning to be given whenever a warning is necessary to avoid a perceptible risk of miscarriage of justice arising from the circumstances of the case.” 
        
       
       
      For this proposition they cited  
      Bromley v R 
       (1986) 161 CLR 315 at 319 and 323-5 (where some general words to that effect were uttered in a case about a mentally ill witness) and  
      Carr v R 
       (1988) 165 CLR 314 at 330 (where some of the words were repeated in a case about a disputed uncorroborated oral confession).  
       
     26 The High Court then said that the question which arose before the intermediate appellate court and before the High Court was “whether a warning was required that it was unsafe to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant, not by reason of her being an alleged victim of a sexual offence, but by reason of the whole of the circumstances of the case.” They then created what is now known as the “Longman” warning in the following words (at 90-91). For ease of analysis the passage has been broken up.  
      
       
        
        “(A) There were several significant circumstances in the case: the delay in prosecution, the nature of the allegations, the age of the complainant at the time of the events alleged in the two counts in the indictment, the alleged awakening of a sleeping child by indecent acts and the absence of complaint either to the applicant or to the complainant’s mother. It would not have been surprising if these circumstances had elicited some comment from the trial judge, for it would have been proper to remind the jury of considerations relevant to the evaluation of the evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        (B) Of course, any comment must be fairly balanced. For example, any comment on the complainant’s failure to complain should include (as indeed s. 36BD requires) that there may be ‘good reasons why a victim of an offence such as that alleged may hesitate in making or may refrain from making a complaint of that offence’. 
        
       
       
        
        (C) But there is one factor which may not have been apparent to the jury and which therefore required not merely a comment but a warning to be given to them: see R v Spencer 
         [[1987] AC 128 at 141]. 
        
       
       
        
        (D) That factor was the applicant’s loss of those means of testing the complainant’s allegations which would have been open to him had there been no delay in prosecution. Had the allegations been made soon after the alleged event, it would have been possible to explore in detail the alleged circumstances attendant upon its occurrence and perhaps to adduce evidence throwing doubt upon the complainant’s story or confirming the applicant’s denial. After more than twenty years that opportunity was gone and the applicant’s recollection of them could not be adequately tested. The fairness of the trial had necessarily been impaired by the long delay (see Jago v District Court (NSW) [(1989) 168 CLR 23 at 31-32, 42-44, 56-57, 71-72] and it was imperative that a warning be given to the jury. The jury should have been told that, as the evidence of the complainant could not be adequately tested after the passage of more than twenty years, it would be dangerous to convict on that evidence alone unless the jury, scrutinizing the evidence with great care, considering the circumstances relevant to its evaluation and paying heed to the warning, were satisfied of its truth and accuracy. To leave a jury without such a full appreciation of the danger was to risk a miscarriage of justice. The jury were told simply to consider the relative credibility of the complainant and the appellant without either a warning or a mention of the factors relevant to the evaluation of the evidence. That was not sufficient.” 
        
       
     27 In this passage there is movement from the proposition stated in (A), that it “would not have been surprising” if the identified circumstances had elicited a comment, to the assumption in (B) that a comment was “required”. In (C), it is said that not only a “comment” but also a “warning” was required, and the decisive factor calling for a warning was the accused’s loss of those means of testing the complainant’s allegations which would have been available had there been no delay. The movement from a comment which would not have been surprising to a comment which was obligatory, and the movement from an obligatory comment to an obligatory warning, was described thus by Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ in Crampton v R (2000) 75 ALJR 133 at [39]: 
      
       
        
        “The passage distinguishes between two different sets of circumstances: those which might well invite, and, we would interpolate, will generally require, comment; and those in respect of which a warning is imperative.” 
        
       
     28 Longman v R thus does not itself identify clearly when a warning is mandatory, save by reference to the loss by the accused of the means of testing the complainant’s story, which may not have been apparent to the jury. In the authority cited for that proposition, R v Spencer [1987] AC 128 at 141, Lord Ackner (with whom Lords Hailsham of St Marylebone LC, Bridge of Harwich, Brandon of Oakbrook and Mackay of Clashfern agreed) said of accomplices, victims of sexual crimes and children: 
      
       
        
        “In the three established categories where the ‘full warning’ is obligatory, the inherent unreliability of the witness may well not be apparent to the jury. Hence the phrase often used in a summing up – it is the experience of the courts accumulated over many years etc. etc. Complainants of sexual assaults do on occasions give false evidence for a variety of reasons, some of which may not have occurred to a jury. Accomplices may have hidden reasons for lying, and this possibility may again not be apparent to a jury. Children who, although old enough to understand the nature of an oath and thus competent to give sworn evidence, may yet be so young that their comprehension of events and of questions put to them, or their own powers of expression, may be imperfect. All this needs properly to be spelt out to the jury. Hence the well established rule of practice.” 
        
       
       
      Thus even in a case where statute has abolished the rule of practice for sexual crimes, the reasoning underlying it is reintroduced, though to support a different proposition. 
       
     29 Deane J appeared to agree with the majority in saying that the responsibility of trial judges to give appropriate directions included the responsibility to give “an appropriate caution or warning in circumstances where there are potential dangers in acting upon particular evidence which may not, without such a caution or warning, be appreciated by the jury” (at 95-6). But he also said that the court should not fetter the discretion of trial judges by framing in advance particular categories, “such as where there has been a very long delay before the complainant has made any complaint to the authorities, in which a trial judge must be ‘satisfied’ that the relevant warning or caution is ‘justified’” (at 97). He agreed that the appeal should be allowed not because of the absence of speedy complaint or the difficulty of defending a sexual charge, and not because of the long effluxion of time by itself. Rather, he said (at 100-101): 
      
       
        
        “The real force of the applicant’s case lies, however, in the combination of: (i) the circumstances of the alleged offences, and (ii) the possible effect, in the context of those circumstances, of the extraordinary lapse of time before complaint and trial. The gravamen of both offences was the alleged placing or pressing by the applicant of his hand on or against the complainant’s genitalia. There was no suggestion of penetration, or violence or of contact with other than the applicant’s hand. One of the alleged offences occurred when the complainant was six. The other when she was ten. On each occasion, the complainant was asleep immediately before the alleged offence. More than twenty years later, her recollection is that, on each occasion, she awoke to find the alleged offence being committed but pretended to remain asleep. She cannot remember whether she went back to sleep after the incident in the truck. After the other incident, the applicant carried her to her bed where she went back to sleep. It is in the context of the nature of the offences that the length of time between alleged offence and first complaint assumes great significance. The possibility of child fantasy about sexual matters, particularly in relation to occurrences when the child is half-asleep or between periods of sleep, cannot be ignored. The borderline between fantasy and reality can be an uncertain one. Contemporaneous questioning of the child may distinguish fantasy from reality. The long passage of time can harden fantasy or semi-fantasy into the absolute conviction of reality. So to say is not to suggest that the allegations of the complainant in the present case arose from fantasy or semi-fantasy. It is simply to explain why it seems to me that, in the particular circumstances of the case, the complainant’s evidence of the alleged offences which was not given until so long after their alleged occurrence required to be scrutinized with very great care indeed. It was not merely a matter of whether the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant was an honest witness and that the applicant was not. It was a question of the intrinsic reliability of the only evidence which was capable of sustaining a finding of the applicant’s guilt.” 
        
       
     30 It follows that on Deane J’s approach to the question of whether a Longman warning should be given depends very much on the specific circumstances of each case, and not on generalised factors like absence of speedy complaint by a child about sexual behaviour many years earlier. Further, for Deane J, the difficulty created for the accused by delay was not significant: in this respect the bulk of authority is to the contrary. 
     31 McHugh J also agreed that the appeal should be allowed. His reasoning was as follows (at 107-108): 
      
       
        
        In the present case both offences are alleged to have commenced when the complainant was asleep. She testified that on each occasion she pretended to remain asleep. She stated that after the incident in the applicant’s bed she went back to sleep. She could not remember whether she went back to sleep after the incident in the truck. She was about six years old when she alleges that the first offence occurred, and about ten years old when she alleges that the second offence occurred. The complainant did not allege that penetration occurred or was attempted. Both offences were alleged to have occurred more than twenty years before the hearing. 
        
       
       
        
        The fallibility of human recollection and the effect of imagination, emotion, prejudice and suggestion on the capacity to ‘remember’ is well documented. The longer the period between an ‘event’ and its recall, the greater the margin for error. Interference with a person’s ability to ‘remember’ may also arise from talking or reading about or experiencing other events of a similar nature or from the person’s own thinking or recalling. Recollection of events which occurred in childhood is particularly susceptible to error and is also subject to the possibility that it may not even be genuine: Hunter, Memory, rev. ed. (1964), p. 269-270. 
        
       
       
        
        No matter how honest the recollection of the complainant in this case, the long period of delay between her formal complaint and the occurrence of the alleged events raised a significant question as to whether her recollection could be acted upon safely. The likelihood of error was increased by the circumstances in which the complainant said the incidents occurred. The opportunity for error is recalling, twenty years later, two incidents of childhood which are alleged to have occurred as the complainant awoke, and then pretended to be asleep, are obvious. Experience derived from forensic contests, experimental psychology and autobiography demonstrates only too clearly how utterly false the recollections of honest witnesses can be. Certainly, some incident or accumulation of incidents seems to have affected the complainant’s attitude to her stepfather. She testified that, because of his conduct towards her in sexual matters, ‘I don’t hate him but I do hate what he’s done and the problems it’s caused in my life’. However, the existence of this feeling towards the applicant increased, rather than decreased, the need to examine carefully whether the complainant’s honest recollection of events concerning the applicant was not distorted by this hatred.  
        
       
       
        
        To the potential for error inherent in the complainant’s evidence must be added the total lack of opportunity for the defence to explore the surrounding circumstances of each alleged offence. By reason of the delay, the absence of any timely complaint, and the lack of specification as to the dates of the alleged offences, the defence was unable to examine the surrounding circumstances to ascertain whether they contradicted or were inconsistent with the complainant’s testimony.” 
        
       
     32 Since many victims of sexual offences who fail to complain speedily and who give evidence many years later were young children at the time of the relevant events, McHugh J’s stress on errors of recollection, even though linked to events happening to a child waking up but pretending to be asleep, as distinct from Deane J’s stress on the risk of fantasy, would appear to open a wider field for Longman warnings. It must be conceded, however, that later cases have treated McHugh J’s reasoning as being the same as that of Deane J.  
     33 In Crampton v R (2000) 75 ALJR 133 at [42] Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ said that there: 
      
       
        
        “may be some differences, of degree only perhaps, between the joint judgment and those of the other members of the Court: the former would confine the affirmative obligation to give a warning to the matter of delay and the difficulties of testing and disproving allegations by reason of the passage of time, and of the danger of convicting on the complainant’s evidence alone. The reasons of Deane and McHugh JJ might perhaps be read as suggesting that the positive obligation to warn that it might be dangerous to convict on a complainant’s evidence, may arise in a case in which emotion, prejudice or suggestion may operate to distort recollection; or, in which other circumstances of potential danger in acting upon particular evidence exist. For reasons which will appear, in this case we do not think it necessary to explore the significance (if any) of such differences as there may be between the respective reasons for their Honours’ unanimous decision in the result.” 
        
       
     34 This Court must accept the reasoning of the majority, which does appear to call for Longman warnings in a wider range of circumstances than those contemplated by either Deane J or McHugh J. 
      
       
      The effect of the Evidence Act 
     35 The enactment of the Evidence Act 1995 did not affect Longman v R. Section 164(3) abolished whatever was left of the common law requiring a warning relating to victims of sexual crimes and children. Section 165(2) introduced a duty to warn about evidence of a kind which may be unreliable, but only if a party requested this. Section 165(5) provided that s 165 did not affect any other power of trial judges to give a warning to, or to inform, the jury: this preserves Longman v R.  
      
       
      Crofts v R 
     36 Longman v R was referred to in Crofts v R (1996) 186 CLR 427 at 435 and 446, but not in a manner casting significant light on the circumstances in which the warning should be given.  
      
       
      Jones v R 
     37 In Jones v R (1997) 191 CLR 439, a case decided by the majority on the basis that verdicts of guilty on two counts were unsafe and unsatisfactory because of an acquittal on the third, Brennan CJ, in agreeing with that conclusion, said there should have been a Longman warning in relation to the complainant. She gave evidence four years after one of the alleged events. One issue was whether a woman employed as an assistant by the accused, a gymnasium instructor, went home by train or was driven home after that particular incident by the accused. She said the former was possible but she could not recall. Brennan CJ said that the warning should have been given because of “the difficulty of establishing the defence case after a lapse of four years” on the ground that “the lapse of time precluded her ability to be certain about the subject” (at 446). Kirby J agreed that a warning should have been given, but said the warning actually given was adequate (at 464). The majority (Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ) adopted similar reasoning to that of Brennan CJ (at 454-5).  
      
       
      Crampton v R 
     38 In Crampton v R (2000) 75 ALJR 133 the accused was charged with indecency in relation to his former primary school children pupils. Complaint was delayed for twenty years. The majority (Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ) held that a Longman warning should have been given. In fact an attempt to give one took place, but it was held not to have gone far enough. In consequence little explicit attention was devoted to what circumstances will cause a Longman warning to be necessary. But one can infer from the terms of the direction which the majority said should have been given what the relevant circumstance in that case was. It was the inability of the accused, by reason of the delay, adequately to test and meet the complainant’s evidence, to locate other witnesses and to recollect precisely what the accused was doing on the occasion in question: “the denial to an accused of the forensic weapons that reasonable contemporaneity provides, constitute a significant disadvantage”. Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ thought that the bulk of the key passage in Longman v R appearing in the majority judgment should have been put, together with the: 
      
       
        
        “considerations mentioned by Deane and McHugh JJ in Longman: the abstention, by the prosecutor, from questioning each co-complainant about the respective charges, the fragility of youthful recollection, the absence of a timely complaint (subject to any reasonable explanation therefor) and the possibility of distortion” (at [45]).  
        
       
     39 The majority’s statement of the considerations mentioned by Deane and McHugh JJ is in fact much broader than the way those judges put the matter in Longman v R. Since in many cases delay will disadvantage the defence, and since many victims do not complain for a long time and are relying on youthful recollection and their recall may be distorted, the range of cases in which Longman warnings are called for appears to be wide.  
     40 Hayne J held that a Longman warning should have been given because of the inability of the accused adequately to test the complainant’s evidence. 
     41 It was not necessary for Gleeson CJ to deal with the Longman point. Kirby J, who agreed with the majority about the Longman point, went into detail about the need for the warning in that case in a manner which is with respect useful, but treated the detail as merely an example of the general risk of injustice to an accused arising from delay (at [130]-[132]): 
      
       
        
        “The warning required by Longman must be, in the words of the joint reasons in this case, ‘unmistakable and firm’. It must be related to the evidence and derived from forensic experience. The need for such a warning is demonstrated by the facts of a case such as the present. In practical terms, after 20 years, the appellant’s defence could never rise much above a mere denial and protest of innocence. He had lost the chance of obtaining effective evidence from other children who were in the class at the time of the alleged offence concerning his alleged conduct. He had lost the chance of procuring effective evidence from other teachers said to have been coming and going near the class at times relevant to the events alleged. He had lost the chance of resolving, with certainty, the conflict of evidence about the nature and appearance, 20 years earlier, of locations relevant to the charges against him. He had lost the opportunity to collect forensic scientific evidence, such as was available in 1978, concerning the presence (or absence) of semen on the floor of the storeroom. He had lost the opportunity to respond effectively, by the testimony of storekeepers, to evidence that he had purchased lollies and other goods to favour the first complainant. 
        
       
       
        
        Twenty years after the alleged offence, the first complainant was an adult whose life’s experience, character and motivations would have been unknown to the appellant. The appellant would thus be at a great disadvantage in testing events that may have affected the first complainant’s recollection or reliability. Repeated answers to questions, searching the detail of the first complainant’s testimony, such as ‘I can’t remember’ or ‘it’s too long ago’ made it extremely difficult to test that evidence in an effective way. 
        
       
       
        
        The idea that these serious disadvantages are unimportant and that the jury, unaided, will somehow sort things out by simply resolving the claims and denials in oath against oath must be firmly rejected. That idea is contrary to the repeated authority of this Court in and since Longman. The jury need the assistance of the trial judge to warn, from the law’s long experience, that trials with such potentially grave consequences for liberty and reputation need to be fought with forensic weapons. The passage of time – especially great time – may make it difficult, or impossible, to secure such weapons for an adequate defence. A jury may not understand this. A judge will. And the law requires that the judge warn the jury in clear and unmistakable terms.” 
        
       
     42 The suggestion in the concluding paragraph that the Longman warning flows from the “law’s long experience” of the perils it guards against is doubtless correct, but stands in contrast to the relative youth of the warning in our law.  
      
       
      Doggett v R 
     43 In Doggett v R (2001) 75 ALJR 1290 the complainant alleged seven sexual offences against the accused, her stepfather, in the years 1979-1986, during which time she was between 8 and 15 years of age and the accused was between 36 and 43 years of age. Five of the allegations were of indecent dealing and two of attempted rape. The complainant first complained of the alleged incidents shortly after the seventh one, but that complaint was only of “touching”. She said that in 1987 she complained to a school friend, Ms A, of touching and of attempted sexual intercourse; the school friend denied receiving the complaint. In 1990 she made a complaint to her mother of attempted sexual intercourse. In February 1998 she made a statement to the police. In March 1998 she tape recorded a conversation between herself and the accused in the course of which he said things capable of being treated as admissions. 
     44 The complainant’s mother said that after receiving the complainant’s first complaint, she and her son confronted the accused with it, but she could not remember whether he admitted or denied the allegations, and the son did not say that the accused made any admissions. A little later she put the allegations again, and the accused responded in a way which was capable of being treated as an admission. 
     45 The accused’s defence was that the complainant was sexually precocious, that the complainant had engaged in sexual banter with him, and that “there were other times when the two engaged in boisterous physical conduct with sexual undertones”. He said the contents of the tape recorded conversation referred to the sexual banter.  
     46 Gaudron and Callinan JJ set out the contentions of the appellant about why a Longman direction was needed as follows (at [43]-[45]): 
      
       
        
        “First, there is the fact that the complainant was only eight years old when the first and second offences are alleged to have been committed. Whilst it may be accepted that, of course, in adulthood people may have vivid and clear recollections of events which occurred when they were children, the evidence in this case itself demonstrates the truism that accounts of events remote in time need to be carefully scrutinised. The complainant’s evidence was that the first two offences alleged took place at the residence which her mother, her family, and the appellant were occupying in late 1979 or early 1980 during a period when her mother was in Brisbane for medical treatment. In fact, other material before the court fairly conclusively proved that although her mother was treated in Brisbane in February 1980, the appellant did not move into the family residence until June 1980. In his reasons for judgment, Pincus JA suggested an explanation for the discrepancy, that ‘the appellant looked after the complainant and her brothers, on the occasion in question, some time before moving into the complainant’s mother’s house on a permanent basis’. That suggestion will need further examination. With respect to the third count, the appellant pointed out that its timing was related by the complainant to the occasions of the first two counts and was, it was argued by the appellant, therefore subject to the same criticisms as the first two counts. 
        
       
       
        
        The other matters which, the appellant submitted, brought the case within Longman were the young age of the complainant when the offences were alleged to have occurred, the long period that elapsed between the first, subsequent and final ‘complaints’, and the conflict between the complainant and Ms A regarding the making of one of them to her. 
        
       
       
        
        The principal challenge to the reasoning of the Court of Appeal, however, was made in a submission that their Honours (wrongly) regarded the availability of corroboration as extinguishing the need for a Longman direction. Although the submission overstates the position that was adopted by the Court of Appeal, Pincus JA did conclude that the nature of the corroboration provided here, the responses in the telephone conversation, made a Longman direction inappropriate. McPherson JA, who agreed with Pincus JA, said in addition that the responses of the appellant during the conversation disclosed an awareness of the events of which the complainant was speaking and an ability to recollect them adequately.” 
        
       
     47 Gaudron and Callinan JJ held that there was an obligation to give a Longman direction, and that the corroborative evidence did not relieve the trial judge of that obligation, for the following reasons (at [47]-[54]: 
      
       
        
        First, the complainant’s evidence with respect to the circumstances surrounding the first three counts made the point that the complainant’s recollection of some matters was, to say the least, questionable.  
        
       
       
        
        Secondly, the suggested explanation for the complainant’s assertions as to the approximate times of the first two offences is not one, with respect, which strikes us as very likely. It was not suggested as an explanation by the trial judge in his summing up on these counts. If it had been, there and then it would probably have drawn attention to the need for a direction of the very kind for which Longman stands. 
        
       
       
        
        Thirdly, there was evidence from an apparently independent source, Ms A, categorically denying sworn evidence by the complainant that she had told Ms A some years before that she had been sexually touched by the appellant. 
        
       
       
        
        Fourthly, and inevitably, the respondent was obliged to some extent to shift the basis of the prosecution when the discrepancy as to dates with respect to the first two counts, and consequently if less significantly, to the third, emerged. 
        
       
       
        
        Fifthly, the problems with which Longman is intended to deal are not confined to difficulties of recollection that the passage of time might cause for an accused. Of equal, and in some cases of which this might be one, of more importance is the denial by the effluxion of time, to an accused of the forensic weapons that a timely complaint might allow an accused to assemble, such as evidence as to where he was or what he was doing, or what other potential witnesses were doing when the offences were alleged to have occurred. 
         
        This is made clear by the joint judgment (Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ) in Crampton v The Queen: 
         
          
          [They quoted [45], which was summarised and partly quoted in [38] above.] 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Sixthly, as we have already indicated, the corroboration was capable of establishing some undefined sexual molestation, probably improper, but not necessarily criminal in the respects alleged in the counts, and therefore not of such a nature as to relieve the trial judge of a duty to direct the jury in terms of Longman as explained in the passage from Crampton set out above. 
         
        Seventhly, the approach of the Court of Appeal involved to some extent an inversion of reasoning. The correct approach in our opinion was to examine the evidence relevant to the particular matters with which Longman deals to ascertain whether the case called for a Longman direction, and not to make a broad assessment of the evidence overall (including the corroborative evidence), and to decide at that point, that the corroboration rendered a Longman direction unnecessary. That exercise should more appropriately be carried out in the overall assessment of the case, if and after error has been established, to enable the Court to decide whether the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory and whether the proviso should be applied.” 
        
       
     48 Kirby J said that Longman warnings should be given wherever delay caused a serious forensic disadvantage to the accused, and, in the case of long delay, wherever the dangers described by Deane and McHugh JJ in Longman v R existed. He agreed that the need for a warning was not nullified by the existence of corroboration (citing R v Aristidis [1999] 2 Qd R 629 at [11]-[16]). He said the need was not nullified by the fact that the prosecution case was strong or supported by admissions.  
     49 It follows from the majority opinions in Doggett v R that delay coupled with forensic disadvantage is sufficient to create an obligation to give a Longman warning, and it follows from the majority opinions in Crampton v R together with that of Kirby J in Doggett v R, that delay capable of creating the phenomena described by Deane and McHugh JJ in Longman v R is also sufficient.  
     50 Gleeson CJ and McHugh dissented in Doggett v R on the ground that the accused’s counsel had not asked for any warning, and that to have done so would have caused the jury to concentrate on the existence of the corroboration in a manner injurious to the accused’s interests. (There is nothing far-fetched about this suggestion: it was for that very reason that counsel asked for the warning not to be given in R v Arundell [1999] 2 VR 228.) Further, Gleeson CJ said that to warn about the lack of safety in convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant would have been pointless since it was corroborated. McHugh J also said that it was crucial to Longman v R that the jury were being asked to convict on uncorroborated evidence of events twenty or twenty-five years earlier while the complainant, then a young child, was asleep or waking from sleep. The majority statement in Longman v R about the lost forensic opportunities available to the accused had to be read in the light of the general circumstances of the case and in any event were obvious to juries. Crampton v R was in the same category. 
     51 It is obvious that there are sharp divisions within the High Court about Longman warnings. Whatever the merits of the opinions of Gleeson CJ and McHugh J, they are dissenting opinions.  
      
       
      Longman v R in intermediate appellate courts 
     52 In this Court there have been decisions holding that a Longman direction should have been given in relation to the difficulty of the accused defending himself and calling evidence: e.g. R v Kenny (Court of Criminal Appeal, 29 August 1997, unreported: nine years before first complaint; the accused and some of his witnesses were cross-examined to suggest that their evidence was not reliable in view of the time that had elapsed, and one potential witness had become unfit to give evidence); R v Harvey (Court of Criminal Appeal, 9 April 1998, unreported: complaint made over five years after the relevant event, and over five years after the accused, who was convicted of sexual offences against the daughter of his de facto wife, left the family). These cases are discussed in R v Johnston (1998) 45 NSWLR 362 at 371-3. In that case it was held that a Longman warning should have been given because the Crown had attacked the reliability of the recollection of various witnesses five and a half years after the event where the first complaint had not been made until then, and though counsel for the accused had raised the difficulties of defending allegations over five years old, the trial judge had not authoritatively reinforced this point. That case in its actual reasoning turns on the Crown tactics in relying on the reliability of defence witnesses because of the lapse of time, and the following statements of general principle by Spigelman CJ (with whom Sully J and Ireland J agreed) correspond with that reasoning (at 375): 
      
       
        
         “(i) Whenever it appears to a trial judge that delay, whether occasioned by delay in reporting a crime or otherwise, may have affected the fairness of a trial, he or she should make such comments and give such warnings as will ensure that the trial is fair. 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) A comment or warning is required if it appears to the trial judge that a jury may not, from its own experience, fully appreciate the effects of delay on the ability of the accused to defend himself or herself whether by testing prosecution evidence or adducing evidence in his own case, to establish a reasonable doubt about his or her guilt. 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) The need for, and content of, any comment will depend on the circumstances of the case. 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) Whether or not there is a need for any, and if so what, warning will also depend on the circumstances of the case. 
        
       
       
        
        (v) Where it appears from the course of evidence, including cross-examination, or the conduct of the trial, including submissions, that specific difficulties were encountered by the accused in testing the evidence of the prosecution or adducing evidence in defence, then those specific difficulties should be highlighted in the summing-up in such a way as makes it clear that delay, for which the accused had not been responsible, had created those difficulties.” 
        
       
       
      If that were a complete and final statement of the law, the appellant’s argument in this case would face some obstacles. But those statements appear to be narrower than the approaches adopted in  
      Crampton v R 
       and  
      Doggett v R 
       (neither of which referred to  
      R v Johnston 
      ).  
       
     53 The Queensland Court of Appeal took the approach taken by the High Court in Doggett v R: R v Aristidis [1999] 2 Qd R 629 at [11]-[16].  
     54 In South Australia a Longman warning is recognised as appropriate to bring home to the jury “the difficulty which may face an accused person in providing details or background circumstances to events which have occurred some years in the past”: R v K (1997) 68 SASR 405 at 410; R v T (1999) 74 SASR 486 at 491.  
     55 In Victoria it has been held that a Longman warning need only be given where there is no corroboration or the jury may conclude that there is none: R v Arundell [1999] 2 VR 228. That cannot survive Doggett v R. That point apart, R v Arundell treats Longman v R as requiring a warning wherever delay prejudices the accused, though in that case it was held that no unfairness resulted where counsel asked for the warning not to be given.  
      
       
      Should a Longman warning have been given? 
     56 The authorities have been examined in some detail because it is necessary to be certain that statements in the High Court about the conduct or consequences of criminal trials are not misread and treated as being more extreme than they actually are.  
     57 However, it is impossible to escape from the conclusion that if delay causes either forensic prejudice to the accused in the particular circumstances, or risks of the type described by Deane and McHugh JJ in Longman v R, a warning must be given. The passages which support that conclusion cannot be read down or evaded.  
     58 Here there was lengthy delay – twenty years. The complainant was quite young at the time of the event complained of – nine. Though her condition might be seen as confirming her evidence, she did not complain for more than ten years, though she did then complain to her husband and her sister. She did not complain to the police for fifteen years.  
     59 Counsel for the accused said that there was forensic prejudice caused by delay. But for the delay, the accused might have been able to call alibi witnesses or documentary evidence of an alibi.  
     60 The Crown’s first point in answer was that counsel for the appellant did not seek at the trial the direction which it is now said should have been given, and that leave is required under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to advance these grounds. Counsel’s failure is regrettable, but if the appellant’s criticisms are sound, they are, in the light of the High Court authorities, sufficiently important for leave to be given, as it customarily is by this Court in cases concerning Longman directions.  
     61 Secondly, the Crown pointed to the corroboration of the complainant’s evidence by her sister S1. That fact alone does not remedy the deficiency in the directions which is claimed to exist. The delay in complaint which caused the appellant difficulties in dealing with the complainant’s evidence caused equal difficulties in dealing with S1’s evidence. In Doggett v R (2001) 75 ALJR 1290 at [45]-[54] Gaudron and Callinan JJ gave detailed reasons why the existence of corroboration in that case did not relieve the trial judge of the obligation to give a Longman direction, in particular the fifth, sixth and seventh of the reasons quoted above in [47].  
     62 Kirby J, at [131]-[136], held that the existence of corroboration did not necessarily remove the need for a Longman warning. He said at [135]: 
      
       
        
        “where (as here) the corroboration is patchy, in some respects unspecific and in others completely silent on the incidents referred to in the charges, the mere fact that corroborative evidence of some kind exists will not entirely remove the utility, and the necessity, of a Longman warning.” 
        
       
     63 Those three justices formed the majority which allowed the appeal.  
     64 The third point made by the Crown was: 
      
       
        
        “Thirdly, this is a case where the appellant confirmed that he visited his late parents’ home on occasions in the relevant period, although he was mainly living away from that village working for the Railways. His counsel called in the defence case a number of the appellant’s sisters and brothers who lived at the house at the relevant time to give evidence that the appellant’s visits to the home in the relevant period were infrequent and of short duration; some of these witnesses testified that during this period there were no occasions when the appellant was present at the house when there was not also a woman there. It could therefore not be validly claimed that the means of testing the evidence had been lost.” 
        
       
       
      However, if for example the complainant had complained to her parents immediately after the alleged incident, inquiries could have been made at once as to who was in the grandparents’ house, what they heard, where the appellant was, what his version of events was, and whether there was any reason for the complainant being in tears other than the conduct alleged against the appellant. These were advantages almost wholly lost when inquiries could not commence for about fifteen years. 
       
     65 Fourthly, the Crown relied on the reasons for judgment of Gleeson CJ in Doggett v R (2001) 75 ALJR 1290 at [10]. That passage, which denied the need for a Longman warning in every case where there has been a substantial delay in complaining of a sexual offence, follows a passage explaining that during the trial the accused had made no complaint about the difficulties caused by delay. That is not the accused’s position here in the sense that it was the first point which the appellant made to Detective Senior Constable Ogilvy. And in any event Gleeson CJ’s judgment, like that of McHugh J to similar effect, was a dissenting one. 
     66 Fifthly, the Crown submitted that if there was any prejudicial effect in the delay, it would have been obvious to the jury, and indeed the trial judge referred to the impact of the passing of time on the quality of recollection in the passage in the summing up emphasised above. The issue of whether the danger is obvious to the jury divides McHugh J from the majority judges in the High Court cases, and though empirical questions like that are not usually to be answered by the force of authority, the cases are strongly against the submission. 
     67 While obviously the passage of twenty years might will affect memory, there does not appear to be any particular danger of the type to which Deane and McHugh JJ referred in Longman v R. There was, however, some prejudice to the accused’s position by reason of an inability to establish an alibi or some other circumstance which could raise a reasonable doubt as to the correctness of the victim’s complaint. The accused did call some alibi evidence, but his capacity to call more convincing alibi evidence was diminished by the delay. 
     68 It follows that the trial judge should have given a Longman warning.  
      
       
      The content of the Longman warning 
     69 But what should its content have been? And did what he actually say correspond with that content?  
     70 The Crown submitted that the trial judge emphasised the weaknesses in the complainant’s evidence more substantially than the appellant had submitted. That is true. But what the Longman-Crampton-Doggett line of cases requires is not only a warning about the inherent weakness of the complainant’s evidence, but also a warning about the difficulty which delay has caused the accused in trying to deal with the allegations. The trial judge did not mention that beyond what he said in the part of the summing up emphasised above.  
     71 The Crown referred to a passage in R v Johnston (1998) 45 NSWLR 362 at 369, where Spigelman CJ said that the relevant warning did not have to be given in particular terms. Assuming that to be correct, the question remains whether the relevant warning was given here in any terms. 
     72 Crampton v R (2000) 75 ALJR 133 casts light on the present problem. In that case the trial judge said the following about the difficulties caused the defence by late complaint: 
      
       
        
        “Clearly you have to look carefully at the circumstances in which there has been no complaint at the time. But those matters to which I referred are also matters which you must take into consideration and give some thought to. You had the chance to observe both young men in the witness box and to assess their level of sophistication, even now in their early thirties. It is important that you look at the way in which they told you about these matters and the explanation they gave for not having complained earlier, when they were asked about those issues in cross-examination. 
         
         
        Late complaint, of course, necessarily has some potential disadvantages to the accused because it reduces his opportunity to explore the matters complained of in some ways or it has that potential. First of all, of course, memory of events tends to decrease and become vaguer. However, in this case, the accused says it did not happen. Not only did it not happen, there was never an opportunity for it to happen, never an occasion when it would have happened, never an occasion when there could have been a misunderstanding about what was happening. It is quite clear that the accused says there is no occasion of this nature or occasion when it might have been misunderstood. Two things arise, of course, when there is a delay in complaint.  
        One is the opportunity of the accused perhaps to look at matters which were happening at about that time and to raise them in evidence. 
         Also, the capacity of the complainants to be accurate is probably reduced and that may raise some greater difficulty in cross-examination of them. It may also, of course, explain some errors in the recollection.”  
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
     73 The trial judge was then asked to give further directions on the ground that those just quoted fell short of what were called for by Longman v R (1989) 168 CLR 79 at 90-91. She said: 
      
       
        
        “Finally, I just want to make it very clear about this, the matters are to be looked at separately. There is no supporting evidence so that the evidence in one cannot be used in another. The evidence of one complainant cannot be used to support the evidence of the other. There was a very long period in which there was no complaint. The complaint came late. You must take that into account and the circumstances in which it came into existence and what the complainant, that is [the relevant complainant] who was the only one who complained of course, had to say about that. There was no complaint as such from [the other complainant]. He told the police about it when he was approached by the police following the complaint by [the relevant complainant]. You will be aware that in the circumstances of a 20 year delay that clearly those are all matters which you are going to consider. You are going to consider motive, the opportunity to concoct, the reason why that might be. You are going to look very carefully at the nature and circumstances in which that complaint came into existence. Those are all matters that you will bear in mind when you consider the case for the accused.” 
        
       
     74 Of these passages, Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ said, after referring to Longman v R: 
      
       
        
        “As the appellant submits, the first reference by the trial judge to delay was followed by an observation which could have diminished the effect of the caution – it did fall short of a warning – against acting on the evidence of the complainant of a complaint so long delayed. To say what her Honour did in the first passage from her summing up that we have quoted was to say too little, too unemphatically, and less than what Longman required be said in the circumstances of this case. The redirection, which we have also quoted, suffered from some of the same or similar deficiencies. 
         
         
        The trial judge should have instructed the jury that the appellant was, by reason of the very great delay, unable adequately to test and meet the evidence of the complainant. Her Honour should not have offered the qualification that she did in relation to the remarks she did make about the delay. An accused’s defence will frequently be an outright denial of the allegations. That is not a reason for disparaging the relevance and importance of a timely opportunity to test the evidence of a complainant, to locate other witnesses, and to try to recollect precisely what the accused was doing on the occasion in question. In short, the denial to an accused of the forensic weapons that reasonable contemporaneity provides, constitutes a significant disadvantage which a judge must recognise and to which an unmistakable and firm voice must be given by appropriate directions. Almost all of the passage of the majority in Longman to which we have referred (with appropriate adaptations to the circumstances of this case, including that because of the passage of so many years, it would be dangerous to convict on the complainant’s evidence alone without the closest scrutiny of the complainant’s evidence), should have been put to the jury. Additionally, this was, in our opinion, a case in which the trial judge should, again with appropriate adaptation, when summing up, have drawn attention to the additional considerations mentioned by Deane and McHugh JJ in Longman: the abstention, by the prosecutor, from questioning each co-complainant about the respective charges, the fragility of youthful recollection, the absence of a timely complaint (subject to any reasonable explanation therefor) and the possibility of distortion.” 
        
       
     75 Kirby J agreed at [128] that the directions were defective. So did Hayne J at [140]-[143], in stressing the need for there to be not just a comment, but a warning, and a warning about the danger of convicting.  
     76 The trial judge in the present case said nothing specific about the difficulties which delay might have caused to the defence as distinct from the impact of delay on recollection. He said less than the trial judge did in Crampton v R. The upholding of the relevant grounds of appeal in that appeal has the consequence that so far as there was a warning here, it was inadequate.  
     77 In the light of that conclusion, it is not necessary to examine in detail the Crown’s submission that R v Roddom was distinguishable. The point of distinction was said to be that the first of three passages which the Court of Criminal Appeal analysed in that case did not identify “factors such as the delay in the prosecution, the fragility of youthful recollections, the absence of early complaint and the distortion of recollection over time”. The Crown said that the trial judge had given directions of that kind here. However, the real point of R v Roddom was that though the trial judge had given satisfactory directions in the early part of the second passage referred to by the Court of Criminal Appeal in that case, she had undermined the effect by referring to the reasons for delay. While in that case proper directions were undermined, in this case they were scarcely given at all.  
     78 The Crown submitted that even if the warning did not comply with Doggett v R, that case was intended only to apply to the future, not the past. Even if this technique is open to the High Court, there is nothing to suggest that it intended to deploy it in Doggett v R.  
     79 Accordingly Ground 1 succeeds. 
     80 Ground 2, so far as it does not overlap with Ground 1, however, fails. There was nothing wrong with the trial judge’s directions about the complainant’s evidence except that the difficulties which delay in complaint caused to the appellant were not mentioned.  
      
       
      Ground 3(a): direction on intent 
     81 This ground was: 
      
       
       “His Honour erred in law in misdirecting and/or failing to direct the jury as to the following - 
        
       (a) intent …” 
       
     82 The passage in the summing up complained of was: 
      
       
        
        “The next matter is at Canbelego between those dates did assault [the complainant] with intent to commit upon her the crime of rape. Well in the circumstances there of the allegation, what has to be proved is an assault. An assault is a striking, touching or application of force or threat of striking, touching or application of force, without her consent. Well in fact consent does not enter into this matter because it has not been suggested in any way that it occurred. But you would have to be satisfied that it was without her consent, was intentional and that it was without lawful excuse, there’s been no suggestion of lawful excuse. So what is suggested is that she was held down on the bed, that her pants were taken down and that the – he then positioned himself between her legs, after he had put his finger or hand on her vaginal area and that his fly was undone and that she said that she did not quite see his penis but she believed he was trying to have intercourse with her, he was trying to penetrate her.  
         
         
        Because what the Crown have to prove an assault with intent to commit rape. Rape is the penetration of the female vagina by the male penis without consent and knowing that she was not consenting. In this case she says, as I understand it, that what was happening was she was being held down, that as I said her pants were down, his pants were undone and open and down to some extent, he was between her legs, he had previously put his finger into her vagina and she was frightened that he – thought that he was going to try and penetrate her with his penis. 
         
         
        You may think that in the circumstances the only real inference that you could draw from that was that that was what was going to happen. But it is a matter for you, in the circumstances as to whether you are prepared to draw that inference that she was, if she is telling the truth, that was going to happen. The Crown says it is the only reasonable inference. Counsel for the accused says it never happened. It’s not a question of what the inference you draw, he said this in fact never happened. 
         
         
        So they are the ingredients that the Crown has to prove. They have to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, the assault and that there was an intent to commit a crime of rape, as I have outlined. The real issue is was it – did it occur at all. That is the issue, is she – are you satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she is telling the truth about what happened on this particular night. 
         
         
        The Crown case is, very briefly, I don’t propose to go through it in great detail, I can assure you, because it was only tried yesterday and you heard them give evidence about the matter. She said she was down the front of the hotel with her two young sisters. They were called up by the accused to the house, that the two younger sisters were sent down to buy a bottle of Coke. She was taken inside to the bedroom, she has indicated on the exhibit 1. She says he took her pants down and he put her on the bed and put his finger in her vagina and he then, as I say, he had his pants open, she said they were unbuttoned. Her pants were down, he was positioned between her legs and then suddenly he was holding her down, telling her to be quiet but she got up because he told her to be quiet, got off her and she got up because the children were she says outside.” 
        
       
     83 The written submissions of the appellant were as follows. 
     84 First, the appellant said: 
      
       
        
        “His Honour directed on p18 that the intent to rape had to be proved beyond reasonable doubt, but said the real issue was ‘did it occur’ and were they satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she was telling the truth about what happened on this particular ‘night’. The evidence was that the incident happened in the daytime, in the summertime sometime after her grandparents had both died (December 1979) (p19 of transcript).”  
        
       
       
      The trial judge’s mistake about the time was a slip of the utmost triviality. 
       
     85 Next, the appellant said: 
      
       
        
        “His Honour had said the complainant was frightened and apparently she thought that he was going to try and penetrate her with his penis. This is transcribed as ‘that he – thought – on p17 of the SU. His Honour said: 
         
         
          
          ‘You may think that in the circumstances the only real inference that you could draw from that was that that was what was going to happen.’ 
           
          
         
        The complainant was born on 10 May 1969 and was 29 years at the date of trial but could not say how old she was in December 1979 but she was about 9 years at the time of the attack which had taken place after December 1979 when both her grandparents had died. She would have been over 10½ years when the incident occurred on the latter version.” 
        
       
       
      Whether the complainant was mistaken about her age does not affect the merits of the trial judge’s direction. 
       
     86 The appellant then said: 
      
       
        
        “The evidence she gave as to the second count was unsatisfactory and showed uncertainty as to what happened. She did not say that ‘she thought he was going to penetrate her with his penis’. 
         
         
        She gave evidence (pp14) ‘he undone his button and fly, pulled his pants down’, she could not really see his penis. She said he tried to push his penis in but he didn’t … (not transcribable) but could not say what he did, whether he was moving or still, she could not see his penis and could not feel anything (pp 15-16). It was by no means the only inference that the appellant intended to have sexual intercourse without consent.” 
        
       
     87 While it is true that the complainant did not say in terms that she thought the appellant was going to penetrate her with his penis, there is one passage of the evidence to which the appellant’s submission does not refer which is to that substantive effect: 
      
       
        
        “Q, What happened after the accused had pulled his pants down? 
         
         
        A. He tried to get between my legs. 
         
         
        Q. You say he tried to get between your legs? 
         
         
        A. He did. 
         
         
        Q. Can you tell us -- 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: She said he did. 
         
         
        WITNESS: A. Just said he did. 
         
         
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. He did. Now when he did that were you still on the bed? 
         
         
        A. Beg your pardon? 
         
         
        A. When he got between your legs were you still on the bed? 
         
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. And when he got between your legs was he also on the bed? 
         
         
        A. Yes, he was holding down. 
         
         
        Q. And when he got between your legs were your pants still down? 
         
         
        A. Yes.” 
        
       
       
      If the jury accepted that evidence, they could infer that the appellant was intending to have sexual intercourse without consent. That inference was by far the likeliest explanation of the appellant’s conduct.  
       
     88 Ground 3(a) should be rejected. 
      
       
      Ground 3(b): same verdict on each count 
     89 This ground was: 
      
       
       “His Honour erred in law in misdirecting and/or failing to direct the jury as to the following - 
        
       (b) the same verdict to be brought in on each count ….” 
       
     90 The appellant’s written submissions were: 
      
       
        
        “On page 11 of the SU His Honour referred to the defence that the incident did not happen and the Crown case that it did. His Honour then said: ‘There is really, you may think, it is a matter for you, no way you could come to different decisions in relation to each of the counts’. 
         
         
        The first count relied upon the evidence of the complainant as to what happened but the second count as well as relying on what happened as related by the complainant, it was necessary to find the intent of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. On the evidence, the intent was not the only reasonable inference, it, in fact, was speculation or suspicion. His Honour’s remarks were at least misleading and gave strength to draw a wrong conclusion.” 
        
       
     91 The observation of the trial judge which is complained about must be read in the light of the whole passage in which it appears. 
      
       
        
        “As you have been told there are two counts here, they are separate trials and each is a separate, each count is, in effect, a separate trial. Each count has to be separately considered. The fact in relation to each of those and I will give you the evidence in relation to each individual count briefly. That does not mean that you do not look at the overall evidence in relation to each count, in coming to your decision as to the credibility of the witnesses and that overall relationship and background as to what was taking place. You can look at the whole of the evidence in relation to that. But in relation to what the offence was at the time, then you look at the facts and come to a decision on that, bearing in mind the credibility that has been established or not established concerning the witnesses and what is being said. 
         
         
        In this case the defence and it has been raised by the accused and the Crown case is these events happened, the defence is it did not. There is really, you may think, it is a matter for you, no way you would come to different decisions in relation to each of the accounts. If you accept the credibility of the complainant in relation to what she said happened, then I have not understood Counsel for the accused to suggest to you that the offences would not have been committed. What he says and says very forcibly is it never took place, but you still have to be satisfied in relation to those ingredients and I will come back to them shortly and explain them to you.” 
        
       
     92 It was theoretically open to believe the appellant on one count but not the other. The passage complained of contradicts that possibility. But it is unlikely to have misled the jury in view of the passages preceding and following it, which state the correct theoretical position. However, that position is only a theoretical one. If the jury disbelieved the complainant on digital penetration, it would have been highly unlikely to have believed her on assault with intent to rape, and vice versa. No request for a redirection was made at the trial. The triviality of the present complaint is such that leave should be refused in relation to it. 
      
       
      Ground 3(c): lies 
     93 This ground was: 
      
       
       “His Honour erred in law in misdirecting and/or failing to direct the jury as to the following - 
        
       (c) lies by accused and/or defence witnesses.” 
       
     94 The appellant’s submissions were as follows: 
      
       
        
        “His Honour directed as to lies by the accused and his witnesses on p15 of the Summing Up. His Honour pointed out the onus and that it would still be a matter the Crown ‘have to prove it’ the ‘it’ apparently meaning the ‘onus of proving the case against the accused’. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        It is not clear, but it appears that when His Honour said that the lies of the accused and/or his witnesses would make it ‘easier’ for them to accept the complaint that this went to a consciousness of guilt and not to the credibility of the witnesses. The onus of proving the evidence of a witness rather than that of the accused to be lies rested on the Crown and if a witness is proved to have lied, it is usual to direct that the credit of that witness is affected rather than affecting the credit of another (opposing) witness. 
         
         
        The direction clearly did not comply with Edwards v The 
          
        Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193 and was contrary to Zoneff (2000) 74 ALJR 895 where the direction was given warning of following a process of reasoning that just because a person is lying about something, that is evidence of guilt. This would especially be so when it is a witness for the defence that is shown to be lying. 
         
         
        The evidence moreover of the witness does not sustain that the witnesses for the defence were lying (see ground 4). 
         
         
        The direction given did not avoid the risk of the jury embarking on an impermissible line of reason but tended to invite such a line of reasoning (see also R v G J H (2001) CCA 128 (24 April 2001) para 58-66).” 
        
       
     95 The whole of the trial judge’s summing up on lies was as follows: 
      
       
        
        “Now the Crown have suggested to you that the accused and his witnesses have been telling lies concerning what the situation was concerning his opportunity that he may have had to be alone with the complainant and you will understand his case is, as I understand it, it did not take place and there was never any opportunity for me to be alone with the girl and as I understand all the witnesses that were called, were called to prove that was the situation, that there was, they say, never an opportunity when he would have been alone with the girl. The Crown suggests to you that they are not telling the truth. Well that is a matter for you to decide, people of course can tell lies for a number of reasons one I suppose that would immediately spring to mind is fear of being wrongly convicted, might be one. The Crown still bears the onus of proving the case against the accused and even if you came to the conclusion that the witnesses and the accused were telling lies concerning this situation, then it would still be a matter the Crown have to prove it. It is not a matter of saying they are telling lies, therefore he is guilty. You have still got to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown’s witnesses are telling the truth. 
         
         
        However, if you are satisfied that the accused and/or his witnesses were telling lies, one effect it may have on you is that it would – may make it easier for you to accept the evidence of the complainant as to what she says occurred between them. Whether it does have that effect or not is entirely a matter for you.” 
        
       
     96 The Crown submitted: 
      
       
        
        “As to lies, para 24 of the appellant’s submissions appear to misconstrue his Honour’s directions, which it is submitted were dealing with ‘credibility lies’, rather than ‘consciousness of guilt lies’. His Honour’s directions at SU 15.4 et seq complied with the direction suggested in para 23 of Zoneff v The Queen (2000) 200 CLR 234, which deals with ‘credibility lies’. The alleged lies were not left to the jury as ‘consciousness of guilt lies’ and his Honour was not required to direct the jury in accordance with Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193.  
         
         
        The direction did not invite the jury to embark on an impermissible line of reasoning. What his Honour said at SU 15.8 was logical and permissible.” 
        
       
       
      The Crown’s submission is correct, and the appellant’s submission is entirely groundless. Ground 3(c) is rejected.  
       
     97 Related to this topic is another argument not the subject of a ground of appeal and only briefly put. The argument was that the Crown prosecutor never put to the witnesses that they were biased or were lying. A perusal of the relevant transcript reveals that the witnesses cannot have been in doubt about what the cross-examiner was suggesting.  
      
       
      Ground 4: unreasonable verdicts 
     98 This ground was: 
      
       
       “The verdicts of the jury were unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence and were unsafe and unsatisfactory giving rise to a miscarriage of justice.” 
       
     99 The written submissions of the appellant in support of this ground consisted largely of a summary – it cannot be called an analysis – of the evidence of the complainant, her mother, her sister S1, the appellant, the appellant’s brother and three of the appellant’s sisters on the questions of the chronology of occupancy of the grandparents’ house. 
     100 The appellant’s submissions commenced by saying it was not clear when the offence occurred – while the complaint was nine, between 10 May 1978 and 10 May 1979, which was a period not covered by the indictment – or after her grandparents died in December 1979.  
     101 It is convenient to deal at this point with a submission to which no ground of appeal relates. It was: 
      
       
       “The jury should have been given a direction that if they found that the complainant relied upon the latter period, then it was open to them to acquit if they were of the opinion, bearing in mind there was no onus on the appellant, … that it was reasonably possible during this period that the appellant was not alone at the grandparents’ house … .” 
       
      There is nothing to suggest that any such direction was asked for by the appellant’s counsel at the trial. If not, leave is needed to advance the argument, and that leave should be refused. In any event, the point is hopeless: virtually all the defence evidence was directed to an endeavour to establish the proposition that the appellant could never have had an opportunity to commit the offences because some other adult would always have been in the grandparents’ house. Hence no direction was necessary. 
       
     102 Despite the timing doubt raised by the appellant’s submissions, the evidence is all one way that the alleged offences took place after the grandparents’ death, and that the complainant’s uncertainty about her age related to an inessential detail only. 
     103 The appellant’s submissions appear to accept that, because they proceeded as follows: 
      
       
        
        “The occupation of the grandparents’ house appears to be after December 1979 as follows: 
         
         
        (1) [G, C1 and C2] until early May 1980. 
         
         
        (2) [G and C1] and possibly [BH] and family until December 1980. [BJ] also lived there part of the time.  
         
         
        The appellant visited his parents’ house after December 1979 on occasions mostly for 2 nights of a week-end until December 1980 (the end of the period in the indictment) but not on the evidence at any time when there was not a female in the home. 
         
         
        [CS] was mostly in the home from December 1979 to April 30, 1980 whilst she was pregnant, her second child being born on 30 April 1980. Up to that time [G and C1] were in the home. 
         
         
        After that [BH] and her family were in the parents’ house until December 1980 (confirmed by [G]). 
         
         
        [G and C1] were living in the house until at least October 1980 and on [C1’s] evidence until about May 1981. 
         
         
        On the Crown case the complainant and her family moved into the house in December 1980. 
         
         
        There was no evidence to support the fact that no one else was living in the house except the appellant at any time during the period of the indictment. The Crown case relied substantially on the fact that no one else than the appellant was either living there or at home. 
         
         
        The summer in 1979-80 after December [CS] was mostly in the home pregnant, [C1 and G]. The summer in 1980-1 to December, [G] possibly [C] and possibly [BH] and her family were living there. If the incident occurred allegedly after December 1979, the above evidence creates a reasonable doubt that the jury should have entertained and the verdicts for that reason cannot be supported.” 
        
       
     104 This argument rests on a fundamental fallacy. So far as it asks this Court to conclude that, or experience a reasonable doubt about whether, during every minute of daylight from December 1979 until the end of 1980 the grandparents’ house was occupied by an adult other than the appellant, it is asking the court to reach an impossible conclusion in the absence of evidence, for example, that there was a bedridden invalid there at all times. There was no such evidence. The evidence which the appellant’s siblings gave about an adult always being in the house during the relevant period does not support the necessary conclusion. Only BHsaid that she never left the house. No other witness said that. To the extent that a particular witness had left the house, the evidence of that witness that someone else was there ceased to have probative value, because the fact asserted ceased to be within the witness’s personal knowledge from shortly after the moment of departure. The contention advanced by BH that she was “always there” (page 43 line 59) totally lacked credibility. It was contradicted, for example, by her own evidence in chief that she left the house to go shopping with her husband once a fortnight for half a day in Cobar (page 34 lines 14-25).  
     105 The Crown demonstrated numerous inconsistencies amongst the defence witnesses as to who was living in the house at different times and how often the appellant visited it. In themselves these inconsistencies were not decisive of anything, but they do cast a cloud over the reliability of the defence evidence so far as it essayed the almost impossible task of negating any opportunity for the appellant to commit the crimes or raising a reasonable doubt on that issue. The reliability of that evidence is further undermined when it is read as a whole: while it was open to the jury to accept it, its strongly partisan tone makes it easy to understand why they appear to have rejected it.  
     106 The Crown case was neither particularly weak nor particularly strong. It alleged events that had happened a long time ago to a young child, in respect of which there was only weak corroboration, and in respect of which there had been long delays in complaint. On the other hand, there was nothing inherently implausible or self-contradictory in the complainant’s allegations. The jury were entitled to treat the delays in complaint, and the manner in which the complaints were eventually made, as not adverse to the complainant’s credibility.  
     107 In oral address the appellant contended that the complainant had given mistaken evidence about who was living at the grandparents’ house. The submission rests on a misreading of the evidence.  
     108 The relevant tests for determining whether the verdict resulted in a miscarriage of justice within the meaning of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 were set out in M v R (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493-5: 
      
       
        
        “Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which is was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonably jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.” 
        
       
       
      It cannot be said that the evidence admitted at the trial contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead this Court to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted.  
       
     109 Ground 4 should be rejected. 
      
       
      Proviso in relation to Ground 1 
     110 The Crown contended that the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 should be applied, that is, that the appeal should be dismissed on the ground that “no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred”.  
     111 The application of the proviso depends on the error not being one which is so fundamental as to have caused the trial to miscarry so far as hardly to be a trial at all, and on the conviction being “inevitable”, so that the appellant can be said not to have lost a chance which was fairly open to him to have been acquitted. See Glennon v R (1994) 119 ALR 706 at 710-712. This error is not fundamental in the sense just described. Attention must therefore be directed to the strength of the Crown case. The Crown submitted that it was high. The victim’s story was inherently credible and coherent. Her failure to complain until she complained to her husband was understandable. The fact that she complained to him when she did was understandable. There was some evidence confirming the complainant’s evidence, though not strongly. Though the defence called witnesses, their performance may have strengthened the Crown case partly because they were seen to be trying too hard and partly because they contradicted each other.  
     112 The appellant’s submission that the Crown case was weak is baseless. But once it is assumed, as it must be, that the prejudicial effect of delay on the forensic position of the appellant was not obvious to the jury, unless it had been explained to them, the warning which was not given could have caused them to experience a reasonable doubt. 
     113 Hence the proviso cannot be applied.  
      
       
      Ground 5: sentence 
     114 This ground was: 
      
       
       “The sentences were excessive in that - 
        
       (a) His Honour did not take into account the previous record of the applicant. 
        
       (b) Did not apply the principle of totality correctly.” 
       
     115 It is not necessary to decide this ground in view of the appellant’s success on Ground 1, but the arguments advanced should be considered. On 25 September 2001 the appellant filed the following written submission: 
      
       
        
        “His Honour on the proceedings on sentence on 23/2/2001 (p2) was told by the Crown Prosecutor that the penalty for the ‘rape charge’ was twenty years and in respect of the indecent assault, his Honour concluded it was 4 years but under 16 years 6 years. 
         
         
        The latter offence was not charged in respect of a female under 16 years and the penalty accordingly was 4 years. If the charge had averred “a female under 16 years’ and given her age, the penalty would be 6 years (see Section 76 copy attached). 
         
         
        The charge under Section 65 (copy attached) carried a penalty of 14 years penal servitude at the time NOT 20 years. His Honour accordingly sentenced the applicant on the wrong basis.” 
        
       
     116 Let it be assumed that the sentencing judge had in mind incorrect maxima on each charge. The question remains whether the sentences actually given conform with principle. The submissions of the appellant on whether they conform with principle were: 
      
       
        
        “At the time these offences were committed the applicant was 20 years of age and had no convictions. The applicant at the time of trial on 7/12/98 was 39 years and at the time of sentence on 23 February 2001, 41 years. 
         
         
        The applicant for the other matters was sentenced on a totality basis in respect of the charges in the 4 trials and the sentence of 8 years was imposed on the offence of having sexual intercourse with BLY she being under 16 years c.c. 8 years when the applicant forced her to suck his penis. The application of the principles of totality if the applicant had been dealt with at the same time as the other matters would have justified concurrent sentences for these offences. The head sentences of 8 years + 5 years a total of 13 years on a totality basis appears excessive when there it is not certain that the applicant will be released in 2006 at the end of his non parole period.” 
        
       
     117 The fact that the appellant had no convictions at the time the offences were committed does not alter the fact that the offences were serious. They were committed on a young child in circumstances where the appellant had considerable power over her. They were capable of causing her harm in later life, and the evidence of the complainant’s ex-husband appears to indicate that to some degree they have caused her harm. There is nothing in the duration of the sentences in themselves to suggest that they are outside a range fairly open to the sentencing judge. 
     118 It seems that the sentences now being served by the appellant related to his conduct in relation to a child who in relation to two convictions was eight years old and in relation to a further conviction was about fifteen. The first conviction related to forced fellatio, the second to indecent assault, and the last to indecent assault and attempted rape. In relation to the first conviction the appellant was sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment. Lesser sentences were given in relation to the other convictions, and they were ordered to be served concurrently with the eight year sentence. The submission of the appellant that the two sentences under consideration in the current appeal would have been made concurrent with the eight year sentence had all matters been dealt with at the same time is rejected. The victims were different. The times when the crimes were committed were different. The places where they were committed were different. The criminality appears entirely distinct. Even taking into account the principle of totality, the total sentences are not excessive in the light of the nature of the appellant’s various crimes. Hence, were it necessary to consider the merits of Ground 5, it should be rejected. 
      
       
      New trial? 
     119 The result is that the appellant succeeds in relation to Ground 1 but fails on the other grounds. Normally success in relation to a ground like Ground 1 would result in an order for a new trial. Should that order be made in this case, or should the appellant be acquitted? 
     120 This is a very old case. There was a lengthy delay between the time of the alleged commission of the offences and the time of the first trial. There has in turn been considerable delay between the time of the trial in 1998 and now. There would be further delay if the appellant was required to stand trial again. While the first trial was short and a second trial is likely to be equally short, a second trial will be “an ordeal for the defendant which the defendant ought not to be condemned to undergo for a second time through no fault of his own unless the interests of justice require that he should do so.”: Reid v R [1980] AC 343 at 350 per Lord Diplock. The Crown case is not weak, but it is not so strong that a properly directed jury would inevitably convict or would even be very likely to convict. On the other hand, the appellant has been fortunate in being able to take advantage of a technical error by the trial judge, into which he was led by the failure of his own counsel to seek the correct direction, perhaps for tactical reasons. The offences charged are serious, and their prevalence appears to be widespread. The trial was not prolonged or complex. The appellant has not served any part of the sentence because of the other sentences he is serving. He will not be released for some years. The admissible evidence given at the trial was sufficiently cogent to justify a conviction, and the circumstances do not raise any question of whether the order for a new trial will give the prosecution an opportunity to supplement what was at the first trial a factually defective case: the case was not factually defective. In all the circumstances the court’s discretion under s 8 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 should be exercised in favour of ordering a new trial.

      Judgment 
     1 PRIESTLEY JA: I agree with Powell JA.2 POWELL JA: This is an Appeal and a Cross-Appeal from a judgment delivered by Sidis DCJ, and a judgment entered and orders made by her Honour pursuant thereto on 30 May 2000.3 In the proceedings with which her Honour was concerned to deal, the Respondents, who were the Plaintiffs before her Honour, sought, inter alia, to recover from the Appellants damages, the claims for which were based variously in tort – for alleged misrepresentations – pursuant to the provisions of s 42 of the Fair Trading Act 1987, in respect of conduct said to have been misleading or deceptive, and in contract for what were said to have been breaches of certain warranties entered into by one or other of the parties to the proceedings. In order that one might more readily understand how these various claims arose, I record that they related, ultimately, to three separate transactions they being: 
      
       
       (1) the purchase by the Third Respondent, Ecrovest Pty Limited (“Ecrovest”), a company apparently controlled by the First Respondent, Karol Klich (“Mr Klich”) from the Second Respondent, Fernando Quiambo (“Mr Quiambo”) of two businesses said to have been conducted by Mr Quiambo in the Sydney Metropolitan area, those businesses being known as “AAA Abest Cleaning”, or “AAA Abala Cleaning”, and “AAA Aba Pest Control” - the former being a carpet cleaning business and the latter being a pest control business – under an agreement for sale dated 31 October 1997, for the sum of $210,000 of which $150,000 was provided by Mr Klich, and the balance of $60,000 was by way of vendor finance; 
       
      
      
       
       (2) the purchase by the Fifth Respondent, Abala Pty Limited (“Abala”) from the First Appellant, Paul Kent Scarborough (“Mr Scarborough”), pursuant to an agreement for sale dated 15 February 1998, of a carpet cleaning business known as “AAA Abaca Cleaning”, conducted by Mr Scarborough in Melbourne, for the sum of $80,000, of which $30,000 was provided by Mr Klich, and the Second Respondent, Richard Adams-Dzierba, (“Dr Adams”), the balance of $50,000 being by way of vendor finance; 
       
      
      
       
       (3) the purchase by the Fourth Respondent, Abaca Pty Limited (“Abaca”), from the Third Appellant, Victoria Esperanza Quiambo (“Ms Quiambo”), Mr Scarborough’s wife and Mr Quiambo’s sister, pursuant to an agreement for sale dated 15 February 1998, of a business known as “AA Abala Cleaning”, conducted by Ms Quiambo in Brisbane, for the sum of $140,000, of which $90,000 was advanced by Mr Klich and Dr Adams, the balance of $50,000 being by way of vendor finance. 
       
     4 The misrepresentations of which the Respondents complained were said to have been made by Mr Scarborough – who, in addition to having been the vendor of the Melbourne business, was said to have managed the Sydney businesses on behalf of Mr Quiambo – and by the Fourth Appellant, Thea Fardouly (“Ms Fardouly”), a licensed Real Estate Agent, who claimed (Black AB 507) also to have been a Consultant with Sidney Raper Property Consultants, which was a licensed Business Broker. The representations made by Mr Scarborough were said to have been false to his knowledge, and therefore fraudulent.5 The warranties, in respect of which damages and breach were claimed concerned, in the case of all businesses, the fee basis of those businesses and, in addition, in respect of the Sydney businesses, concerned the average income of the businesses in the three months preceding the date of sale.6 In addition to defending the proceedings, each of Mr Scarborough, Mr Quiambo and Ms Quiambo brought a Cross-Claim seeking to recover the amounts which were outstanding under their respective Agreements for Sale.7 Prior to June 1997, Ecrovest operated a contract cleaning, and property maintenance business, that business being managed by Mr Klich and, so he said, being successful. 8 In early 1997, Mr Klich and his wife, who had recently made a capital profit out of a property development, decided to invest that profit, which was of the order of $210,000, in a business. What Mr Klich had in mind was a business that would generate a good income, but which had a manager, as he (Mr Klich) did not think that he would have the time to manage a second business.9 In June 1997 Mr Klich saw in the “Businesses for Sale” section of the “Sydney Morning Herald” an advertisement for a domestic carpet cleaning business, which advertisement stated that the business was under management, and which gave the name of Ms Fardouly as a contact.10 Mr Klich telephoned Ms Fardouly and arranged to meet her. When he did so, so he said, she, in response to his request to have her tell him about the business, replied (Blue AB 2): 
      
       
        
         
         “This is a great businesses. This is a cash business. The owner will not need have anything to do with the business. It is run by management. The manager is very good. I have a summary of the details of the business here for you”. 
         
        
       
     11 In the “Summary of the Details of the Business” which were then handed to Mr Klich was a document of 7 pages (Blue AB 151-157), containing a number of representations as to the business. Among those representations were the following: 
      
       
        
         
         “Established: 2 YEARS

         BRIEF HISTORY: The business started over two years ago with just two subcontractors and has rapidly grown. A recent addition now brings the total of subcontractors up to 6. The owner of the business has no imput (sic) other than policy and direction and business is run by the manager with a part time assistant. Initially work came only from advertising but a strong repeat and word of mouth trade is now ongoing. This will gradually provide future growth.

         Current advertising budget is $1,950 per week. This is spread over the Yellow Pages, and three newspaper groups, Cumberland, Fairfax and ESN. The latter covers 27 newspapers. Future entries for the Yellow Pages are  
         booked and paid 
          for and arrangements are underway for inclusion in the new publication called The Big Colour Pages. Also pamphlet distribution over the entire Sydney Metropolitan area is ongoing and current stock in advance is approximately $1,000,000.

         The business is completely equipped including spare machinery to cover breakdowns and there is the usual office equipment including a computer system that tracks daily operations and posts all statistics and records. The sale price includes all plant and equipment.  
         
        
       
      
      
       
       Also given were ‘Details of Operational Expenditure’ of $2,600 per week and a ‘Weekly Summary’ showing a turnover of $13,000 less commissions, $3,900 less expenses of $2,700 and less wages $390, leaving a net profit of $6,010”. 
       
     12 After he had read through the document, so he said, Mr Klich asked Ms Fardouly the price which the vendor sought, to which she replied (Blue AB 3): 
      
       
        
         
         “The price is $210,000. The business is run under management. I will arrange a meeting for you with the Manager, Kent Scarborough. As you can see in the ‘Details of Business’ the Manager is getting 30% of the weekly net profit. This works out at about $2,000”, 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       to which he replied: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         “Well that’s fine with me. If that means he is getting $2,000 that means I would be getting $4,000”. 
         
        
       
     13 A little later, there was a meeting between Mr Klich, Mr Scarborough and Ms Fardouly at a restaurant in Kensington. At that meeting, Mr Scarborough described in general terms how the business was conducted. In the course of the conversation Mr Scarborough said that he received 30% net profit of the business, and a little later that he wanted to stay with the business. He then indicated that, if Mr Klich wished, he could come to the office, which was at his home at Bondi, to “look at the set-up”.14 On the following day, Mr Klich visited Mr Scarborough’s home, where the latter showed him the office which was in a garage that had been set up as an office. While he was there, Mr Scarborough explained to Mr Klich how the paperwork was handled, and how the data was entered into the office computer. Towards the end of the meeting, according to Mr Klich, Mr Scarborough handed to him a bundle of print outs showing gross takings, expenses and bookings for the previous three months – those documents can no longer be found. It was Mr Klich’s recollection that the documents recorded the gross takings of the business at about $14,000 per week, they being similar figures to those recorded in computer files which had been opened by Mr Scarborough for the purpose of showing Mr Klich the records which were kept on the business during the course of discussions on that day. According to Mr Klich, Mr Scarborough said (Blue AB 6): 
      
       
        
         
         “This is a great business. I set it up, it’s my creation, however the owner invested the money needed to set it up. It’s no use looking at our bank accounts to check the takings because it is a cash business and very little money goes through the bank account. All the cash is taken out by the owner. A lot of expenses are paid in cash too”. 
         
        
       
     15 According to Mr Klich, there was a further meeting between himself, Mr Scarborough and Ms Fardouly in early September 1997, in the course of which reference was made to a pest control business. At the time, so Mr Klich said, Mr Scarborough said (Blue AB 6): 
      
       
        
         
         “This is another business that I run from the same premises. This business is for sale as well. This business is run on the same basis as the carpet cleaning. I am paid 30% of the net profit. The usual takings are about $5,000 per week. The profit is about $2,500 and I get a third of that. The owner wants $140,000 for the pest control business. You can have both businesses for $360,000”. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
        
       
     16 Discussions as to the purchase of the Sydney businesses by Mr Klich, or by Mr Klich and a former partner, continued for some time. It appears to be common ground that, at one meeting, at which Mr Klich and his former partner were present, Mr Scarborough said that the turnover of the carpet business was about $13,000 per week, and that of the pest control business about $5,000 per week. It seems also to have been common ground that, during the course of these meetings, Mr Scarborough agreed that, if Mr Klich were to buy the businesses, he (Mr Scarborough) would stay on as Manager on the same terms, namely that he was paid 30% of the net takings. Mr Scarborough also claimed to have told Mr Klich that he would continue as Manager only if there was no interference with, or changes made to, his method of management.17 Mr Klich said that in a conversation which he had with Mr Scarborough during September 1997 the latter said (Blue AB 8): 
      
       
        
         
         “The owner of the Sydney business also has similar businesses in Melbourne and Brisbane which are also run out of this office. They are also for sale. You should think about purchasing these businesses as well. They are very profitable”. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
        
       
     18 When he expressed some interest, so Mr Klich said, Mr Scarborough showed him spreadsheets of each of those businesses on the computer screen.19 On 1 October 1997, Mr Klich received from Ms Fardouly, by facsimile, details of the pest control business and what were said to be copies of spreadsheets relating to the Trading Performance of that business (Blue AB 158-172). The “Weekly Summary of accounts” was said to include a Turnover of $5,500, less Commission of $2,430, less Advertising of $1,220, (Yellow Pages $280, Coupons $420, and Newspaper Advertising $520), leaving a Profit of $1,850.20 It was at about this time when there was a further meeting between Mr Klich, Mr Scarborough and Ms Fardouly, during the course of which Mr Klich offered $210,000 for both businesses, on the basis of $150,000 in cash, the balance to be provided by way of vendor finance for one year interest free. In a later telephone conversation, Ms Fardouly indicated that “the owner” would accept that offer.21 On a number of occasions in the following weeks, Mr Klich went to Mr Scarborough’s home to speak to him, and also to check on the takings of the businesses while an Agreement for Sale was prepared. On those occasions, Mr Scarborough showed him printouts as to Takings, Bankings and Expenses, the figures relating to the carpet cleaning business regularly showing Gross Takings of between $13,000 and $14,000 a week.22 On 17 October 1997, Mr Klich received from Ms Fardouly by facsimile, further information as to the pest control business (Blue AB 173), which information included a statement that the Turnover of the business per week was $5,000.23 It was at about this time when there were several meetings between Mr Klich and Ms Fardouly in relation to the Brisbane and Melbourne businesses, at the first of which meetings Ms Fardouly gave Mr Klich documents entitled “Details of Business – Melbourne” (Blue AB 174-179) and “Details of Business – Brisbane” (Blue AB 180-185). 24 The former document contained the following (inter alia) information as to the Melbourne business:

     26 The Agreement for Sale (Blue AB 186-196) of the Sydney businesses by Mr Quiambo to Ecrovest was signed and completed on 31 October 1997. For present purposes the following Special Conditions should be noted: 
      
       
        
         
         “3. The Purchaser acknowledges that in entering into this agreement he has not relied on any statement, representation, warranty or condition other than as specifically contained herein, made or given by the Vendor or by any person or agent on the Vendor’s behalf. In particular the Purchaser relies on his own enquiries in relation to the fee base of the businesses which the Vendor warrants as being correct as at the date of this Deed (sic). The Vendor does not warrant or guarantee that the fees receivable from the clients will continue after the date of this agreement on historical levels or otherwise and the Purchaser shall purchase the clients’ goodwill without any such warranty or guarantee by the Vendor.

         The vendor agrees to advance to the Purchaser Vendor’s finance in the sum of Sixty thousand dollars ($60,000) such sum to be repaid by the Purchaser to the Vendor at the rate of Ten thousand dollars ($10,000) per month with the first payment payable one month from the date of completion of this Agreement. It is further agreed that if any monthly payment is in arrears for more than 7 days then the whole of the balance then outstanding will immediately become due and payable to the Vendor together with interest at the rate of 10% per annum. It is further agreed that the Vendor may take whatever action as is deemed necessary for the recovery of such sum as a liquidated debt due to the Vendor. The Purchaser agrees that if requested by the vendor the Purchaser will enter into a Trader’s Bill of Sale over the plant and equipment of the businesses to secure any such sum that may be owing to the Vendor”. 
         
        
       
     27 Despite the terms of Special Conditions (3) and (4) (a), (b), it was Mr Klich’s case that, in deciding to have Ecrovest proceed with the purchase of the Sydney businesses, he relied on the “Details of Business” document which had been given to him by Ms Fardouly in June 1997, the financial figures for the businesses provided to him by Mr Scarborough and Ms Fardouly thereafter, and the representations as to the performance of the businesses which were made from time to time by Mr Scarborough and Ms Fardouly.28 In an Affidavit sworn by him on 7 December 1998, Mr Klich deposed (inter alia) as follows, (Blue AB 13-14): 
      
       
        
         
         “22. … 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         Following the purchase of the Sydney business in October 1997 (and apart from the usually quiet weeks of Christmas and New Year) the figures shown to me by Scarborough each week were very close to the figures promised to me. Scarborough continued to manage the business for me. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         During November and December 1997 I collected from Scarborough the cash ‘profit’ of the business each week. All of this money was put back into the business. At the end of each of those months I gave Scarborough $10,000 to pay to the vendor. We had a conversation to the following effect: 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
          
           
           KS: ‘Fernando has asked me to collect the payments due under the vendor finance arrangement for him’. 
           
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         In mid November 1997 we purchased a vehicle for the Sydney pest control business. Another vehicle was purchased for the carpet cleaning business in January 1998. I understood the Sydney businesses to be generating profit in line with the representations in the detail of business … and the representations referred to above, but that this profit was being used to make monthly payments under the vendor finance arrangement and for the purchase of the new vehicles”. 
         
        
       
     29 Meantime, so it would seem, both Mr Scarborough and Ms Fardouly continued to encourage Mr Klich to buy the Brisbane and Melbourne businesses. By early, to mid, December the position had been reached where Mr Klich expressed an interest in buying the businesses and the question of price was discussed. However, the price suggested by Ms Fardouly was such that, if Mr Klich were to proceed, he would need another to join him in any purchase. Accordingly, he approached Dr Adams to ascertain whether he was interested in joining with Mr Klich and, when Dr Adams indicated that he was interested, Mr Klich paid a holding deposit of $12,000 for the two businesses.30 In early January 1998, there was a meeting between Mr Klich, Dr Adams and Mr Scarborough at Mr Scarborough’s home, at which meeting, after Mr Scarborough had shown Dr Adams the layout, Mr Scarborough called up what was said to be spreadsheet files relating to the Melbourne and Brisbane businesses, and pointed to what were said to have been the takings for weeks in the preceding months – those takings were said by Mr Scarborough to have been, in relation to the Brisbane business, never less than about $7,000 per week, and, in relation to the Melbourne business, about $5,000 per week. At Dr Adams’ request, Mr Scarborough later produced what was said to be a bundle of printouts for each of both the Brisbane business (Blue AB 216-221) and the Melbourne business (Blue AB 198-215).31 Eventually, Mr Klich negotiated with Ms Fardouly $140,000 for the Brisbane business and $80,000 for the Melbourne business, the vendor of each to carry $50,000 interest free payable at the expiration of 12 months, and the balance of the purchase price in each case to be provided by Mr Klich and Dr Adams – the $12,000 holding deposit which had earlier been provided by Mr Klich was to be appropriated equally to the cost of each business.32 On the advice of accountants, Mr Klich and Dr Adams acquired shares in two shelf companies, one to be the purchaser in respect of the Brisbane business, and the other to be the purchaser in respect of the Melbourne business.33 Agreements for the sale of each business were signed on 15 February 1998, the vendor of the Brisbane business being Ms Quiambo and the purchaser Abaca, and the vendor of the Melbourne business being Mr Scarborough and the purchaser Abala.34 For present purposes, the following Special Conditions contained in the Agreement for Sale of the Brisbane business (Blue AB 222-232) should be noted: 
      
       
        
         
         “3. The Purchaser acknowledges that in entering this agreement he has not relied on any statement, representation, warranty or condition other than as specifically contained herein, made or given by the Vendor or by any person or agent on the vendor’s behalf.

         17 The vendor agrees to advance to the purchaser Vendor’s finance in the sum of Fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) without interest, to be repaid by the purchaser to the vendor at the expiration of twelve months from the date of completion of this contract. The sum of $50,000 shall be deducted from the amount payable by the purchaser on completion. It is further agreed that if payment is not paid on or before twelve months from the date of completion of this contract, then the amount then outstanding shall attract interest at the rate of 10% per annum on and from the day 12 months from completion of this contract until the date of repayment thereof. It is further agreed that the vendor may take whatever action is deemed necessary for the recovery of such sum as a liquidated debt due to the vendor”. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       In contrast to the Agreement for Sale of the Sydney businesses, the Agreement for Sale of the Brisbane business did not contain any warranty as to the average income over the three months prior to the Agreement for Sale being entered into. 
       
     35 The Agreement for Sale of the Melbourne business (Blue AB 233-244) contained Special Conditions which were identical in terms with those contained in Clauses 3, 4 (a), (b), 6 and 17 of the Agreement for Sale for the Brisbane business. As also was the case with the Agreement for Sale of the Brisbane business, the Agreement for Sale for the Melbourne business contained no Special Condition warranting the average income of the business over the previous three months.36 According to Mr Klich, almost immediately after the settlement of the purchase of the Brisbane and Melbourne businesses, the income from all the businesses began to fall dramatically. He said that on several occasions, he asked Mr Scarborough why the takings of the businesses were down, and was told by Mr Scarborough that he had had to change some staff, and there had also been some problems with the distribution of coupons, but he was reassured that the businesses would soon get better.37 By late February 1998, business was still slow, and Mr Scarborough told Mr Klich that he had renegotiated the monthly payments of vendor finance with Mr Quiambo. The renegotiated terms were set out in a letter from the solicitors for Mr Scarborough, Mr Quiambo and Ms Quiambo of 25 February 1998 (Blue AB 245-246), which also required that Mr Klich sign in favour of Mr Scarborough, Mr Quiambo and Ms Quiambo, a guarantee and indemnity (Blue AB 247-251) of the obligations of each of Ecrovest, Abala and Abaca for the balance of the purchase moneys. 38 In early March 1998, the office of the businesses was, at Mr Scarborough’s insistence, moved from his home at Dover Heights to premises at Kensington. When this was done the computer, which had been in the office in Mr Scarborough’s home, was also moved. According to Mr Klich, there appeared to be no financial records of any of the businesses on paper at the new office, the only such records which he could find being on the hard drive of the computer.39 It was at about this time when Mr Scarborough telephoned Mr Klich and told him that he (Mr Scarborough) needed a holiday, and that one of the carpet cleaning contractors would be able to take over the management of the business while he was on holiday. 40 Mr Scarborough left to go on holidays in early April 1998, supposedly for a period of three or four weeks, but he never returned to take over the management of the business again. 41 After Mr Scarborough left, the takings of the three businesses continued to decline, so that they were either barely breaking even, or making losses. 42 Ultimately the Melbourne business was sold, an Agreement for Sale dated 16 March 1999 for a price of $29,000, the assets included in the price, including three Toyota Lite Ace vans, five carpet cleaning machines, four cleaning wands and two duct cleaning machines, including compressors. The Sydney and Brisbane businesses appear to have been closed down, not sold, but the materials which are before the Court do not disclose when that occurred.43 Before the Melbourne business had been sold, and the Sydney and Brisbane businesses closed down, however, Mr Klich had discovered a number of documents relating to each of the various businesses, which documents led him to believe that spreadsheet files on the hard drive of the office computer falsified the takings of each of the various businesses.44 It was Mr Klich’s case – and, thus, the case of all the Respondents – that, if he had been shown the true figures for the Gross Takings of each of the various businesses, he would never have agreed to the purchase of those businesses. 45 In addition to the materials which had led Mr Klich to believe that the spreadsheet files, which were on the hard drive of the office computer, falsified the takings of the various businesses, there were other materials tendered at trial, which cast more than a shadow of doubt over the accuracy of the various documents which had been given to Mr Klich by Ms Fardouly and Mr Scarborough, and as to the various oral representations, which they, or either of them, had made to Mr Klich.46 Among those additional materials were Mr Quiambo’s Income Tax Returns for the Income Tax years 1995/1996 and 1996/1997, which revealed the following: 
      
       
       (a) The Income Tax Return for 1995/1996 (Blue AB 726-731) disclosed: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (i) that the Sydney carpet cleaning business commenced to operate during that tax year; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (ii) that the Gross Income of the business in that tax year was $10,528; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (iii) that the Total Expenses of that business, which expenses did not include any provision for Commission or Wages, amounted to $24,457; 
         
        
       
      (iv) that the Total Business Loss was $13,929. 
      
       
       (b) The Income Tax Return for the 1996/1997 year (Blue AB 732-739) revealed the following: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (i) that the Gross income from the carpet cleaning business for that year was $171,000 – a weekly average of a little more than $3,288;  
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (ii) that the Total Expenses for that year, which expenses made no provision for Commissions, but made provision for “Salaries, Wages” of $31,340 were $172,187 – a weekly average of a little over $3,311; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (iii) that the Total Business Loss from the carpet cleaning business was $1,187; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (iv) that the pest control business commenced during that tax year; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (v) that the Gross Income for that business for that year was $11,696; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (vi) that the Total Expenses for that business, which expenses made no provision for Commissions or Wages, amounted to $11,648; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       (vii) that the Net Income from that business was $48; 
       
      
      
       
       (viii) that the Net Loss from both businesses was $1,139. 
       
     47 Also included among those additional materials were Mr Scarborough’s Income Tax Returns for the years 1995/1996: 
      
       
       (a) the Return for 1995-1996 (Blue AB 644-647): 
       
      
      
       
       (i) described Mr Scarborough as “Cleaner/Unemployed”; 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (ii) disclosed Mr Scarborough’s Total Taxable Income for that year as $6,409, of which $4,095 was attributed to an employer described as “A A A Accurate Pest”; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       (b) The Return for the Year 1996/1997 (Blue AB 648- 654): 
       
      
      
       
       (i) described Mr Scarborough as “Cleaner/Unemployed”; 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (ii) disclosed the receipt from Mr Quiambo, as an employer, of $29,000, from which Tax Instalments of $6,453.60 had been deducted; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (iii) disclosed that Mr Scarborough was carrying on a cleaning business under the name of “Abaca Cleaning”, which business had commenced to operate during that year; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (iv) disclosed that the Gross Income from that business for that year was $9,019; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (v) disclosed that the Total Expenses of that business, which expenses made no provisions for Commissions or Wages, amounted to $27,303; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       (vi) disclosed that the Total Business Loss was $18,284; 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (vii) disclosed that Mr Scarborough’s Taxable Income for the year was $10,716; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (viii) disclosed that the Taxable Income of Mr Scarborough’s wife for that year was $17,243 – given the date on which the Brisbane cleaning business is said to have commenced, this Income may have represented income from that business. 
         
        
       
     48 Those additional materials also contained a Schedule (Blue AB 678) as to the various business names of which Mr Scarborough, Mr Quiambo and Ms Quiambo were from time to time registered. That Schedule disclosed: 
      
       
       (a) that 1 AAA ABest Cleaning (one of the business names for the Sydney carpet business), was first registered in July 1993, the original proprietor being Mr Scarborough’s mother, and Mr Quiambo being registered as the Proprietor for the period 26 February 1996 to 31 October 1997; 
       
      
      
       
       (b) that AAA Abala Cleaning (the other of the business names for the Sydney carpet business), was first registered on 15 May 1996, Mr Quiambo being the Registered Proprietor between that date and 31 October 1997; 
       
      
      
       
       (c) that AAA ABA Pest Control (the business name for the Sydney pest control business), was first registered on 4 April 1997, Mr Quiambo being the Registered Proprietor between that date and 31 October 1997; 
       
      
      
       
       (d) that AA Abala Cleaning Services (the business name for the Brisbane carpet cleaning business) was registered, at first in the name of Mr Scarborough, and, shortly thereafter, in the name of Ms Quiambo in July 1996, the business being said to have commenced to operate on 1 August 1996; 
       
      
      
       
       (e) that AAA Abaca Cleaning (the business name for the Melbourne carpet cleaning business, which business was said to have commenced to operate on 31 December 1996), was registered on 24 January 1997, Mr Scarborough being the Registered Proprietor from that date until 16 February 1998. 
       
     49 The details revealed by this Schedule would indicate that the history as to the various businesses, contained in the “Details of Business” documents handed to Mr Klich by Ms Fardouly in June and in September 1997, are inaccurate. Thus, to suggest, in June 1997, that the Sydney carpet cleaning business had been established for two years by the founder, when Mr Quiambo did not become registered as the Proprietor of the Business Names until February and May 1997, is clearly false. Further, to suggest, in September 1997, that the Brisbane carpet cleaning business had been established for two years by the founder, when the Business Name was not registered until 23 July 1996, and the business did not commence to operate until 1 August 1996, is clearly false. Further still, to suggest, in September 1997, that the Melbourne carpet cleaning business had been established for one year, when the business is said not to have commenced to operate until 31 December 1996, is equally clearly false.50 Finally, the Financial Statements of both Abala and Abaca, although no doubt attracting the usual comment that the Income and Expenses of a successor in business do not necessarily provide any guide to what was the Income and what were the Expenses of the predecessor in that business, nonetheless provide some support for the other evidence suggesting that the information contained in the various “Details of Business” documents, and the representations made to Mr Klich by Mr Scarborough and Ms Fardouly, were false: 
      
       
       (a) the Profit and Loss Statement of Abala for the year 1997/1998 (Blue AB 628) – in which period Abala operated the Brisbane carpet cleaning business for only 19 weeks – discloses: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (i) Gross Fees and Charges of $79,385.75, a weekly average of a little over $4,178; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (ii) the Expenses for the same period, which expenses included advertising of $25,187.62, and provision for “subcontractors/wages” of $39,555.80, amounted to $86,680.52, a weekly average of a little over $4,562; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       (iii) The Net Operating Loss was $7,286.12; 
       
      
      
       
       (b) The Profit and Loss Statement of Abaca for the same period (Blue AB 639) reveals: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (i) Fees and Charges of $74,821.85, a weekly average of a little less than $3,938; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (ii) the Expenses for the same period, which included advertising of $36,177.91, and Provision for Salaries of $1,200 and Sub-contractors of $31,726.33, totalled $90,624.91 – a weekly average of a little less than $4,770; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       (iii) The Net Operating Loss was $15,794.11. 
       
     51 As will be seen, in each case the Gross Receipts are significantly lower than those contained in the “Details of Business” documents and the “Gross Margin” – the phrase which, in the context I have taken to mean that proportion of the income left after deduction of subcontractors’ commissions and, perhaps, wages, is, in each case, significantly less than the figure of 70% given in the “Details of Business Documents”.52 In her judgment, Sidis DCJ, after recording the general nature of the proceedings, and after recording, in summary form, the history leading up to the proceedings, and the varying versions of what occurred, which were given by the witnesses called on each side, turned first to deal with what she described as “issues of credit”. In this respect she commenced that part of her judgment as follows: (Red AB 28-29): 
      
       
        
         
         “3.1 It is important in this matter to keep in mind that the plaintiffs claim false representations, misleading and deceptive conduct in respect of all defendants and, in addition, fraud in respect of Mr Scarborough. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         There was much evidence, claim and counterclaim concerning conduct prior to and after the sales of the businesses, particularly that of Mr Klich and Mr Scarborough, which went to issues of credit but not to the extent to which representations made were untrue. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         3.2 It is necessary to deal with the issues of credit before proceeding to the determination of the plaintiffs’ claims because there is a very strong conflict on the evidence between the parties. I therefore need to determine, if possible, as between them which version of events is to be accepted”. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
        
       
     53 Then, having dealt with each of the witnesses called on each side, in the light, in particular, of the various attacks which had been made upon one or other of them, her Honour concluded this part of her judgment as follows (RAB 38): 
      
       
        
         
         “3.9  
         Findings on Credit 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         Overall I have reached the conclusion that I can place no reliance on the evidence of the defendants and their witnesses. Their evidence left me with no doubt that there had been a conscious effort on the part of the defendants and their witnesses to deceive the Court as to the real facts surrounding the sale of the businesses. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         I have therefore concluded that where there is a dispute on the evidence between the witnesses for the plaintiffs and those from the defendants, I should accept the evidence called for the plaintiffs”. 
         
        
       
     54 Having done so, Sidis DCJ then turned to deal with what she described as “the representations”, in this respect dealing separately with the representations claimed to have been made in respect of each of the four businesses the subject of the several Agreements for Sale. 55 In para 4.1 of her judgment, (RAB 38-40), her Honour identified the representations claimed against Mr Scarborough and Ms Fardouly, in respect of the Sydney carpet cleaning business, as being: 
      
       
       (1) Gross Sales of at least $12,000-$14,000 per week; 
       
      
      
       
       (2) Average Net Profit of at least $12,000-$14,000 per week; 
       
      
      
       
       (3) The business was very profitable; 
       
      
      
       
       (4) Future entries in the Yellow Pages were booked and paid for, 
       
      
      
       
       as she did so, recording the evidence which had been tendered in respect of each representation. 
       
     56 Having done so her Honour concluded (RAB 40 ): 
      
       
        
         
         “(5) Findings 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
          
           
           I find that the representations referred to in paragraphs 4.1(1), (2) and (3) were made to Mr Klich by Mr Scarborough and Ms Fadouly. I find that those representations were false. I find that those representations were misleading and deceptive and made in breach of s 42 of the Fair Trading Act 1987. 
           
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
          
           
           I find that the claimed representation in respect of the future entries in the Yellow Pages has not been proved. For this reason this aspect of the plaintiffs’ claims fails.” 
           
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
        
       
     57 When dealing earlier with the representation identified as 4.1 (4), Sidis DCJ had written (RAB 40): 
      
       
        
         
         “The Contract for Sale of the Sydney carpet business deals with (sic) specifically with the position with the Yellow Pages advertising. In that respect, therefore, the contract superseded any verbal representations on this aspect. There is no evidence from which I could conclude that the contract did not accurately represent the position concerning the Yellow Pages advertising”. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       The particular condition in the Sale Agreement relating to the Sydney businesses, to which her Honour thus referred, was as follows, (Blue AB 191-192): 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         “18  
         Yellow Pages 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         The Purchaser agrees that the Vendors (sic) has paid the first of five installment (sic) (5x $3,000) of the cost of the Yellow Page Directory ad for 1998. The Purchaser agrees that not withstanding (sic) any other provisions in the contract the Pucchaser (sic) will be responsible for the payment of the remaining installments (sic) when they fall due”. 
         
        
       
     58 In para 4.2 of her judgment, Sidis DCJ turned to the representations claimed in respect of the Sydney pest control business, which representations she identified as being: 
      
       
       (1) Average Gross Sales of $5,500 per week; 
       
      
      
       
       (2) Average Net Profit of $1,850 per week; 
       
      
      
       
       (3) The business was very profitable; 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (4) The financial figures provided by Ms Fardouly were true financial figures; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       dealing, as before, with the evidence tendered on each side in respect of each.  
       
     59 Having done so, her Honour concluded this part of her judgment, as follows (RAB 42): 
      
       
        
         
         “(5)  
         Findings 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         I find that the representations referred to in paragraphs 4.2 (1), (2), (3) and (4) were made to Mr Klich by Mr Scarborough and Ms Fardouly. I find that those representations were false. I find that those representations were misleading and deceptive and made in breach of s 42 of the Fair Trading Act 1987”. 
         
        
       
     60 Under a heading, “Additional Claim Against Mr Scarborough”, Sidis DCJ wrote (RAB 42-43): 
      
       
        
         
         “5.1 In addition to the claims referred to in paragraphs 4.1 and 4.2, it was claimed that Mr Scarborough made the representations knowing them to be false and therefore fraudulently. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         In support of this claim the plaintiffs relied upon: 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (1) documents, apparently records of the businesses located by Mr Klich in about June 1998; and 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (2) the absence of evidence of any substantial cash flow to Mr Scarborough in 1997; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (3) the absence of evidence of any substantial cash flow to Mr Quiambo in 1997 or 1998; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (4) evidence of a downturn in the takings of the businesses immediately after the date of the sale of the Brisbane and Melbourne businesses”. 
         
        
       
     61 Under this heading, her Honour turned, first, to deal with one aspect of the material in relation to the Sydney pest control business, which had been supplied to Mr Klich by Ms Fardouly prior to the sale of the business. Included in that material were a number of spreadsheets (Blue AB 160-172) relating to that business, which spreadsheets indicated that, during the period 29 June-27 September 1997, there were two contractors working in the business, one Mark Daniel, being designated as the Blue Contractor, and one Gareth Pearce, being designated as the Red Contractor.62 Records kept by Mr Daniel indicated that the spreadsheets overstated the returns to the business from Mr Daniel’s operations, while records kept by Mr Pearce established that he did not commence to work for the business until 6 September 1997.63 In the light of the evidence given by Mr Daniel and Mr Pearce, her Honour wrote (RAB 44): 
      
       
        
         
         “Notwithstanding the suggestions that Mr Daniel and Mr Pearce should not be accepted I find that there is unchallenged evidence that until 6 September 1997 only one pest control van was operating and that the Sydney pest control business received no income from Mr Pearce as a contractor until that date. I also find that the figures provided to Mr Klich overstated the income received from Mr Daniel’s operations as a contractor to the Sydney pest control business”. 
         
        
       
     64 Sidis DCJ then turned to the Sydney carpet cleaning business, in respect of which she wrote (RAB 44-45): 
      
       
        
         
         “There were discrepancies between the materials contained in a folder titled ‘Past Daily Summary Sheets’ and spreadsheets retrieved from the computer which were identical to records contained in a box of records produced by Mr Scarborough. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         The extent of the claimed discrepancies was set out in a compilation. These figures related to the period from 1 October 1997 to 1 November 1997. They therefore do not relate to the period shown in the Details of Business. However, they do relate to the period of turnover referred to in the warranty contained in Clause 16 of the Contract for Sale of the Sydney carpet cleaning business. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         I have already rejected Mr Scarborough’s explanation of these discrepancies in paragraph 3.7 (5).  
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         I find that those spreadsheets misrepresented those figures”. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       The “compilation” to which her Honour referred was Exhibit S1 (Blue AB 604-608). 
       
     65 In respect of the Melbourne business, Sidis DCJ wrote (RAB 45): 
      
       
        
         
         “Mr Klich stated he located some of the historical records of the Melbourne business whilst packing in the course of moving the office. A second compilation was said to highlight the discrepancies between those records and the computer spread sheet representations of turnover provided to Mr Klich and Dr Adams in respect of the Melbourne business.  
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         Some of the spread sheets comprising the historical records bear the heading ‘Melbourne’ in handwriting identified by Mr Scarborough as his own.  
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         A banking book from Melbourne was claimed by the plaintiffs to demonstrate that the Gross Turnover of the Melbourne business was substantially below the $7,225 represented in the Details of Business. The book was consistent with a facsimile from a Melbourne employee to Mr Scarborough which gave details of the turnover for the week ending 8 February 1998, one week prior to the sale of the Melbourne business. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         I find that this material evidences an over-statement of the takings of the Melbourne business in the materials provided to Mr Klich and Dr Adams prior to the purchase of that business”. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       (The compilation referred to was Exhibit S2 (Blue AB 609-621)). 
       
     66 In relation to the Brisbane business, Sidis DCJ wrote (RAB 46): 
      
       
        
         
         “As with the Melbourne business, the job charts for the Brisbane business contained computer sheets which do not accord with the computer sheets given to Mr Klich and Dr Adams prior to their purchase of the Brisbane business. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         Again, the discrepancies suggest inflation of the figures provided to them. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         I find this material to be evidence of overstatement of the takings of the Brisbane business in the documents provided to Mr Klich and Dr Adams prior to the purchase by Abaca”. 
         
        
       
     67 When she turned to deal with Mr Scarborough’s cash flow, Sidis DCJ (at RAB 46), extracted from Mr Scarborough’s Tax Returns for the taxation years ended 30 June 1996 and 30 June 1997, the details to which I have earlier (see para 47 (above)) referred.68 When she came to deal with Mr Quiambo’s cash flow, Sidis DCJ first (RAB 47) extracted the material from Mr Quiambo’s Income Tax Returns for the tax years ended 30 June 1996 and 30 June 1997, to which I have earlier (see para 46 (above)) referred, and then continued (RAB 47-48): 
      
       
        
         
         “5.8 It was claimed by Mr Scarborough that the Sydney carpet cleaning business returned no income in the 1996 and 1997 tax years because of set up costs and the need for expenditure on research. His assertion was that the profits were about to flow from the end of June 1997. This is, of course, contrary to the assertions contained in the Details of Business. It is also contrary to the evidence of Mr Quiambo, said to be the owner of the Sydney businesses, that the businesses returned a profit within a matter of weeks of being established.  
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         5.9 Figures were produced which indicated a gradual decline in the takings of each of the businesses from 15 February 1998, more accelerated after Mr Scarborough left the Sydney businesses in April 1998. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         In addition the plaintiffs pointed to the willingness of the vendors of the businesses to agree to a reduction in the amount to be paid in respect of the vendor finance. It is claimed that this is indicative of an acknowledgement by the vendors of a downturn in the takings of the businesses”. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
        
       (The figures, to which her Honour referred in para 5.9, are to be found in respect of the Sydney carpet cleaning business at Blue 445-446, and in relation to the Sydney pest control business, at Blue 447-448.) 
       
     69 Having dealt with the various matters upon which the respondents had relied to establish fraud on the part of Mr Scarborough, her Honour then turned to “The Law Relating to Proof of Claims in Fraud”.70 Under a heading “Reliance”, her Honour wrote (RAB 48): 
      
       
        
         
         “I accept that it is essential that the plaintiffs establish that they relied on the representations claimed to have been made when they decided to proceed with their respective purchases. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         It was argued that they had not in fact relied on these representations because, after receipt of the Details of Business and the computer printouts, further enquiries and observations had been made, particularly by Mr Klich.  
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         The very purpose of those documents was to induce potential purchasers into proceeding to a contract. There is clear evidence that the representations made by Ms Fardouly and Mr Scarborough orally and through the documentary materials provided to Mr Klich induced him to go forward. There is no credible evidence that he was told in the course of negotiations that the figures were inaccurate in that they overstated the takings of the businesses. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         In fact, Mr Scarborough claimed that to the extent that the representations as to the takings of the businesses were inaccurate, they understated them”. 
          
         
        
       
     71 Then, after a reference to what was said by Wilson J in Gould v Vaggelas ((1985) 157 CLR, 236; 56 ALR 31, 46; see to the like effect Australian Steel & Mining Corporation Pty Limited v Corben [1974] 2 NSWLR 202, 207-209, per Hutley JA), her Honour continued: 
      
       
        
         
         “I accept this as a correct statement of the law relating to reliance. I find that the plaintiffs relied on the representations in making their decisions to proceed with the purchases of the businesses”. 
         
        
       
     72 Under the heading, “Standard of Proof”, Sidis DCJ wrote (RAB 49): 
      
       
        
         
         “In suggesting that the claim of fraud had not been proved, it was pointed out by the defendants that the defendants’ figures represented in respect of the Sydney businesses were in fact maintained from 31 October 1997 until at least the end of December 1997 as evidenced by payments made to Mr Klich during this period. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         Mr Klich agreed that, with the exception of the slow Christmas and New Year period, the takings of the Sydney businesses were in accordance with the representations up to the point of sale of the Melbourne and Brisbane businesses. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         It was argued that the takings were never as great as represented but that Mr Scarborough in the course of a deliberate fraud had created the impression that of takings greater than were in fact received for the purpose of inducing Mr Klich and Dr Adams to proceed with the purchase of the Melbourne and Brisbane businesses. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         It was argued by the defendants that a heavier onus of proof was imposed on the plaintiffs in respect of their claims of fraud against Mr Scarborough”. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       Then, after a reference to various authorities, and, in particular, to the decision of the High Court in  
       Neat Holdings Pty Limited v Karajan Holdings Pty Limited  
       ((1992) 67 ALJR 170; 110 ALR 449), her Honour, after referring to a passage in the joint judgment of Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane and Gaudron JJ in  
       Neat Holdings Pty Limited v Karajan Holdings Pty Limited  
       (ALJR at 449-450), concluded (RAB 50): 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         “In summary, the law requires that: 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (1) evidence on the question of fraud must be clear and cogent; and 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (2) the Court should not lightly make a finding that, on the balance of probabilities, a defendant has been guilty of fraudulent conduct”. 
         
        
       
     73 Her Honour then recorded her “Findings on the claim of fraud”, as follows (RAB 51): 
      
       
        
         
         “I have already made findings in paragraphs 4.1 (5) and 4.2 (5) concerning false, misleading and deceptive representations.  
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         In rejecting Mr Scarborough’s explanation and arriving at those findings, it is implicit that he knew that the representations made were false. Much of the material provided to Mr Klich and Dr Adams I find to have been deliberately falsified with a view to inflating the prices that could be commanded on the sale of the businesses. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         The manner by which the takings for the first two or three months after the sale of the Sydney businesses were as recorded is irrelevant to the question of whether the materials provided to Mr Klich and Dr Adams concerning the historical records of the business had been falsified. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         I find clear and cogent evidence of deliberate falsification of the records of the businesses. I find that those falsified records were supplied to Mr Klich and Dr Adams for the purpose of inducing them to proceed with the purchase of the businesses. I find that they relied upon them for the purpose of deciding to proceed with the purchase of the businesses. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         I find the claim in fraud against Mr Scarborough proved”. 
         
        
       
     74 It should be noted here, that, when she dealt with the question of the representations – whether for the purposes of the provisions of the Fair Trading Act 1987, or the claim of fraudulent misrepresentation raised against Mr Scarborough – Sidis DCJ did not deal with the relevance, or otherwise, of the provisions of conditions (3), (4) (a), (b), and (6) of each of the Agreements for Sale. In their Notice of Appeal (RAB 67-71), the Appellants did not assert that her Honour erred in not holding that, by reason of the provisions of those conditions, the Respondents were not entitled to rely on any of the alleged misrepresentations. That fact notwithstanding, in their Written Submissions (Orange AB 12), the Appellants have sought to assert that “reliance upon the pre-contractual representations was disallowed by the purchaser when it acknowledged in cl 3 of the Sydney contract that it had not relied on any statement, representation or warranty other than as specifically contained in the Contract (RAB 51T). The Melbourne and Brisbane Contracts (signed on 15.2.98 contained identical clauses)” despite the fact that it would appear that no such submission was advanced on behalf of the Appellants at trial. It should, however, be noted that at common law, a plaintiff who, in deciding to enter into a contract, was acting upon a representation made by the defendant, which representation has been made fraudulently, is not to be held bound by a provision such as that contained in cl 3, 4 (a), (b) of the Agreements for Sale (S. Pearson & Son Limited v Lord Mayor &c of Dublin [1907] AC 351), and, further, that the courts have been consistent in ruling that attempts to exclude liability for breach of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) s 52, or its Fair Trading Act equivalents, will be unsuccessful. That this is so is demonstrated by the following passage in the judgment of Sheppard J, with whom Fox J and, in this respect, Jackson J, agreed in Clark Equipment Australia Limited v Covcat Pty Limited ((1986-1987) 71 ALR 367, 371)): 
      
       
        
         
         “Parties may agree that statements and representations made antecedently to their entering into a contract are not to form the basis of any remedy in the event of there being a subsequent disagreement. Except in cases of fraud, the common law will give effect to their contract. But the remedy conferred by s 52 of the Trade Practices Act will not be lost, whatever the parties may provide in their agreement. If a vendor of goods has engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct, the law makes him accountable for loss and damage suffered as a result of his unlawful conduct. That conduct will usually have been committed, as in this case, prior to the signing of any contract. If, as a result of the conduct, a person is induced to enter into a contract and suffers loss, an action to recover it lies. The terms of the contract are irrelevant. As Wilcox J said in  
         Petera Pty Ltd v EAJ Pty Ltd 
          (1985) 7 FCR 375 at 378: 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
          
           
           ‘Whatever may be the effect of cl 19 (the exemption clause in that case) in relation to an action brought in contract, in which reliance is placed upon an alleged warranty or condition not included in the contract of sale, that clause should not be allowed to defeat a claim based upon s 52. To permit such a clause to defeat such a claim would be to accept the possibility that a vendor might exacerbate his deception, as by actively misleading a purchaser as to the existence or nature of such an exclusion, and thereby ensure that he would escape liability’. 
           
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         I refer also to  
         Byers v Dorotea Pty Ltd 
          (1986) 69 ALR 715; [1987] ATPR 40-760, per Pincus J at 48-230”. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       So, too, in  
       Henjo Investments Pty Ltd v Collins (Marrickville) Pty Ltd  
       ((1987-1988) 79 ALR 83, 98-99), Lockhart J, with whom Burchett J and, on this aspect of the matter, Foster J, agreed, said: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         “Irrespective of the construction of these two special conditions it does not matter ultimately whether the impugned conduct with which this case was concerned falls literally within them or not. Section 52 is a section in the consumer protection provisions of an Act concerned to protect the public from misleading or deceptive conduct and unfair trade practices which may result in contravention of the Act. It has been held that exclusion clauses of which Special Conditions 6 and 7 are examples, cannot operate to defeat claims under s 52. It may be, as the judgment of Sweeney J in  
         P J Berry Estates Pty Ltd v Mangalone Homestead Pty Ltd 
          (1984) 6 ATPR 40-459 at 45, 638 suggests, that such exclusion clauses will generally be ineffective because they cannot break the nexus between the conduct in contravention of s 52 and the making of the agreement in issue. Where the conduct of the defendant is alleged to be fraudulent in character, then an exclusion clause will be no more effective to defeat the action than it would be effective if the action were brought in the tort of deceit in relation to conduct antecedent to the contract:  
         Commercial Banking Co of Sydney Ltd v R H Brown & Co 
          (1972) 126 CLR 337, per Menzies J at 344;  
         Petera Pty Ltd v EAJ Pty Ltd 
          (1985) ATPR 40-605, per Wilcox J at 46, 887: see also Terry: ‘Disclaimers and Deceptive Conduct’ (1986) Australian Business Law Review p 478 at 486. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         There are wider objections to allowing effect to such clauses. Otherwise the operation of the Act, a public policy statute, could be ousted by private agreement. Parliament passed the Act to stamp out unfair or improper conduct in trade or in commerce; it would be contrary to public policy for Special Conditions such as those with which this Contract was concerned to deny or prohibit a statutory remedy for an offending contract under the Act. There are various judgments of Judges of this Court where this approach has been adopted and they are collected in the judgment of the trial Judge, so I need not repeat them”. 
         
        
       
     75 Having dealt with the claims based on the provisions of s 42 of the Fair Trading Act 1987 and, in the case of Mr Scarborough, fraudulent misrepresentation, Sidis DCJ then proceeded to deal with the Respondents’ claims, in so far as they were based in breach of contract. In this regard, her Honour held (RAB 51-52), that in so far as, in special Condition 3 of each of the relevant Agreements for Sale, the relevant vendor warranted “the fee basis of the business” as “being correct as at the date of this Deed”, each of the relevant vendors had been guilty of a breach of contract. Although her Honour’s reasons for so concluding are not spelt out in this part of her judgment, it seems tolerably plain that her Honour proceeded upon the basis that the relevant “fee base of the business” was that which had been stated to be the “Gross Sales” in each of the relevant “Details of Business” documents. In addition, her Honour held that there had been a breach of Condition (16) of the Agreement for Sale of the Sydney businesses, which condition, as I have earlier (see para 26 (above)) recorded was to the effect that the average income over the proceeding three months was approximately $16,000 per week, a figure which, even if one aggregated the gross fees of the Sydney carpet cleaning business and the Sydney pest control business were not, in her Honour’s view, made out.76 Her Honour, accordingly, held (RAB 52) on the claim for breach of contract: 
      
       
       (1) Mr Quiambo was in breach of the warranty set out in Special Conditions (3) and (16) of the Contract for Sale of the Sydney businesses; 
       
      
      
       
       (2) Mr Scarborough was in breach of the warranty set out in Special Condition (3) of the Contract for Sale of the Melbourne business; and 
       
      
      
       
       (3) Ms Quiambo was in breach of the warranty set out in Special Condition (3) of the Contract for Sale of “the Melbourne” (sic) business. 
       
     77 Sidis DCJ then turned to the question of the parties liable for damages, a question which, at least to some extent, seems to have arisen by reason of what appears to have been a submission advanced on behalf of the Respondents, that all the businesses were owned by Mr Quiambo, a submission which her Honour rejected by finding (RAB 52): 
      
       
       (1) That Mr Quiambo was the beneficial owner of the Sydney businesses;  
       
      
      
       
       (2) That Mr Scarborough was the beneficial owner of the Melbourne business; and 
       
      
      
       
       (3) That Ms Quiambo was the beneficial owner of the Brisbane business. 
       
     78 Her Honour then recorded her findings in this respect as follows (RAB 53-54): 
      
       
        
         
         “7.3 I find Mr Quiambo liable in damages to Ecrovest in respect of: 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (1) false representations made on his behalf by Mr Scarborough and Ms Fardouly in the course of the sale of the Sydney businesses; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (2) misleading and deceptive conduct of Mr Scarborough and Ms Fardouly executed on his behalf in the course of the sale of the Sydney businesses; and 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (3) breach of warranties contained special conditions 3 and 16 of the contracts (sic) for sale of the Sydney businesses. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         7.4 I find Mr Scarborough liable in damages to Ecrovest, Abaca and Abala in respect of: 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (1) false representations made by him and Ms Fardouly in the course of the sale of the businesses; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (2) misleading and deceptive conduct executed by him and Ms Fardouly in the course of the sale of the businesses; and 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (3) fraudulent conduct executed by him in the course of the sale of the businesses. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         In addition I find Mr Scarborough liable in damages in respect of the breach of the warranty contained in special condition 3 of the contract for the sale of the Melbourne business. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         7.5 I find Ms Quiambo liable in damages to Abala in respect of: 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (1) false representations made on her behalf by Mr Scarborough and Ms Fardouly in the course of the sale of the Brisbane business; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (2) misleading and deceptive conduct of Mr Scarborough and Ms Fardouly executed on her behalf in the course of the sale of the Brisbane business; and 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (3) breaches of the warranties (sic) contained in special conditions (sic) 3 and 16 (sic) of the Contracts (sic) for Sale of the Brisbane business. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         7.6 In relation to Ms Fardouly it was argued that she acted in good faith and was unaware that the representations made were false. It was claimed that she was merely passing on information provided to her by Mr Scarborough. I accept that there is no evidence to suggest that Ms Fardouly knew of the falsification of the materials provided to her by Mr Scarborough. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         On this basis she will be held liable in damages only in respect of the breaches of the Fair Trading Act 1987”. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
        
       (I record, here, that her Honour’s finding, that Ms Quiambo was in breach of a warranty contained in Special Condition 16 of the Agreement for Sale of the Brisbane business, was clearly in error, as that Agreement did not contain any such Condition.) 
       
     79 Sidis DCJ then proceeded to deal with the question of damages. In this respect, having referred to some evidence which was tendered on behalf of the respondents, she continued (RAB 54-56): 
      
       
        
         
         “8.4 It is claimed that the Ecrovest accounts indicate that substantial losses were incurred by the Sydney businesses from the date of acquisition on 1 November 1997 up to 30 June 1998. An amount of $36,031 is claimed for this period. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         A loss of $15,794.11 is claimed for Abaca to 30 June 1998 and $7,286.12 for Abala to 30 June 1998. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         This is the extent of the evidence of damage suffered in respect of the businesses.  
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         8.5 No valuations have been prepared of the true value of the businesses at the date of their acquisition. The reason for this, the plaintiffs argue, is that, in the absence of any accurate figures as to the turnover and net returns of the businesses, it is not possible to arrive at a true value.  
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         Additionally they reason that the businesses never ran at a profit and therefore must be assessed as worthless. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         They therefore argue that a broader approach to damages be taken, namely a finding that by reason of the fraud on the part of Mr Scarborough, the contracts for sale of the businesses be declared void. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         They also seek the return of the purchase monies, the recovery of trading losses to 30 June 1998 and interest on a compounding basis. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         8.6 Certainly the law allows for this approach. The question is whether it would be appropriate in this particular case. The difficulties which arise are: 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (1) the Melbourne business has been sold with the plant and equipment; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (2) the Brisbane business has been closed down, with no evidence as to what has happened to the plant and equipment; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (3) it is now more than two years since the sale of the Sydney businesses; in that period changes have been made to the manner of operation of the businesses and to the plant and equipment used in them. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         8.7 For these reasons I do not consider it appropriate to set aside the Contracts for Sale. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         8.8 I do, however, accept that the evidence establishes that the value of the businesses was considerably overstated. The extent of the overstatement cannot be calculated because there are no records of the true takings and expenses of the businesses. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         Those records that do exist indicate that there was no profit in the businesses. I consider that, in the absence of accurate records, I should draw the inference that there was never any profit in the businesses. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         In those circumstances I propose to assess damages on the basis that the businesses were worthless. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         8.9 Damages will be allowed as follows: 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (1) the amounts shown in the contracts for sale of each business for goodwill will be allowed; no allowance is made for the plant and equipment purchased for the reasons set out in paragraph 8.6;  
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (2) the amounts claimed for trading losses to the end of June 1998 will be allowed; and 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (3) interest on these sums will be allowed on a compounding basis”. 
         
        
       
     80 Although Sidis DCJ did not then record the bases upon which she proposed to allow interest on a compounding basis, in a judgment delivered by her on 30 May 2000 (Orange AB 44-47), she wrote (Orange AB 46): 
      
       
        
         
         “(6) The orders which I now propose to make include sums calculated on the basis of compound interest on the damages suffered by the third, fourth and fifth plaintiffs as a result of the breaches by the defendants of their various contracts. It was argued on behalf of the defendants that this Court does not have the jurisdiction to award interest on a compounding basis.  
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         I have noted the provisions of s 83 A of the  
         District Court Act 1973 
          in particular the provision of s 83A(2)(a). However, I have relied on the authority of the High Court in  
         Hungerfords v Walker 
          (1989) 171 CLR 125 to allow the payment of compounding interest to the plaintiffs as an additional head of damage, rather than as an award of interest under the provisions of the  
         District Court Act 
         , for the loss of the use of their funds arising out of the breaches by the defendants of their contracts”. 
         
        
       
     81 Sidis DCJ concluded her judgment as follows (RAB 56-57): 
      
       
        
         
         “(9)  
         Parties Entitled to Recover 
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         9.1 Claims for damages are made by Mr Klich and Dr Adams in their personal capacities on the basis that they advanced funds to Ecrovest, Abaca and Abala for the purchase of the businesses. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         9.2 Those advances are shown as loans in the financial accounts. They are the result of private arrangements between Ecrovest, Abaca and Abala and Mr Klich and Dr Adams. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         9.3 I find therefore that Mr Klich and Dr Adams have no direct rights of recovery against the defendants. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         9.4 Damages will be awarded to Ecrovest, Abaca and Abala on the bases set out in Sections 7 and 8 of these reasons. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         10.  
         Cross-Claims 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         10.1 It follows that the cross-claims will be dismissed. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         10.2 They are based on claims for sums due in circumstances where the contracts which give rise to the liability for payment were entered into following misrepresentations, false statements, misleading and deceptive conduct and fraud”. 
         
        
       
     82 In the judgment which she delivered on 30 May 2000, Sidis DCJ made the following formal orders (Orange AB 46-47): 
      
       
        
         
          
         “(1) Verdict and judgment in favour of (Ecroves)t against Mr Scarborough, Mr Quiambo and Ms Fardouly for the sum of $177,867.72; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (2) Verdict and judgment in favour of (Abaca) against Mr Scarborough, Ms Quiambo and Ms Fardouly for the sum of $83,535.82; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (3) Verdict and judgment in favour of (Abala) against Mr Scarborough and Ms Fardouly for the sum of $23,392.58; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (4) (The claims of Mr Klich and Dr Adams) are dismissed; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (5) (The cross-claims of each of Mr Quiambo, Ms Quiambo and Mr Scarborough) are dismissed; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (6) The defendants are to pay the costs of Ecrovest, Abaca and Abala of their claims against the appellants on an indemnity basis together with interest thereon pursuant to the District Court’s Act 1973; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (7) The respondents were to pay the costs of the plaintiffs on the cross-claims on an indemnity basis together with interest thereon pursuant to the District Court Act 1973; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (8) Each of (Mr Klich and Dr Adams) and the defendants) were to pay their own costs of the claims (of Mr Klich and Dr Adams)”. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       Provision for a Stay of Execution was also made.  
       
     83 In the Notice of Appeal (RAB 67-71), which was filed on their behalf, the Appellants took the following Grounds of Appeal, not all of which were persisted in on the hearing of the appeal: 
      
       
        
         
         “(1) Her Honour erred in finding, against the weight of the evidence, that the Respondents relied upon the representations of the Appellants in deciding to purchase the business. 
          
          
         (2) Her Honour erred in finding that the representations were deliberately falsified for the purpose of inflating the prices that could be commanded for the sale of the businesses when there was no evidence to support such a finding of such a purpose. 
          
          
         (3) Her Honour erred in law in finding that there was clear and cogent evidence upon which a finding of fraud against the first Appellant could be made when there was no such evidence and consequently her Honour misdirected herself on the standard of proof which was required to find such a finding of fraud. 
          
          
         (4) Her Honour erred in finding that the Appellants breached their contracts with the respondents when she erroneously constructed (sic) Special Condition 3 of the respective contracts. 
          
          
         (5) Her Honour erred in law in finding that the businesses were worthless at the time of sale notwithstanding her finding that: 
          
          
           
           (a) The Parties had agreed that the figures for the Sydney businesses in the first and second months after the sale appeared to be similar to those represented prior to the sale. 
            
            
           (b) The First Respondent agreed that after the sale the takings of the Sydney business were in accordance with the representations which had been made. 
            
            
           (c) Cash profits of the businesses were applied to payments of instalments of the outstanding purchase price and to the purchase of two new vans for the Sydney business. 
            
            
           (d) There was a gradual decline in the takings of each of the businesses from the 15th February 1998. 
            
            
           (e) No valuations had been prepared of the true value of the businesses at the date of their acquisition. 
            
            
           (f) The Sydney businesses ran for more than two years from the date of sale. 
            
            
           (g) The Brisbane business was closed down with no evidence as to what had happened to the plant or equipment or the goodwill.  
            
            
           (h) Although the value of the businesses was considerably overstated, the extent of the overstatement could not be calculated because there were no records of the true takings and expenses of the businesses. 
            
           
          
         (6) Her Honour erred in finding that the businesses were worthless when on the evidence of the First Respondent as to the takings and activities of the businesses after sale it was not open for her to do so. 
          
          
         (7) Her Honour erred in law in awarding damages for the entire amount of the goodwill when the only evidence available was that the Sydney businesses were still trading at the date of trial, a competitor business had been set up by the first Respondent in Sydney and there was no evidence of what had happened to the goodwill of the Brisbane and Melbourne businesses after sale. 
          
          
         (8) Her Honour erred in law in admitting into evidence Exhibits X1, X2, YY1, and YY2 being a tape recording and transcripts of that recording and other recorded meetings which were clandestinely recorded by the first Respondent without the knowledge of the Appellants. 
          
          
         (9) Her Honour erred in the exercise of her discretion in failing to exclude the tape recording and transcripts from evidence because of the prejudicial nature of the material contained in those exhibits and the consequent unfairness which prevailed because of the use of that material in the course of trial. 
          
          
         (10) Her Honour erred in law in dismissing the Cross Claims when there was no evidence to support such a dismissal. 
          
          
         (11) Her Honour erred in awarding interest on the damages awarded to the respondents on a compound basis when such an award was contrary to section 83A (2)(a) of the  
         District Court Act 1973 
          and further, there was no evidence to support such an award of compound interest. 
          
          
         (12) Her Honour erred in ordering indemnity costs in the proceedings when there was no evidence to support the exercise of her Honour’s discretion in that way and no reasons were given by her Honour”, 
          
         
        
       and the Appellants sought the following orders: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         “(1) The Orders of Her Honour made on 30th May 2000 be set aside; 
          
          
         (2) A verdict and judgment for the Cross Claimants on the Cross Claim; 
          
          
         (3) A verdict and judgment for the Defendants; or 
          
          
         (4) Alternatively to Order 3, the remaining proceedings be remitted to the District Court for a new trial; 
          
          
         (5) The Respondents to pay the costs of this appeal and the proceedings in the Court below”. 
         
        
       
     84 In the Notice of Cross-Appeal (Orange AB 39-41), which was filed on their behalf, the Respondents raised the following Grounds of Appeal: 
      
       
        
         
         “(1) Having found fraud, misrepresentation and misleading and deceptive conduct as set out in the judgment, the learned trial Judge erred in dismissing the claims of (Mr Klich and Dr Adams). 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (2) Having found fraud, misrepresentation and misleading and deceptive conduct as set out in the judgment, the learned trial Judged erred in ordering that each of (Mr Klich and Dr Adams) and the Defendants pay their own costs of the claims of (Mr Klich and Dr Adams) and should have ordered the Defendants to pay the costs of (Mr Klich and Dr Adams) of their claims. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (3) Having found fraud, misrepresentation and misleading and deceptive conduct as set out in the judgment, the learned trial judged (sic) erred in failing to make orders pursuant to s 72 of the  
         Fair Trading Act 
          and s 135 of the  
         District Court Act  
         declaring void or varying the contracts involving (Ecrovest and Abaca), the subject of the proceedings, and consequently erred in the determining (sic) the quantum of damages payable to (Ecrovest and Abaca)”, 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       and sought the following Orders: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         “(5) An order setting aside orders 5 and 6 of the orders made by the learned trial judge on 30 May 2000. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         ………………………………………………………………. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (6) An order that the Cross-Respondents pay the costs (of Mr Klich and Dr Adams) of the action before the learned trial judge. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (7) An order setting aside Order 1 of the Orders made by the learned trial Judge on 30 May 2000 and in lieu thereof: 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
          
           
           (a) an order pursuant to s 72 of the  
           Fair Trading Act 
            declaring void the contract between (Ecrovest) and (Mr Quiambo) and/or an order setting that contract aside; and 
           
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
          
           
           (b) an order that (Mr Scarborough, Mr Quiambo and Ms Fardouly) pay to (Ecrovest) the sum of $267,583.67 together with interest thereon from 30 May 2000. 
           
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (8) An order setting aside order 2 of the orders made by the learned trial Judge on 30 May 2000 and in lieu thereof: 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
          
           
           (a) an order pursuant to s 72 of the  
           Fair Trading Act 
            declaring void the contract between (Abaca) and (Ms Quiambo) and/or an order setting that contract aside; and 
           
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
          
           
           (b) an order that (Mr Scarborough, Ms Quiambo and Ms Fardouly) pay damages to (Abaca) the sum of $130,743.27 together with interest thereon from 30 May 2000. 
           
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (9) An order that the Cross-Respondents pay the Cross-Appellants’ costs of the appeal”. 
         
        
       
     85 In addition to filing a Cross-Appeal, the Respondents filed a Notice of Contention (Orange AB 42-43), which was in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “(1) Subject to the matters raised in their Cross-Appeal, the Respondents contend that the decision and orders of the (sic) Her Honour Judge Sidis should be upheld on grounds as well as those relied upon by Her Honour Judge Sidis, namely: 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
          
           
           (a) Even if the tape recordings and the transcripts (and oral evidence relating to them) are disregarded entirely, the documentary evidence and the other oral evidence before Her Honour Judge Sidis demonstrated fraud on the part of (Mr Scarborough) and misleading and deceptive conduct on the part of each of the Appellants sufficient to found the orders made by Her Honour in favour of (Ecrovest, Abaca and Abala). 
           
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (2) The Respondents contend that the decision and order of Her Honour Judge Sidis that the cross-claims of (Mr Quiambo, Ms Quiambo and Mr Scarborough) be dismissed should be upheld on grounds as well as those relied upon by Her Honour Judge Sidis, namely: 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
          
           
           (a) On the evidence before Her Honour (Ecrovest, Abaca and Abala) were entitled to orders setting aside, declaring void or varying the contracts on which the cross-claims were founded with the effect of removing the contractual foundation for the cross-claims. Accordingly, the cross-claims were properly dismissed. 
           
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
          
           
           (b) Alternatively, there was a set-off available to the respondents (being a set-off which is, for practical purposes, already reflected in the amounts awarded by her Honour) which would have resulted in net amounts (sic) due under the cross-claims being a nil amount. Accordingly, the cross-claims were properly dismissed”. 
           
          
         
        
       
     86 When the Appeal and Cross-Appeal were listed for hearing, Mr M L D Einfeld QC appeared with Mr T J Morahan for the Appellants and Cross-Respondents, while Mr M J Lawler appeared for the Respondents and Cross-Appellants. 87 Despite the form of the Notice of Appeal which was filed on their behalf, the Written Submissions which were filed, and the oral submissions which were advanced, on behalf of the Appellants on the hearing, were more circumscribed. They might be summarised as follows: 
      
       
       (1) Liability could not be sustained as the Respondents had failed to establish relevant reliance, falsity of the asserted representations, contractual breach, and any loss caused by any conduct of the Appellants. 
       
      
      
       
       (2) The Respondents failed to establish relevant reliance since: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (a) the only representations capable of any causal connection with the loss (if any) suffered by the Respondents were those referable to the Gross Takings of the respective businesses; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (b) whatever may have been the representation as to Gross Takings of the Sydney businesses, that representation was superseded by the specific warranty in cl 16 of the Sydney Contract; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (c) in any event, reliance upon the pre-contractual representations was precluded by the provisions of cl 3 in each of the Agreements for Sale; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (d) in any event, the fact that Mr Klich had had an adequate opportunity to look at the businesses for months before they were purchased, and had regularly visited and observed their operation, systems records and the like, led to the conclusion that he had in fact not relied on any of the representations; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (e) while, insofar as the Respondents based their claim on the provisions of s 42 of the  
         Fair Trading Act 1987,  
         the provisions of cl 3 of each of the Agreements for Sale did not, in law, preclude reliance on provisions of that section, nonetheless, the fact that each of the Agreements for Sale did contain cl 3, indicated an absence of reliance upon the representations – reference was made to the decision of the Full Federal Court in  
         Leda Holdings Pty Limited v Oraka Pty Limited 
          ((1998) ATPR 
           
         41-601). 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       (3) In any event, the Respondents had failed to demonstrate that the representations, upon which they claimed to have relied, were false. 
       
       
      
       
       (4) Further, the Respondents failed to establish that any losses incurred by the Sydney businesses were caused by anything said, or done, by the Appellants. 
       
      
      
       
       (5) Just as the claims based upon misrepresentation, fraud and contract ought to have been dismissed, so also the claim based upon the provisions of s 42 of the  
       Fair Trading Act 1987  
       ought to have been dismissed for the reasons: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (a) if such a claim is to give rise to an entitlement to damages, a relevant causal nexus between the conduct and the damages asserted must be established – reference was made to the judgment of Mason CJ, Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ in  
         Wardley Australia Limited v Western Australia  
         ((1992) 175 CLR 512, 525) – and no such nexus had been established; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (b) the misrepresentations must have had a substantial, rather than a merely negligible, effect, and here the effect of the representations was merely speculative. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       (6) The trial Judge’s treatment of the damages question was also erroneous in that: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (a) the evidence dictated that the Respondents failed to prove any loss arising from their acquisition of the Sydney business which could be attributed in any way to the Appellants; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (b) insofar as the Melbourne and Brisbane businesses were concerned, the evidence, such as it was, could not support her Honour’s conclusion that those businesses never ran at a profit. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       (7) In awarding compound interest on damages, her Honour erred since: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (a) in the light of the prohibition contained in s 83A(2)(a) of the  
         District Court Act 1973,  
         such interest could not be awarded; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (b) no  
         Hungerfords  
         claim was ever pleaded, nor was there any relevant evidence. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       (8) The order for indemnity costs ought not to have been made, as there was no basis which would have justified the making of such an order, and, in any event, her Honour gave no reasons for making that order. 
       
     88 In so far as they related to the Cross-Appeal, the Written Submissions filed on behalf of the Respondents/Cross-Appellants were, in short, as follows: 
      
       
       (1) As to Grounds 1 and 2: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (a) it was entirely reasonable and proper for Mr Klich and Dr Adams to make separate claims against the Appellants in respect of the moneys they advanced to enable the purchase of the Melbourne and Brisbane businesses; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (b) in terms of an entitlement to recover on the ground of statutory misleading and deceptive conduct, it is irrelevant that the advances by Mr Klich and Dr Adams might be characterised as “private arrangements between Ecrovest, Abaca and Abala and Mr Klich and Dr Adams”, or that they had “no direct rights of recovery against the Defendants; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (c) having found for the corporate Plaintiffs, and ordered appropriate compensation, it may have been open for the trial Judge not to make a separate award of damages to Mr Klich and Dr Adams. However, it does not follow that their claims should have been dismissed with costs. A proper exercise of discretion was to order that the Appellants pay the costs of all the Respondents. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       (2) As to Ground 3: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (a) given the findings of fraud, and false, misleading and deceptive conduct, in relation to the sale of each of the three businesses, the learned trial Judge erred in refusing to set aside the Sydney and Brisbane Contracts; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (b) in approaching the grant of relief under statutory causes of action for misleading and deceptive conduct, the exercise of discretion to set aside a contract ought to be guided by equitable principles – reference was made to the judgment of the High Court in  
         Vadasz v Pioneer Concrete SA Pty Limited  
         ((1995) 184 CLR 102, 111); 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (c) in particular, the concern of equity, in moulding relief between the parties, is to prevent, nullify or provide compensation for, wrongful injury if it appears that the other party would not have entered into the contract at all if the true position were known, the contract may be set aside in its entirety – reference was made to  
         Vadasz v Pioneer Concrete (SA) Pty Limited  
         ((supra), at 115); 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (d) the Court will ordinarily set aside contracts obtained by fraud, subject to being able to craft orders that will prevent the defendant from enjoying the benefits of his fraud, provided orders can be crafted to ensure that the successful plaintiff does equity and does not obtain an unwarranted benefit at the expense of the defendant – reference was made to  
         Vadasz v Pioneer Concrete (SA) Pty Limited  
         ((supra), at 114). 
         
        
       
     89 I turn, then, to consider the submissions which have been advanced on behalf of the Appellants.90 As I have earlier (para 87 (above)) noted, the first submission advanced on behalf of the Appellants was that the Respondents had failed to establish a relevant reliance, whether the claim be based in fraud, or on the provisions of s 42 of the Fair Trading Act 1987. As is apparent from what I have earlier recorded, the principal basis for that submission was that the only representations capable of any causal connection with any loss suffered by the Respondents, were those referable to the Gross Takings of the respective businesses, and that it was not open to the Respondents to rely upon those representations, first, since, in respect of the Agreement for Sale of the Sydney businesses, those representations were superseded by the specific warranty contained in cl 16 of the Agreement for Sale of the Sydney businesses and, second, because each of the Agreements for Sale contained cl 3, to the effect that the relevant purchaser had not relied on any statement, representation or warranty, other than as specifically contained in the Contract.91 It seems to me that neither of those submissions should be accepted. As to the first, it seems to me that if, by reason of either fraudulent representation on behalf of Mr Quiambo, or of conduct, for which Mr Quiambo could be held liable, falling within s 42 of the Fair Trading Act 1987, Ecrovest was entitled to take proceedings against Mr Quiambo to recover any loss which it might have suffered, that right was not displaced by, but was additional to, any right which it might have had to bring proceedings against Mr Quiambo, to recover damages for breach of the warranty contained in Condition 16 of the Agreement for Sale of the Sydney businesses. So far as the second submission is concerned, it is, I believe, well established (see, for example S Pearson & Son Ltd v Lord Mayor &c of Dublin [1907] AC 351) that if, by reason of a fraudulent representation for which the other party to a contract is held to be liable, a party enters into a contract, the fact that that contract contains a clause such as cl 3 in each of the Agreements for Sale does not preclude the party so induced from rescinding the contract, or from bringing proceedings to obtain a decree of rescission, or to recover damages in respect of any loss which he has suffered by reason of his entry into the contract. So too, it seems to me to be well established (see, for example, Clark Equipment Australia Ltd v Covcat Pty Limited ((1987) 71 ALR 367); Henjo Investments Pty limited v Collins (Marrickville) Pty Ltd ((1988) 79 ALR 83) that where, as a result of conduct falling within s 42 of the Fair Trading Act 1987, for which conduct the other party to the contract is held liable, a party enters into a contract, the fact that the contract contains a provision, such as cl 3 in the several Agreements for Sale, does not preclude the party so induced from bringing proceedings against the other party to the contract, to obtain relief of the kind provided for by the Fair Trading Act 1987, in cases of a breach of s 42 of that Act. Although the authorities, to which I have earlier referred, would not, in law, have precluded Sidis DCJ from holding that the Appellants had not, in fact, relied upon the representations made by Mr Scarborough and Ms Fardouly, or the conduct on their part, for which Mr Scarborough, Mr Quiambo and Ms Quiambo were held liable, it is the fact, as I have earlier recorded, that the Appellants did rely on those representations and that conduct, which representations, in the case of Mr Scarborough, were made fraudulently.92 As I have earlier (para 87 (supra)) recorded, the next submission advanced on behalf of the Appellants, was that the Respondents had not established that the representations were, in fact, shown to have been false.93 Despite the Appellants’ bold assertion that the falsity of the representations was not, in fact, revealed by the evidence, it is my view that there was ample evidence available to Sidis DCJ, which permitted her to find, as she did, that the representations, which had been made prior to the Respondents’ entry into the Agreements for Sale, were in fact false, as also was there, in my view, abundant evidence available to her Honour which permitted her to find, as she did, that the representations which had been made by Mr Scarborough were false to his knowledge. It would be sufficient, in my view, to point to Mr Quiambo’s Income Tax Return for the Income Tax Years ended 30 June 1996 and 30 June 1997 to demonstrate that, in the first of such years, the Gross Sales and the Gross Margin of the Sydney carpet cleaning business, and in the second year the Gross Sales and the Gross Margin of each of the Sydney businesses, was significantly below that which had been represented. Further, it is sufficient to point to Mr Scarborough’s Income Tax Return for the Tax Year Ended 30 June 1997, in order to demonstrate that the Gross Sales and the Gross Margin of the Melbourne carpet cleaning business were significantly lower than had been represented. Ms Quiambo’s Income Tax Return for the Tax Year ended 30 June 1997 (Ex UU – see Black AB 496) although not reproduced in the Appeal papers, would seem likewise to demonstrate that the representations as to the Gross Sales and Income and the Gross Margin and the Weekly Net Profit were likewise significantly lower than had been represented. Thus, the Details of Business document represented the Gross Sales at $7,000-$9,000 per week, the Gross Margin at 70%, and the Weekly Net Profit, after provision had been made for Commissions, Expenses and Wages of $3,150. Despite this, Ms Quiambo’s Income Tax Return for that year disclosed a Total Business Income of $140,294 – a weekly income of $2,717 – and a Profit for the Year of $16,351 - $314 per week. But if more be thought necessary to support the view, which I have earlier recorded, it is to be found in the additional documents discovered by Mr Klich after Mr Scarborough had left the Sydney businesses at the end of March 1998, which additional materials, as they related to each of the two Sydney businesses, the Melbourne business and the Brisbane business, were dealt with by Sidis DCJ in the course of her judgment. 94 The principal bases for the Appellants’ attack on this aspect of her Honour’s judgment, are to be found in the following paragraphs of their Written Submissions (Orange AB 14): 
      
       
        
         
         “16.2 In the months following his acquisition of the Sydney businesses, Mr Klich deposed, they were generating cash profit, and, indeed, ‘generating profit in line with the representations in the Details of Business document’ (Ex A1 para 22). It is noteworthy that, not only did the trial Judge not refer to this evidence in her judgment, she concluded that the businesses ‘never ran at a profit and therefore must be assessed as worthless’ (RAB 55H). 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         ……………………………………………………………… 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         16.4 As at February 1998 the position was as described by Mr Klich in a critical passage (Black AB 102QW): 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         ‘Q. The businesses as you said on the reconciliation sheet are turning over $16,000 a week? 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         Q. What is the problem? 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         A. There is no problem. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         Q. There is no problem? 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         A. That’s right. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         Q. The problem in respect of the business in Sydney occurred later than the middle of February, did it? 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         A. Yes, that’s correct’.” 
         
        
       
     95 It should, however, be noted that what is asserted in para 16.2 of the Submissions, does not accurately record what was said by Mr Klich in his Affidavit, which was as follows (Blue AB 13-14): 
      
       
        
         
         “Following the purchase of the Sydney business in October 1997 (and apart from the usually quiet weeks of Christmas and New Year) the figures shown to me by Scarborough each week were very close to the figures promised to me. Scarborough continued to manage the business for me. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         During November and December 1997 I collected from Scarborough the cash ‘profit’ of the business each week. All of this money was put back into the business. At the end of each of those months I gave Scarborough $10,000 to pay to the vendor … 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         ………………………………………………………………. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         In mid November 1997 we purchased a vehicle for the Sydney pest control business. Another vehicle was purchased for the carpet cleaning business in January 1998. I understood the Sydney businesses to be generating profit in line with the representations in the Details of Business … and the representations referred to above, but that this profit was being used to make monthly payments under the vendor finance arrangement and for the purchase of the new vehicles”. 
         
        
       
     96 As I have been unable to identify the documents to which Counsel was apparently directing attention, at that part of the transcript which is referred to in para 16.4 of the Appellants’ Submissions, I am quite unable to know what weight should be given to the four questions and answers there recorded. In this regard it should be noted that the Respondents’ Submissions at trial contained the following (inter alia): 
      
       
        
         
         “In relation to DS para 37 ff it has never been part of the Plaintiffs’ case that the businesses performed other than in accordance with the Defendants’ representations as to turnover and profit prior to the settlement of the sale of the Melbourne and Brisbane businesses. It has always been the Plaintiffs’ contention that Mr Scarborough fraudulently created the appearance of profitability throughout that period and obtained, from whatever source, the cash necessary to make the weekly payments to Mr Klich consistent with the amount due pursuant to the Tuesday ‘square up’ spreadsheets. It may be inferred by the Court that some of the proceeds for the purchase price the (sic) Sydney businesses and the vendor finance payments made during the period were used for this purpose. Some corporation (sic) for this hypothesis is provided by the fact that the amount of $130,000 referred to in the bank statement (Exhibit MM cf T 430) was identified by Mr Scarborough as the proceeds of sale, and an amount that was loaned to him by Fernando Quiambo. $130,000 is $20,000 less than the amount paid on settlement on 1 November 1997. It needs hardly to be stated that if Mr Scarborough had not engineered such a situation the sale of Melbourne and Brisbane would have been jeopardised. It is significant, that Mr Klich gave evidence on several occasions that the decline in turnover and profit began in a marked fashion immediately after the settlement of the sale of the Melbourne and Brisbane businesses on 16 February 1998”. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       (Ex MM comprised Bank Statements relating to an Account No. 10138729 in the name of AAA Abest Cleaning, with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, to which Account, so it would seem, Mr Scarborough and Ms Quiambo were authorised signatories. It was into that Account that the cheque for $130,000, said to have represented part of the sale of the proceeds of the Sydney business, was paid.) 
       
     97 Although, in the course of her judgment, Sidis DCJ did not deal expressly with the matters to which Counsel for the Plaintiffs at trial referred in the extract from the Written Submissions which I have just set out, it is not without point to note that, in the course of her judgment, when dealing with the question of the “standard of proof”, her Honour wrote (RAB 49): 
      
       
        
         
         “It was argued that the takings were never as great as represented but that Mr Scarborough in the course of a deliberate fraud had created the impression of takings greater than were in fact received for the purpose of inducing Mr Klich and Dr Adams to proceed with the purchase of the Melbourne and Brisbane businesses”. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
        
       Given that this was so, her Honour’s finding that the claim in fraud against Mr Scarborough had been proved, would seem to indicate that her Honour had accepted the validity of that submission. 
       
     98 As I have earlier (see para 87 (above)) recorded, the next attack upon Sidis DCJ’s judgment was that the representations were not shown to be causative of any loss suffered by the Respondents.99 To this attack, so it seems to me, there are two answers, they being: 
      
       
       (1) The evidence of Mr Klich, which was accepted by her Honour, was that he would not have been a party to Ecrovest, Abala or Abaca entering into the relevant Agreements for Sale in the absence of the representations which, as her Honour held, were shown to have been false; and 
       
      
      
       
       (2) As I earlier indicated, the evidence of Mr Quiambo’s Income Tax Returns for the Taxation Year Ended 30 June 1997, indicated that the Gross Sales of the Sydney carpet cleaning business were substantially less than had been represented, and that business operated at a loss while the Gross Sales of the pest service business were significantly below what had been represented, and that business was at best marginal; the evidence of Ms Quiambo’s Income Tax Return for the same taxation year would indicate that the Gross Sales of that business were significantly lower than what had been represented as also was the Net Profit, which was, at best, modest in the extreme; while Mr Scarborough’s Income Tax Returns for the same year would indicate that the Gross Sales of the Melbourne business were almost non-existent, and the business operated at what, compared to the sales, was a significant loss. 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         The net result thus was that, as a result of their relying upon the representations, Ecrovest, Abaca and Abala entered into Agreements for Sale in respect of businesses, the result of which fell far short of those which had been represented, and in doing so, both expended significant sums of money and committed themselves to pay further significant sums of money. 
         
        
       
     100 Although the attack made on Sidis DCJ’s finding that the claims under s 42 of the Fair Trading Act 1987 had been made out did not come next in the attacks which were made on her Honour’s judgment, the matters to which I have referred both, in my view, demonstrate that that attack has not been made out. 101 I turn next to the submission – which was not elaborated upon in any detail – that the Respondents’ claims in contract ought to have been dismissed.102 Although, in the course of her judgment, Sidis DCJ did deal specifically with the Respondents’ claim that there had been a breach of the warranty contained in cl 16 of the Agreement for Sale of the Sydney businesses, she did not deal in any detail with the claim based upon what was said to have been a breach of the warranty contained in cl 3 of each of the Agreements for Sale. However, it seems to me, that it is implicit in her Honour’s conclusions that she found that, in each case, there had been a breach of that warranty, which warranty related to “the fee base” of the business which was said to have been correct as at the date of the relevant Agreement for Sale. It seems to me that “the fee base” of the relevant business was the Gross Sales of that business, calculated on an annual basis. If this be so, then it would follow from the findings made by Sidis DCJ in respect of each of the Agreements for Sale, that the fee base of each of the businesses, the subject of the relevant Agreement for Sale, was other than had been represented, it following that there had been a breach of warranty in each case.103 The next attack upon Sidis DCJ’s judgment was that her Honour’s treatment of the question of damages was erroneous, a submission that was put in two differing ways: 
      
       
       (1) That the evidence, so it was submitted, dictated the conclusion that the Plaintiffs had failed to prove any loss arising from their acquisition of any of the businesses, the subject of the three Agreements for Sale as, so it was submitted, at the time of the acquisition of each business, it was trading successfully and thereafter it continued to trade successfully; 
       
      
      
       
       (2) In relation to each of the Brisbane and Melbourne businesses, the evidence which was tendered to establish damages suffered by Abaca and Abala, was of such quality that it ought not to have been relied upon as establishing damage. 
       
     104 So far as the first of these matters is concerned, what I have earlier written, in my view, is sufficient to demonstrate that it was open to Sidis DCJ to conclude that the Sydney businesses did not, after their acquisition by Ecrovest, generate profits which were, in fact, consistent with the representations which had been made, notwithstanding that, between 1 November 1997 and 1 April 1998 the businesses continued under the management of Mr Scarborough. 
      
       
       Further, it is to be noted that the few original business records relating to the Brisbane and Melbourne businesses, which were located by Mr Klich, relating to the periods prior to the giving of the Details of Business documents to Mr Klich, related to isolated weeks, and not to the whole period, it following that while those records were sufficient to demonstrate the falsity of the figures contained in the Details of Business documents, they did not permit a calculation across the whole period, it following that her Honour was correct when she said, in the course of her judgment, (RAB 55): 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         “The extent of the overstatement cannot be calculated because there are no records of the true takings and expenses of the businesses”. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       In addition, there was the evidence of Mr Klich, that almost from the time of the acquisition of the Brisbane and Melbourne businesses, the figures which he was given as to the takings progressively declined below those which had been given in the Details of Business documents. 
       
     105 The evidence which had been tendered to establish the trading losses which were suffered by Abaca and Abala for the period to 30 June 1998 were Financial Statements, which had been prepared by an accountant, Mr Gulczinski. In their written submissions (Orange AB 17), the Appellants asserted that “the accounts were prepared from weekly summary sheets provided by Mr Klich … , the accuracy of which the accountant doubted”; in many cases these “didn’t add up”, and were “inaccurate”, a reference being given to the Accountant’s evidence at Black AB 407E, 408H. However, a reading of Mr Gulczinski’s evidence at those pages makes it abundantly clear that his comments were made, not in relation to the materials given to him by Mr Klich in relation to the Brisbane and Melbourne businesses, but in relation to Weekly Summary Sheets which had been prepared by Mr Scarborough in relation to the Sydney businesses, and while he was Manager. There is, in my view, no substance in this submission. 
      
       
       Even if there had been some substance in the submission however, it would, in my view, still have been open to Sidis DCJ to have regard to those Financial Statements when dealing with the question of damages. That this was so is, in my view, indicated by the following passage in the judgment of Handley JA, with whom Mason P and Beazley JA agreed, in  
       Houghton v Immer [No 155] Pty Ltd  
       ((1997) 44 NSWLR 46, 59): 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         “The defendants, having improved common property without lawful authority, and attempted to effect a fraud on the minority, are wrongdoers, and their failure to keep and produce proper accounts of their actual expenditure on the common property has made it difficult to assess the compensation due to the plaintiff; compare  
         Armory v Delamirie  
         (1722) 1 Stra 505; 93 ER 664. In my judgment the Court should assess the compensation in a robust manner, relying on the presumption against wrongdoers, the onus of proof, and resolving doubtful question against the party ‘whose actions have made an accurate determination so problematic’; see  
         LJP Investments Pty Ltd v Howard Chia Investments Pty Ltd 
          (1990) 24 NSWLR 499 at 508”. 
         
        
       
     106 Although, in their Notice of Appeal, the Appellants (Ground 7) asserted error on the part of Sidis DCJ in calculating the amount of the quantum of damages, and (Ground 10) asserted that her Honur erred in dismissing the Appellants’ Cross-Claims, in their Written Submissions, the Appellants addressed no submission to either of those Grounds of Appeal, the only submission directed to the quantum of damages being directed to the question of interest on a compound basis (Ground 10). 
      
       
       This notwithstanding, it seems appropriate to observe, first, that it seems to be accepted ( 
       Vadasz v Pioneer Concrete (SA) Pty Limited  
       (1995) 184 CLR 102;  
       Akron Securities v Iliffe (1997)  
       41 NSWLR 353;  
       Esanda Finance Corporation Limited v Tong  
       (1997) 41 NSWLR 482), that there is no single remedy which will always be appropriate in cases, such as this was, where relief is claimed, pursuant to such provisions as s 52 of the  
       Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth),  
       or s 42 of the 
        Fair Trading Act 1987;  
       and, second, that where, in such a case, an award of damages is thought to be appropriate, there is no one correct method or formula for determining a quantum of damages  
       (Marks 
        v 
        GIO Australia Holdings Limited  
       (1998) 73 ALJR 12, 20-21 per McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ; see also  
       Collings Construction Co Pty Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission  
       (1998) 152 ALR 510, 522). 
       
      
      
       
       The form of the orders proposed by Sidis DCJ in her principal judgment would tend to indicate that her Honour thought that the appropriate remedy to be made available to the Respondents was, first, an award of damages for such sums of money as they had actually lost as the result of entering into several Agreements for Sale, together with an order relieving them of the obligation to make further payments pursuant to the vendor finance provisions in each of the Agreements for Sale and, in the case of Mr Klich, the guarantee given by him when the vendor finance provisions were varied. 
       
     107 Although, in her principal judgment, Sidis DCJ (RAB 56) indicated that the damages to be allowed would be the amounts shown in each of the Agreements of Sale for goodwill, together with the amounts claimed for trading losses to the end of June 1998, together with interest on those sums on a compounding basis, and although, in her supplementary judgment (Orange AB 46), her Honour did deal with the question of the Court’s power to allow interest on a compound basis, it may be doubted whether the amounts finally awarded to each of Ecrovest, Abaca and Abala were calculated in accordance with the “formula” set out by her Honour in her principal judgment.108 In her supplementary judgment, Sidis DCJ wrote (inter alia) (Orange AB 45): 
      
       
        
         
         “1. In this matter my reasons were issued on 17 March 2000. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         2. The proceedings were then stood over to 23 March 2000 to deal with issues of interest and costs. The proceedings were further stood over to 13 April to finalise the orders after further written submissions. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         3. On 13 April 2000 I gave certain indications as to the manner in which the plaintiffs’ damages were to be calculated and I ruled on issues concerning costs and the defendants’ request for a stay of proceedings. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         The proceedings were further stood over to allow the parties to agree upon calculations of the quantum of damages to be awarded to the third, fourth and fifth plaintiffs so that final orders could be made in chambers. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         4. The defendants did not accept the plaintiffs’ initial calculations for the reasons set out in the letter of the defendants’ solicitors dated 26 April 2000 addressed to my Associate. This letter did not attempt to re-calculate damages on the basis propounded by the defendants.  
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         5. The plaintiffs, although not agreeing to the defendants’ propositions, recalculated damages on the basis put forward by the defendants as set out in a letter to the defendants’ solicitors dated 19 May 2000. I asked the defendants to respond to these calculations by 4 pm on 24 May 2000, failing which I would proceed to make final orders in Chambers. No response was received by the time stipulated and none has been received to the date of the final orders which I now propose to make”. 
         
        
       
     109 If the “formula” proposed by Sidis DCJ in her principal judgment had been adopted, the sums to be awarded by way of damages would have been: 
      
       
       (1) In the case of Ecrovest, $172,367 (Goodwill $136,336 plus Trading Losses to 30/6/98 $36,031) plus compound interest; 
       
      
      
       
       (2) Abaca $118,106 (Goodwill $102,312 plus Trading Losses to 30/6/98 $15,794) plus compound interest; 
       
      
      
       
       (3) Abala $45,929.12 (Goodwill $38,643 plus Trading Losses to 30/6/98 $7,286.12) plus compound interest. 
       
      
      
       
       These figures are to be contrasted with the respective amounts of damages awarded by Sidis DCJ which awards, said to include compound interest, were, as I have earlier (see para 81 (above)) noted, were as follows: 
       
      
      
       
       (4) Ecrovest $177,867.72;  
       
      
      
       
       (5) Abaca $83,535.82; 
       
      
      
       
       (6) Abala $23,392.58. 
       
      
      
       
       Since the Appellants, although apparently in a position to do so, have not favoured us with any indication of how those three amounts were, or might have been, calculated, it is quite impossible to know what part of each amount represents compound interest. 
       
     110 That, notwithstanding such provisions as s 83A (2)(a) of the District Court Act 1973, it is open to a court, in an appropriate case, to allow damages by way of compound interest upon expenses incurred, or costs arising, (Hungerfords v Walker ((1998-1999) 171 CLR 125); Bushwall Properties Limited v Vortex Properties Limited ([1975] 1 WLR 1649)), it does not seem to me that the present was such an appropriate case. In Hungerfords v Walker ((supra) at 149-150), Mason CJ and Wilson J, after referring to the reluctance of the Common Law to adopt the Admiralty approach in awarding compensation for late payment of damages in the general run of cases, said: 
      
       
        
         
         “But we see no reason for allowing the reluctance of the common law to extend the cases where the defendant’s breach of contract or negligence has caused the plaintiff to pay away or the defendant to withhold money and, as a result, the plaintiff has been deprived of the use of the money so paid away or withheld. The recovery of compensation for the loss may be ascribed to the operation of the second limb in  
         Hadley v Baxendale 
         . However, we prefer to put it on the footing that it is a foreseeable loss, necessarily within the contemplation of the parties, which is directly related to the defendant’s breach of contract or tort.  
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         On this footing the Full Court was correct in awarding damages for the added costs of funding the business with borrowed money as a result of the loss of the use of money overpaid in tax. The award of interest was of necessity compound interest. Simple interest would not reflect accurately the extent of the respondents’ loss. Simple interest almost always undercompensates the injured party’s true loss. Bowles and Whelan, ‘Judgments, Awards and Simple Interest Rates’, International Review of Law and Economics, vol 1, (1981) 111, at p 112 observe: 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
          
           
           ‘If the plaintiff was expecting payment for a consignment of goods, but did not receive his money, the extent of his loss could be measured approximately by the amount of income that he could otherwise have generated simply by putting the proceeds into a deposit account at a bank. Such a move would attract compound interest, since the bank would automatically add to the account any interest generated. Equally a plaintiff in a tort action can be thought of incurring opportunity costs best measured by compound rather than simple rates. Had he received his award immediately upon the damage occurring, it may be assumed that he would have invested it at compound rates in just the same way as would the plaintiff who is suffering from the breach of contract’. 
           
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         The disdain of the common law for interest, especially compound interest, is a ‘relic from the days when interest was regarded as necessarily usurious’ (Ogus ‘Law of Damages’ (1973), p 98)”. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       In a separate judgment, Brennan and Deane JJ, wrote ((supra) at 152): 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         “… there is no acceptable reason why the ordinary principles governing the recovery of common law damages should not, in an appropriate case, apply to entitle a plaintiff to an actual award of damages as compensation for a wrongfully and foreseeably caused loss of the use of money. To the extent that the recorded cases support the proposition that damages cannot be awarded as compensation for the loss of the use of a specific sum of money which the wrongful act of the defendant has caused to be paid away or withheld, they are contrary to principle and commercial reality and should not be followed”. 
         
        
       
     111 If, for the moment, one leaves to one side the question of interest, the amount of damages which Sidis DCJ proposed to award to each of Ecrovest, Abaca and Abala was the amount of the direct financial loss which her Honour considered that each had suffered as the result of entering into the relevant Agreement for Sale, such losses being the foreseeable consequence of the conduct on the part of the Appellants of which the Respondent’s complained. However, there does not appear to have been any evidence of any additional cost incurred, or loss suffered, by any of Ecrovest, Abaca or Abala which would have brought the case within the principle discussed in Hungerfords v. Walker (supra). This being so, while an award of simple interest on the several amounts of damages proposed for some period prior to Judgment could legitimately have been awarded, an award of compound interest would not seem to have been open.112 I therefore conclude that, to the extent, if at all, to which the awards of damages include compound interest, but not otherwise, the Appeal should be upheld.113 The final attack made by the Appellants upon Sidis DCJ’s judgment is that her Honour erred in making an award for indemnity costs.114 I do not agree with that submission. It seems to me that there were two aspects of the present case which justified the award made by her Honour as I have earlier (see para 53 (above)) recorded. In her judgment Sidis DCJ wrote (RAB 38): 
      
       
        
         
         “Overall I have reached the conclusion that I can place no reliance on the evidence of the defendants and their witnesses. Their evidence left me with no doubt that there had been a conscious effort on the part of the defendants and their witnesses to deceive the Court as to the real facts surrounding the sales of businesses”. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       Further, it is to be noted that the accusations made against Mr Klich (see RAB 29) – that he wished to deceive his wife and Dr Adams, that he was a womaniser – against Dr Adams (see RAB 30) – that he, too, was a womaniser, and that his interest in the business was directed at tax avoidance – against Mr Pearce (see RAB 30) that he was involved in tax avoidance, and in the deceit of the Child Support Agency – and against Mr Daniel (see RAB 30) – that he, too, was involved in tax avoidance, and Social Security fraud – all of which allegations were clearly intended to affect the credibility of the Respondents and their witnesses, all of which allegations required evidence to be led to meet them, and all of which allegations must be taken to have been rejected by Sidis DCJ, could not be regarded as anything but scandalous and deliberately indulged in an attempt to avoid liability on the part of the Appellants (see  
       Degmam Pty Ltd (In Liq) v Wright (No 2)  
       [1983] 2 NSWLR 354). 
       
     115 I turn then, but only briefly, to the Cross-Appeal.116 Although, in their Notice of Appeal, the Respondents charged that Sidis DCJ erred in dismissing the claims of Mr Klich and Dr Adams, and the order that they pay and bear their own costs of those claims, and seek an order that Orders 5 and 6 made by her Honour be set aside, they do not seek any order for substantive relief in favour of Mr Klich and Dr Adams in respect of their claims, but seek only an order that the Appellants pay their costs of the trial.117 I do not agree that Sidis DCJ erred in dismissing the claims made by Mr Klich and Dr Adams. In Gould v Vaggelas ((1983-1985) 157 CLR 215) Gibbs CJ said ((supra) at 219-220): 
      
       
        
         
         “The second question, whether the Goulds have established that they suffered damage because they acted in reliance on the false statements made by Vaggelas and, if so, what is the measure of their damage, is a more difficult one. The difficulty lies not in stating the legal principles which should be applied, but in applying those principles to the facts of the case. It is clear that it was not right to identify the Goulds with the company, Gould Holdings Pty Ltd ‘Gould Holdings’ , which the Goulds formed to make the purchase, notwithstanding that they were the sole shareholders. It is of course elementary to say, as was said in  
         Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v Newman Industries Ltd [No 2], 
          ‘that A cannot, as a general rule, bring an action against B to recover damages or secure other relief on behalf of C for an injury done by B to C. C is the proper plaintiff because C is the party injured, and therefore the person in whom the cause of action is vested’. Any loss suffered by Gould Holdings as a consequence of the fraud can be recovered only by the company itself. Even if the company had not commenced an action within the limitation period, its failure to enforce its own rights would not have enhanced the rights of the Goulds, see  
         Prudential Assurance v Newman Industries [No 2] 
         . However, although the Goulds cannot recover damages merely because Gould Holdings has suffered damage, and cannot recover damages which are merely a reflection of the loss suffered by the company, they may recover damages for the loss which they personally have suffered and which is separate and distinct from the loss suffered by the company. That this is so is clear in principle, but if authority is needed, the judgment in  
         Prudential Assurance v Newman Industries 
          provides it”. 
         
        
       
     118 The passage of the judgment in the Court of Appeal in Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v Newman Industries Ltd {No 2}, to which in his judgment Gibbs CJ referred, was as follows ([1982] 1 Ch 204, 222-223): 
      
       
        
         
         “In our judgment the personal claim is misconceived. It is of course correct, as the judge found and Mr Bartlett did not dispute, that he and Mr Laughton, in advising the shareholders to support the resolution approving the agreement, owed the shareholders a duty to give such advice in good faith and not fraudulently. It is also correct that if directors convene a meeting on the basis of a fraudulent circular, a shareholder will have a right of action to recover any loss which he has been personally caused in consequence of the fraudulent circular; this might include the expense of attending the meeting. But what he cannot do is to recover damages merely because the company in which he is interested has suffered damage. He cannot recover a sum equal to the diminution in the market value of the shares, or equal to the likely diminution in dividend, because such a ‘loss’ is merely a reflection of the loss suffered by the company. The shareholder does not suffer any personal loss. His only ‘loss’ is through the company, in the diminution in the value of the net assets of the company, in which he has (say) a 3 percent shareholding. The plaintiff ’s shares are merely a right of participation in the company on the terms of the articles of association. The shares themselves, his right of participation, are not directly affected by the wrongdoing. The plaintiff still holds all the shares as his own absolutely unencumbered property. The deceit practised upon the plaintiff does not affect the shares; it merely enables the defendant to rob the company”. 
         
        
       
     119 In the present case, as it seems to me, Mr Klich and Dr Adams failed to demonstrate that they had sustained a loss which was separate and distinct from the loss suffered by the companies in which they were interested.120 This being so, it would follow that Mr Klich and Dr Adams were not entitled to an order in their favour for the costs of their personal claims.121 Finally, the Respondents alleged that Sidis DCJ erred in failing to make orders pursuant to s 72 of the Fair Trading Act 1987 and s 135 of the District Court Act 1973, declaring void or varying the Agreements for Sale involving Abaca and Abala, and consequently erred in determining the quantum of damages payable to those two Respondents.122 As I have previously (see para 106 (above)) recorded, there is no single remedy which is always appropriate in which claims for relief, pursuant to the provisions of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), or s 42 of the Fair Trading Act 1987 is sought, and that there is no one correct method or formula for determining damage in cases in which an award of damages is thought appropriate. This being so, it is clear that, in determining what is the appropriate remedy in such a case, a trial Judge is exercising a judicial discretion, the exercise of which discretion may only be successfully challenged upon the grounds set out in the well known passage in the joint judgment of Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan in House v The King ((1936) 55 CLR 499, 504-505). In my opinion, the Respondents have failed to make out any case of relevant error on the part of Sidis DCJ.123 In my opinion, except to the extent to which I have earlier indicated, (see para 112 (above)), the Appeal should be dismissed, the Appellants to pay the Respondents’ costs of the Appeal, and the Cross-Appeal should be dismissed, but that there should be no Order as to the costs of the Cross-Appeal. The Appellants and the Respondents should be required to bring in Minutes of an Order as to the amount of damages to be substituted for those awarded by Sidis DCJ in the event that those awarded include compound interest and, in the event that they are unable to agree, should be required to file Written Submissions in support of the figures which each side has advanced, the form of the award to be made in each case, in the event of disagreement between the parties to be determined on the Written Submissions.124 STUDDERT AJA: I agree with Powell JA.

     1 SHELLER JA: I agree with Kirby J. 
      
       
     2 DOWD J: I agree with the proposed orders and reasons therefor in the draft judgment of Kirby J. 
      
       
     3 KIRBY J: Raymond Peter Anderson (the appellant) was charged with having been knowingly concerned (between 29 November 1996 and 25 December 1996) in the importation of a prohibited import, cocaine, in not less than a commercial quantity (s233B(1)(d) Customs Act, 1901). Mr Anderson was convicted on 17 November 1999 after a trial before his Honour Judge Sides and a jury. 
      
       
        
       The Crown Case 
       
     4 On 29 November 1996 Mr Anderson and Mr Stan Hokafonu attended a travel agency at Bondi. They enquired about the purchase of four airline tickets to Los Angeles. Mr Viliama (Jimmy) Hokafonu and Mr Harry Sitorios would also be travelling. The agency made enquiries. Only three seats were available, although there was the prospect of a fourth seat. A booking was made in the name of Mr Anderson. On 3 December 1996 the agency telephoned Mr Stan Hokafonu and confirmed the seat of Mr Sitorios. Hotel accommodation for the group was also booked. Mr Stan Hokafonu paid the agency in cash. The cost of each airfare and hotel package was approximately $1,500. Mr Anderson said that he borrowed $3,000 from a friend and paid Mr Stan Hokafonu $1,500. The remainder was spending money. 
      
       
     5 On 6 December 1996 the group left Australia. They were scheduled to return on 16 December 1996. However, they extended their stay. They returned on 25 December 1996, on board United Airlines Flight UA.815 from Los Angeles to Sydney. 
      
       
     6 Customs Officers searched the aircraft upon its arrival in Sydney. Two garbage receptacles at the rear of the aircraft were found to contain 20 packages of white powder. The packages weighed almost 10 kilograms. Upon analysis they were found to contain 7.5 kilograms of cocaine. The Crown alleged that others were to collect the drugs from the garbage receptacles once the aircraft had reached Sydney. 
      
       
     7 Each of the 20 packages consisted of an inner and outer plastic bag. The inner bag contained the cocaine. It was placed inside a second plastic bag containing what appeared to be coffee beans. Each package had grey silver ducting tape adhering to it. Four pieces of that tape were found to have human hairs trapped in the adhesive. On one tape the hairs were mid brown in colour and identified as Caucasian body hair. They were subjected to DNA analysis, and were found to match the profile of Mr Anderson, such that he could not be excluded as the source. The remaining hairs, however, were not Caucasian. They were consistent with the body hair of a person of Tongan extraction. Mr Anderson was therefore excluded as the source. Messrs Stan and Viliama Hokafonu and Mr Harry Sitorios were of Tongan extraction. 
      
       
     8 The Crown invited the inference that Mr Anderson and his three Tongan companions had strapped cocaine to their bodies before boarding the aircraft. The packages had been removed once they were on the aeroplane, and had been placed in the garbage receptacles. 
      
       
     9 Mr Anderson’s fingerprints were also found on the adhesive tape attached to one of the packages. When the package was recovered, the tape was adhering to the outer plastic bag. It was necessary to freeze the package at minus 80oC to remove the tape. At that temperature the adhesive glue froze and the tape could be plucked off. Once removed, the fingerprints of the right index finger and the left index finger of Mr Anderson were uncovered. They were on the adhesive side of the tape, that is, the side that had been stuck to the bag. No fingerprints were found on the non-adhesive side of the tape, nor on the bag itself. Three rubber gloves were found in the aircraft, two in the toilet, and one near a seat occupied by one of the group. 
      
       
        
       The Case for the Appellant 
       
     10 The appellant gave evidence. He was a man aged 49 years at the time of the trial. He had known his travelling companions for some 12 years or more. In August 1996 his mother became ill. He ceased work as a salesman in order to care for her. Her condition deteriorated through medical misadventure. She died in late August. His sadness was made the worse by the death, in early November 1996, of the daughter of his partner. One gathers that she died of a drug overdose. To dull the pain, Mr Anderson said that he drank to excess. 
      
       
     11 Mr Stan Hokafonu was a friend. He recognised Mr Anderson’s problem and sought to help. He repeatedly asked him to come to Los Angeles in early December. At first Mr Anderson resisted. However, eventually he agreed to go. 
      
       
     12 Mr Anderson said that once overseas his companions went off together from time to time, leaving him alone. He thought nothing of it, since they had relatives to visit, and business to transact. The business was connected with a hotel in which they had an interest. 
      
       
     13 On Christmas Day 1996, the four boarded the aircraft at Los Angeles. Mr Anderson sat beside the youngest member of the group, Mr Harry Sitorios, aged 17 years. He said that he knew nothing of the drugs carried on board. The lights of the aircraft were dimmed during the course of the flight. Mr Sitorios had temporarily vacated his seat. Mr Anderson reached under Mr Sitorios’s seat for a blanket. There was a Duty Free bag on top of the blanket. Mr Anderson said that he reached into the bag and removed its contents. He did so with both hands. He felt adhesive tape. It was loose inside the bag. It caught his arm, removing hairs as he withdrew his hand. He immediately suspected that the packages inside the bag were drugs. He said that he was horrified. He went to the toilet to examine the bag more closely. His suspicions were confirmed. It was obvious that the package contained drugs. He therefore took the package to Mr Stan Hokafonu. Mr Hokafonu said that he would deal with it. He assured Mr Anderson that he would dispose of the drugs. 
      
       
        
       The Notice of Appeal 
       
     14 The appellant relies upon two grounds of appeal, as follows: 
      
       
       
       1. The directions given by the learned trial Judge on the onus and standard of proof in relation to the account given by the accused were erroneous and inadequate. 
        
        
       2. The verdict of the jury is unreasonable having regard to the evidence. 
        
       
     15 I will deal with each ground in turn. 
      
       
        
       Ground 1: The Directions on Onus and Standard of Proof 
       
     16 His Honour gave conventional directions concerning the onus and standard of proof. The appellant, in written submissions, acknowledged that his Honour’s directions were “entirely unobjectionable”. However, his Honour added the following words, including the words underlined, about which complaint is made: 
      
       
        
         
         “Suspicion and speculation do not amount to proof beyond reasonable doubt.  
         The words ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ are ordinary English words and for obvious reasons they involve a very high standard of proof 
         . You are only permitted to find the accused guilty if you are satisfied to that very high standard, that is beyond reasonable doubt, that each and every element of he offence has been made out.” 
         
        
       
     17 It was submitted by the appellant that it was misleading to describe the words “beyond reasonable doubt” as ordinary English words, and “to presume that their meaning is obvious”. Attention was drawn to recent Canadian authority, which appeared to accept the need to explain and define what is meant by that term (R v Lifchus 1997 118 CCC (3d) at 6; R v Starr 2000 147 CCC (3d) at 15). These authorities relied upon a decision of the US Supreme Court where it was held that the expression “beyond reasonable doubt” should be defined (Victor v Nebraska  127 L Ed 2d 583 (1994)). In that case, Ginsberg J, in a separate concurring opinion, said this: (at 603) 
      
       
        
         
         “Because the trial judges in fact defined reasonable doubt in both jury charges we review, we need not decide whether the Constitution required them to do so. Whether or not the Constitution so requires, however, the argument for defining the concept is strong. While judges and lawyers are familiar with the reasonable doubt standard, the words ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’ are not self-defining for jurors. Several studies of jury behaviour have concluded that ‘jurors are often confused about the meaning of reasonable doubt’, when that term is left undefined ... Thus, even if definitions of reasonable doubt are necessarily imperfect, the alternative -- refusing to define the concept at all -- is not obviously preferable.” 
         
        
       
     18 However, the position in Australia is quite different. The expression “beyond reasonable doubt” was described by Barton ACJ in Brown v The King (1913) 17 CLR 570 at 584 as a term “in ordinary and common use”. In Dawson v The Queen (1961) 106 CLR 1, Dixon CJ said this: (at 18) 
      
       
        
         
         “... it is a mistake to depart from the time-honoured formula. It is, I think, used by ordinary people and is understood well enough by the average man in the community. The attempts to substitute other expressions, of which there have been many examples not only here but in England, have never prospered. It is wise as well as proper to avoid such expressions.” 
         
        
       
     19 That approach was adopted by Barwick CJ, McTiernan and Owen JJ in Green v The Queen (1971) 126 CLR 28. Nothing said by his Honour Sides DCJ was, in my view, misleading or erroneous. 
      
       
     20 Having retired to consider its verdict, the jury returned with a question. To understand the question, it is necessary to refer to written directions provided to the jury, identifying the elements of the charge, namely: 
      
       
        
         
         1. That the accused knew that the goods were cocaine or some illegal drug. 
         
        
        
         
         2. That the accused was concerned in the importation. 
         
        
        
         
         3. That there was an importation into Australia. 
         
        
        
         
         4. What was imported was a prohibited import, namely cocaine. 
         
        
       
     21 There was, as his Honour said in the summing up, no dispute in respect of elements 3 and 4. The issue was whether the accused stumbled across a crime being committed by one or more of his companions, or whether he was involved in that crime. In that context the jury asked the following question: 
      
       
        
         
         “We, the jury, request to be provided with a copy of your final summary in relation to the absolute definitions of the elements one and two in the annexure.” 
         
        
       
     22 His Honour repeated the directions which had been given in respect of those issues. The appellant acknowledges that such directions were “unobjectionable”. Having completed those directions, his Honour invited comment from counsel. Counsel then appearing for the appellant said this: 
      
       
        
         
         “If your Honour will also add the rider that in relation to the first part, element one, if the jury was satisfied, because the accused’s evidence was true, that they would not find, based on what he said that he had the relevant knowledge” 
         
        
       
     23 The question was obscure. It was a question characterised by the appellant in written submissions as “not likely to assist the jury, or for that matter the appellant ...”. There followed an exchange between his Honour and counsel in these words: 
      
       
        
         
         “His Honour: Yes, well I think that follows from what I have said. If you were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s account was a truthful one then you could not find either element one or two to have been made out. 
         
        
        
         
         Somosi: Sorry, your Honour. I think with respect, the jury don’t need to be satisfied of the accused’s account beyond reasonable doubt. 
         
        
        
         
         His Honour: Did I say that? 
         
        
        
         
         Somosi: Your Honour did say that. 
         
        
        
         
         His Honour: I am sorry. What I meant is, if you were satisfied that the accused’s account were true. That was a slip of the tongue. I remind you the accused does not have to prove or disprove anything. It is for the Crown to prove each of the elements including these two beyond reasonable (doubt). Thank you, Mr Somosi. Would you now continue your deliberations please.” 
         
        
       
     24 Counsel for the appellant described the exchange as “unfortunate”. It was an error made at a critical time. The written submissions for the appellant included the following: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is submitted that the essential effect of what was said was to leave the jury with a misapprehension regarding the burden and standard of proof.” 
         
        
       
     25 Counsel for the appellant drew attention to a decision of the Canadian Supreme Court, R v W(D) [1991] 1 SCR 742, where Cory J formulated what have apparently since become standard directions in Canadian criminal trials. His Honour said this: (at 757/8) 
      
       
        
         
         “Ideally, appropriate instructions on the issue of credibility should be given, not only during the main charge, but on any recharge. A trial judge might well instruct the jury on the question of credibility along these lines: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘First, if you believe the evidence of the accused, obviously you must acquit. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Second, if you do not believe the testimony of the accused but you are left in reasonable doubt by it, you must acquit. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Third, even if you are not left in doubt by the evidence of the accused, you must ask yourself whether, on the basis of the evidence which you do accept, you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt by that evidence of the guilt of the accused.’” 
           
          
         
        
       
     26 Directions along these lines are customarily given, although I prefer the following formulation: 
      
       
        
         
         “First, if you believe the evidence of the accused, obviously you must acquit. 
         
        
        
         
         Second, if you find difficulty in accepting the evidence of the accused, but think that it might be true, then you must acquit. 
         
        
        
         
         Third, if you do not believe the accused, then you should put his testimony to one side. The question will remain; has the Crown, upon the basis of evidence that you do accept, proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt?” 
         
        
       
     27 Counsel’s request to his Honour was presumably directed to the first of these issues. His Honour’s answer initially included, inappropriately, the words “satisfied beyond reasonable doubt”. That was then corrected. Incorporating that correction, the jury was told that if they were satisfied that the accused’s account were true, then they would not find elements 1 or 2 had been made out. That was the direction sought by counsel for Mr Anderson. Having made the error, his Honour wisely added a reminder of his previous directions on the onus and standard of proof. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I remind you the accused does not have to prove or disprove anything. It is for the Crown to prove each of the elements including these two beyond reasonable (doubt).” 
         
        
       
     28 In these circumstances, I cannot accept that the jury would have been under any misapprehension as to the burden or standard of proof. Moreover, his Honour had, moments before, in the directions responding to the jury’s question, said the following: 
      
       
        
         
         “And I remind you, in relation to each of these elements, the Crown relies upon a circumstantial case in the absence of direct evidence, to make out its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and I remind you that you could not find these elements, or either of them made out, unless you were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the element had been made out and that you could exclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, the possibility that the accused came across the drugs in an innocent fashion as he described in his evidence.” 
         
        
       
     29 I would, therefore, reject the first ground of appeal. 
      
       
        
       Ground 2: The Jury Verdict was Unreasonable 
       
     30 His Honour identified for the jury the circumstances relied upon by the Crown in these words: 
      
       
        
         
         “1. The accused going to the US with the three companions, Stan and Jimmy Hokafanua (sic) and Harry Sitorios, and that they left on 12 December; 
          (sic 6 December) 
         
        
        
         
         2. The accused returning from the US with the same three individuals arriving here on Christmas day and that that return journey was some considerable days after what was originally planned; 
         
        
        
         
         3. The accused’s general association with the other three men who I’ve named and who have been referred to as the Tongan men; 
         
        
        
         
         4. The finding of the twenty packets of powder containing 7.5 kilograms of cocaine in the two bins in the rear galley of the aeroplane that had conveyed the accused and the three other men from the US to Australia; 
         
        
        
         
         5. The fingerprints of the accused found on the tape, exhibit P, that had been on exhibit O, the plastic bag which was an outer bag that was item 1/14a shown in exhibit N41; and 
         
        
        
         
         6. The final circumstance is the body hair that could have come from the accused in the sense that he was not excluded as being the source of it, that was on the tape, that was on a bag and was number item 1/5b that is depicted in exhibit N, photographs 19 and, I think, 49. In combination with Dr Robinson’s evidence that it was hair from a Caucasian and not from an islander.” 
         
        
       
     31 The appellant pointed to a number of suggested defects in the proof offered by the Crown. First, the Federal Police Officer who gave evidence of hair adhering to the adhesive tape was “distinctly unconvincing”. He had not made a note of his observation. Nor had he incorporated that observation in the statement he made some months afterwards. The photographs taken at the scene did not include photographs of the hair. 
      
       
     32 Secondly, the account given by the accused provided a reasonable and plausible explanation for the only evidence which may be thought incriminating, namely, the fingerprints and the hair. The jury, in these circumstances, in the appellant’s submission, ought to have regarded the appellant’s version as being possibly true. The Crown had not established that his account was necessarily false. An acquittal should therefore be entered. 
      
       
     33 I am not persuaded by either of these arguments. Although it was perhaps surprising that the Federal Police Officer had failed to make a note of his observation, and had failed to incorporate that observation into his statement, there can be no doubt that hair was adhering to the tape. Indeed, it was adhering to four tapes. Hair was observed by a number of scientists. A specimen of the Caucasian hair, said to be consistent with that of Mr Anderson, was mounted on a slide by one scientist for the purpose of microscopic examination. The appellant, moreover, said in his evidence that he could recall losing hair on three occasions as he fumbled with the package and his arm snagged the tape. 
      
       
     34 Moving to the second argument, an appellate Court must enquire whether a reasonable jury ought to have found that an inference inconsistent with guilt was open on the evidence (Knight v The Queen (1992) 175 CLR 495). That requires a determination as to whether the jury was entitled to reject as a reasonable possibility the alternative explanation proffered by an accused. If they were, then there is no basis for interfering with the verdict. It is only where the Court concludes that the jury were not so entitled that it may interfere, as it did in Knight v The Queen. 
      
       
     35 Here the Crown case was considerably broader than the fingerprints and hair, important though they were. Mr Anderson acknowledged that, in the course of the aeroplane journey to Australia, it became clear to him that his three companions had knowledge of the drugs. One infers that the purpose of the short trip was the importation of drugs. Why, in these circumstances, would Mr Stan Hokafonu have repeatedly invited Mr Anderson to accompany the group to the United States? Whilst it may be accepted that Mr Anderson was depressed, the suggestion that his friends recognised his need for a holiday with them, when their purpose was drug importation, was implausible. Further, it was clear that the drugs had been taped to the bodies of Mr Anderson’s Tongan companions. That, no doubt, was the explanation for Tongan body hair on three pieces of tape. Mr Anderson provided a different explanation for the Caucasian hair on the fourth tape, namely accidental contact. Acceptance of that possibility involved, amongst other things, acceptance of the evidence of Mr Anderson that the tape inside the bag was loose. The evidence was, however, that the tape with the fingerprints on the under side was adhering to the package. The removal of the tape was effected by freezing the package, as described. The jury was entitled to reject accidental contact as a reasonable possibility. It was entitled to infer that Mr Anderson went to the United States for the purpose of assisting in the concealment and transportation of a significant quantity of drugs. 
      
       
     36 The Crown, in its submission, drew attention to the remarks of Barwick CJ in Grant v R (1976) 11 ALR 503, which are apposite: (at 505) 
      
       
        
         
         “The case was in truth a very simple one. The jury were presented by the accused with an issue which turned entirely upon his own credit. He gave evidence, and quite evidently from the verdict they returned the jury did not believe him.” 
         
        
       
     37 In my view, the jury was entitled to reject the appellant’s version as the way in which the fingerprints and hair came to be on the adhesive tape. Having rejected that version, they were entitled to convict. 
      
       
     38 I believe, therefore, that there is no substance in the second ground. 
      
       
        
       Order 
       
     39 I therefore propose that the appeal should be dismissed.

      R v EARL ROBERT CARTER 
       
       
      SENTENCE 
      
    1 His Honour: On 15 August 2001 the prisoner, Earl Carter, was indicted on a charge of murdering Renae Michelle Sabine on 14 May 2000. The prisoner pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to dangerous driving causing death contrary to s 52A of the Crimes Act 1900. The Crown did not accept this plea and the trial of the prisoner on the charge of murder proceeded before the jury. 
    2 On 30 August 2001 the jury convicted the prisoner of murder. He was then remanded in custody until 2 November 2001 for sentence. On that day the matter was not in a position to proceed because reports and other evidence, which the prisoner wished to rely upon, had not been obtained. I adjourned the matter until today after I had received evidence and heard submissions from both counsel last week. 
    3 The facts upon which the prisoner is to be sentenced can be briefly stated because by having regard to the way in which the Crown case was presented to them, the jury by their verdict must have found the facts proved beyond reasonable doubt within a very narrow compass. On 13 May 2000, a party was held at 8 Drummond Street, Moree to celebrate the birthday of one of the residents, Steven Shearer. The party commenced early that evening and a large number of young persons came and went throughout the night. Most of those present consumed alcohol that they had brought with them. Despite the varying levels of intoxication of the persons who observed the events giving rise to the charge, the accounts given are generally consistent and reliable. 
    4 Sometime around 9.30 pm the party gravitated towards the front of the house and a fire drum was brought into the front yard so that the persons present could warm themselves. The prisoner, who was a work colleague of Mr Shearer, arrived at the party at about this time with Colin Woodward, a friend of his. He had parked his vehicle outside a block of flats in Boundary Street, around the corner and a short distance away from the residence where the party was being held. 
    5 Later in the evening a number of persons who were associated with the local rugby team arrived at the party. They included the deceased who had been driven to the party in a friend’s Magna sedan motor vehicle. Some time later that vehicle was moved from the front of number 8 and parked on the opposite side of the road, parallel with but just off the edge of the bitumen surface. 
    6 During the course of the evening the prisoner became involved in an altercation with one of the persons from the rugby club, Tyson Conroy. It seems that an item had been dropped into the fire drum and the prisoner issued something of a challenge to the effect that Mr Conroy should remove this item from the fire using his bare hand. The challenge was not accepted but the prisoner reached into the drum and took out a burning ember that he held in his hand for a few seconds. This was apparently something of a party trick that the prisoner occasionally performed, using a cold drink can to insulate his hand before inserting it into the fire. Rather than appreciating this act of bravado, the group around the fire-drum derided the prisoner for what they perceived to be an act of stupidity. Unfortunately the prisoner had also performed the act incompetently and suffered significant burns to his hand. As a result of the insults and the injury, the prisoner became involved in the trading of insults with Mr Conroy. A physical altercation between the two was averted when one of Mr Conroy’s group intervened and told him that it was not worth the effort. The group and the prisoner then parted company. 
    7 At about 1 am the prisoner and others assisted Mr Shearer in persuading people to leave the premises in order to bring the party to an end. The crowd, which included most of the persons associated with the rugby club, moved out on to the verge in front of the house. Some also moved to the other side of the road near to where the Magna vehicle had been parked. The group was considering what they might then do to entertain themselves. 
    8 During this time an altercation occurred between the prisoner and the deceased’s boyfriend, Todd Brown. Mr Brown was in the company of a group of his friends, including the deceased and Tyson Conroy near the front gate but outside of the premises. The prisoner approached this group and said something to them that indicated he believed they were talking about his father. An argument ensued between the prisoner and Mr Brown, which culminated in the prisoner challenging the other to a fight. The deceased intervened telling the prisoner to go away. Mr Brown then commenced to ridicule the prisoner and made somewhat offensive remarks and jokes at the expense of him and his mother much to the amusement of those gathered around him including the deceased.  
    9 Mr Shearer, fearing that the situation was getting out of hand, suggested that the prisoner should leave. The prisoner thought that this was somewhat unjust, as he did not believe that he was responsible for the altercation with Mr Brown and his group. However, the prisoner commenced to make his way down Drummond Street towards the units where he had parked his vehicle. As he did so, Mr Brown continued to pour scorn on the prisoner. There was the evidence that the deceased herself had made some offensive remarks to the prisoner as he left. 
    10 As the prisoner walked down the street he occasionally turned to face the group and directed insults and threats toward them. There was evidence that the prisoner indicated that he would be back shortly and he would show them who was “chicken”. There was also evidence, which I believe the jury must have accepted, that the prisoner made threats to kill them. 
    11 The prisoner reached the flats at Boundary Street and went towards his vehicle. Persons who were then in one of the flats gave evidence that they heard the prisoner at this time muttering about the fact that his mother had been insulted and threatening to get back at the persons who had been at the party. As the prisoner entered his vehicle preparing to drive away, two of the persons at the flats at the time, who knew him, Michael Fletcher and Ms Walton, tried to reason with him and persuade him to get out of his vehicle. However, it was to no avail and the prisoner drove the vehicle out of the yard at a fast speed losing control of it as he left the premises and entered into Boundary Street. The vehicle came to a halt off the road surface and near a fence. 
    12 At this time Mr Woodward, who had followed the prisoner from the party, approached the vehicle. The prisoner told him to get inside if he wanted a lift. Mr Fletcher again approached the vehicle and tried to dissuade the prisoner from driving to the site of the party. But again the prisoner ignored him and drove off at speed towards Drummond Street. This was in the opposite direction to the prisoner’s home. As he turned the corner at the end of Boundary Street and into Drummond Street, the prisoner once more lost control of the vehicle. However he immediately took off again with Mr Fletcher and Ms Walton following as best they might, so concerned were they as to what might occur. 
    13 The prisoner proceeded at speed up Drummond Street until he was near the group of people who were standing around the Magna talking as they prepared to leave. This group included Mr Conroy who was at the boot of the vehicle, and Mr Brown who I believe was standing alongside the deceased at the driver’s side of the vehicle talking to persons in the vehicle. They were situated just off the road surface and up against the motor vehicle. The deceased was leaning into the driver’s window. The prisoner travelled in a relatively straight line on the correct side but near the middle of the road. However just before he reached the Magna, the prisoner swerved the vehicle to the left towards Mr Brown and those near him. 
    14 Mr Brown suddenly became aware of the vehicle approaching and yelled a warning to the others just before he jumped over the boot of the Magna. The deceased, however, had nowhere to go and remained where she stood. She was struck by the left side of the prisoner’s vehicle and thrown into the air. She came to rest in a table drain on the left hand side of the road ahead of the Magna. She was deceased before anyone could get to her. An autopsy later revealed that the deceased had died of injuries to the head, and that she would have been rendered unconscious almost immediately. 
    15 The prisoner did not stop the vehicle straight away after striking the deceased but continued a few blocks before stopping in front of his mother’s home. While he and Mr Woodward sat in the vehicle taking stock of what had occurred, Mr Brown arrived in the Magna. He noted the number plate of the prisoner’s vehicle, before driving away. The prisoner then drove to Moree police station where he reported to a police officer that he had been involved in a hit and run accident. He told the officer that he had hit a girl and had panicked. After undergoing an alcohol breath test, which revealed a positive reading, the prisoner was placed under arrest. He admitted to police that he had struck the deceased, but said that he did not intend to hit her. A short time later, the prisoner was charged with murder. 
    16 The prisoner admitted consuming a substantial quantity of alcohol during the evening. In the course of his evidence at the trial, he told the jury that he felt drunk that night. The police officers who spoke with him at the police station assessed him as being moderately affected by alcohol, although he did not appear to have difficulty walking or carrying out a conversation. A breath-analysis taken sometime after 3 am produced a reading of 0.125 grams per 100 millilitres. It was the opinion of Dr Perl that at the time of the incident the prisoner would have had a blood alcohol level in the range of 0.1 to 0.15, but probably closer to the lower end of that range. 
    17 The prisoner gave evidence at the trial that he decided to drive his vehicle home after leaving the party, but thought that he would drive past the group outside number 8 in order to have the final word. He said that as he came towards the Magna he was forced to veer to the left to avoid persons who were in the middle of the roadway. He endeavoured to steer a course between the persons and the Magna, but that he must have struck the deceased in doing so. In effect he maintained that he swerved the vehicle as a defensive measure. 
    18 The jury were directed that they could find the accused guilty of murder only if they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that when he swerved the vehicle towards the Magna he did so as an intentional act of retribution towards those who had humiliated him. Further they were told that they must find that when he swerved the vehicle he intended by that act to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm upon some person in the vicinity of the Magna or with reckless indifference to the life of some such person. The jury, having convicted the accused, must have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he drove the vehicle as an offensive act of violence. The jury were directed on provocation but in my view found that any provocation was not such as would affect a reasonable person to the degree of forming the intent to murder. 
    19 Mr Fitzgerald, who appeared for the prisoner, submitted that having regard to the evidence before the jury and in particular the evidence of Dr Perl to which I have referred earlier, I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner intended either to kill some person or that he acted with reckless indifference to human life. Although Mr Fitzgerald acknowledges that I am not required to sentence the prisoner on the view most favourable to him and in accordance with the jury verdict that in this particular case I should do so having regard to the whole of the evidence placed before the jury. 
    20 The Crown has submitted that in the circumstances of this particular case given the nature of the means used to inflict injury or death being a motor vehicle driven at a speed estimated at between 60 and 80 kph by a person who was under the influence of intoxicating liquor, there was little point in trying to determine what particular intention the prisoner had at the time that he committed the act causing the death of the deceased. The Crown submitted that a person in the inebriated state of the prisoner would hardly have been capable of determining that he would drive the motor vehicle at a person or persons intending only to inflict grievous bodily harm on that person or persons and no more. 
    21 I believe there is some merit in the argument of the Crown. One can readily imagine a set of facts where the prisoner might clearly have an intention only to inflict grievous bodily harm and no further injury but then bring about the death of the deceased therefore making him liable for murder. In such a situation, the fact that the prisoner did not intend to kill the person is a significant mitigating factor in an assessment of the objective facts of the offence. But in this particular case, where as I have indicated, the prisoner was under the influence of alcohol, in a highly angry and emotional state, and using a motor vehicle driven at a relatively high speed as a weapon against unprotected persons on the side of the road, there would be little difference in his culpability for the death of one of those persons whatever might be the state of mind with which he did the act. 
    22 However, I have no doubt that in the present case, having regard to what the prisoner said both as he left the party, and arriving at the flats to get his motor vehicle that the jury determined that he had the intention of killing some person at the motor vehicle: that particular person being Mr Brown. 
    23 I have no doubt at all that the person who was the focus of the prisoner’s anger was Mr Brown and not the deceased. Although I left provocation to the jury based upon statements made by the deceased at the time of the argument between the prisoner and Mr Brown and because she would have been seen by the prisoner as being in Mr Brown’s camp, she was not the person who the prisoner sought to punish. It was Mr Brown with whom the prisoner had been arguing immediately before he left the party to retrieve the motor vehicle and it was Mr Brown who was the person who was heaping scorn upon him and his mother. Mr Brown was also distinguishable from most other persons in the group because he was taller than most of them. I believe that the prisoner identified Mr Brown at the Magna as he drove up the road. There was nothing to indicate to the prisoner, when he left the party, that the Magna motor vehicle was associated with the group to which Mr Brown and the deceased belonged. 
    24 I have no doubt that the prisoner returned to the scene intending retaliation for the injury inflicted on his pride by the group in general and Mr Brown in particular. He had twice been made a laughing stock by these persons. Although there was some evidence to suggest that Mr Brown was at the boot of the vehicle as the prisoner approached the Magna, I am satisfied that the true situation was that Mr Brown was at the side of the vehicle beside the deceased and nearest to the prisoner’s vehicle as it approached. I believe that Mr Brown having seen the prisoner’s vehicle approaching managed to avoid it leaving the deceased exposed and so she was struck and fatally injured. It was, therefore, the hapless deceased who felt the full brunt of the prisoner’s anger which was directed at Mr Brown. 
    25 The offence is a serious case of murder because it was to some degree pre-meditated and because once the prisoner decided to use his vehicle as a weapon, there was a high risk of serious injury or death to any person in the vicinity of the Magna, not just Mr Brown. The prisoner had time before he reached his vehicle to reconsider what he would do, but clearly he used that period to mull over what had occurred and maintain his rage if not increase it. More significantly there were persons who tried to intervene and to reason with, and counsel, him against what he was obviously intending to do. But there is no doubt that blinded by anger and fuelled by alcohol the prisoner had lost his self-control to the point that he was incapable of being reasoned with. 
    26 I do take into account, although the jury clearly were persuaded that the prisoner was not acting under provocation as the law understands it, that he was provoked to some degree by what had occurred during the course of the party. That is no way intended to suggest that those persons are in any way responsible for what occurred or in the slightest could be considered responsible for the death of the deceased. 
    27 At the time of the incidents giving rise to the death of the deceased, the prisoner was aged 28 years. He has no relevant prior history and I treat him as a man of prior good character. There was evidence before me from the prisoner’s stepmother that she had never seen the prisoner angry, violent or aggressive towards any other person even when under the influence of intoxicating liquor. She described the prisoner as a loner who generally did not mix well with persons outside his extended family and was wary of persons whom he did not know well. Mrs Carter gave evidence of the prisoner’s background but little of it seems to me to be relevant to the task before me except that she indicates that at the time of the killing of the deceased the prisoner was in a stable relationship with a young lady and he had living with him his two children of a previous relationship which was a matter of significant importance to him. He was employed and apparently enjoying life. In other words there is nothing either in the prisoner’s history or in his circumstances at the time of the offence that might explain his conduct on this particular night. His large extended family are prepared to assist him and support him throughout his sentence and when released. 
    28 There was evidence given before me by Mr Foster who had known the prisoner since 1992 due to their being employed by the same employer. Mr Foster’s evidence has little relevance to the present matter except to confirm that the prisoner was generally well regarded both as a worker and as a member of the community. In particular, Mr Foster gave evidence that the prisoner was generally a shy person who tended to keep to himself even in social occasions. Mr Foster had never witnessed the prisoner acting in an aggressive manner even when under the influence of intoxicating liquor. At this stage Mr Foster indicated that he would be prepared to employ the prisoner when he is eventually released from custody. 
    29 In an attempt to explain why it might be that the type of person described by Mrs Carter and Mr Foster might act in the way that the prisoner did on this particular night, a psychological report was placed before me on behalf of the prisoner. Again there is nothing in the background or upbringing of the prisoner that appears to me to have any bearing on the sentencing of him for this offence except for two matters. The first is that the prisoner had a learning disability at school that resulted in him leaving school unable to read or write. He attended TAFE and acquired basic literacy skills. School apparently was not a happy experience and he was sensitive about his deficiencies in this regard. The second matter which was in the psychologist’s report is his mistrust of others and his concern with social rebuff. The psychologist described him as being a person who anticipated, as well as elicited, rejection. 
    30 The relevance of these matters becomes apparent to me in the evidence both as to his act of misplaced bravado at the fire drum and that when challenging Mr Conroy and his group at the fire, he referred to them in terms of being “college boys”. This incident appears to me to be the genesis of the anger and humiliation that resulted in the killing of the deceased. Mr Brown unfortunately simply inflamed what was already smouldering within the prisoner after that incident. At the risk of indulging in homespun psychology, I believe that the prisoner has a very large chip on his shoulder which generally results in him appearing withdrawn and mistrustful but which on this occasion fuelled his belligerent attitude to the group including Mr Conroy, Mr Brown and the deceased. His involvement with these persons and his intoxicated state resulted in what was uncharacteristic aggression. There was a clear loss of control that resulted in the action he took in driving at the Magna to inflict grievous bodily harm or death. 
    31 I am satisfied that the prisoner is deeply remorseful for the death of the deceased, notwithstanding the plea of not guilty to murder. I can understand that a person of the prisoner’s normal disposition and character would find it incomprehensible that he could have done what he did and that this perhaps explains his denial of what was obvious on the evidence. He is of course not entitled to the benefit of a plea of guilty on utilitarian grounds but I would not find that he was devoid of compunction for what he had done. To some extent the fact that he went to the police and admitted hitting the deceased with his vehicle is real evidence of his contrition once he had regained his self-control. He appears to Mrs Carter to have been abnormally and uncharacteristically interested in death and the macabre while in custody. He is considered to be a suicide risk because of his depression. 
    32 I do not believe that there is any real prospect of the prisoner offending again. This incident was in my view the result of a combination of circumstances that are unlikely to recur after the prisoner is released from what must be a lengthy prison term. However, this is not to suggest that the prisoner may not need counselling or assistance both while in custody and on his release. Although special deterrence does not seem to me to have any relevance in this particular case there should be some regard to the element of general deterrence notwithstanding the relative infrequency of injuries or death caused by the intentional use of a vehicle as a weapon. Persons in the community must understand the serious consequences of using a vehicle as a means of expressing anger or as a weapon in seeking retribution or retaliation. It should be clear that a vehicle is a much more lethal weapon than a loaded gun or knife and the consequences of its use are much more difficult to control.  
    33 My attention was drawn to one other case which is said to have some similarities to the present and which I was asked to consider when determining the appropriate sentence to impose upon the prisoner. In R v Hall, Hidden J was required to sentence a young man after trial for murder and other serious offences of personal violence as a result of his use of a vehicle as a weapon. One person was killed and two seriously injured as a result of the accused making two passes through a group of persons one of whom had bested him in a fight. He was sentenced to effectively 20 years imprisonment. In that case the accused used the motor vehicle twice in order to injure persons. He was sentenced on the basis of acting with an intent to inflict grievous bodily harm which was apparently what the jury determined to be the basis of murder. The accused was younger than the prisoner and there was less premeditation than in the present case. The sentence imposed by Hidden J was held not to be excessive by the Court of Criminal Appeal of which I was a member, see [2001] NSWCCA 202. 
    34 There is nothing to be gained in this case by a consideration of statistics or other cases of murder. The sentence imposed by Hidden J was an exercise of discretion based upon his assessment of the particular facts and circumstances of the case before him, the task that I must perform based upon the facts and circumstances before me. There is material in the present case that might have given rise to a finding of special circumstances had the sentence to be imposed been less than is required to meet the offence of which the prisoner has been convicted. But the application of the statutory ratio in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 will result in a parole period long enough in my view to provide the prisoner with what assistance he might need when released again into the community. There has been no reason suggested on material advanced that would otherwise justify a reduction in the non-parole period. 
    35 This is another sad case where one young life has been needlessly lost and another destroyed by events on a single occasion where alcohol and stupidity were combined. And the damage caused by the prisoner’s criminal act goes further than that. Many person’s lives will never be the same again. I am informed that over 350 persons attended Renae’s funeral. I have received in evidence victim impact statements written by the deceased’s mother, grandmother and stepfather describing the person that Renae was and what her death means to them and how it has affected their lives. That material was not admitted for the purpose of increasing the sentence to be served by the prisoner and has not been used by me in any way to aggravate the severity of his crime. But the reception of such evidence permits the family of Renae to participate in the proceedings by expressing their grief and loss as a result of her death. It reminds the court, if it is necessary to do so, of the real human tragedy involved in matters that come before it. I understand that it is particularly difficult to come to grips with the death of a treasured family member when it occurs so pointlessly and unexpectedly. The court takes this opportunity to express it’s sympathy and understanding to those persons. 
    36 On the charge of murder the prisoner is sentenced to imprisonment for 18 years. There is to be a non-parole period of 13½ years. The sentence is to commence from 15 August 2001. That date is earlier than when the prisoner was convicted to take into account an earlier period of custody before he was released to bail. The non-parole period therefore will expire on 9 February 2015 the date upon which the prisoner will be eligible for release to parole. 
    37 In case anybody misunderstands the result of that sentence, it means the prisoner must remain in custody until 9 February 2015, and on that date he will be eligible to be released to parole if the Parole Board thinks it appropriate to do so.

      WARREN v REVESBY HEIGHTS EX-SERVICEMEN’S MEMORIAL CLUB LTD and ORS 
      
      
       
       The appellant suffered injuries when a participant in an organised billy-cart race left the road and collided with the appellant, who was watching from the side of the road. The billy cart race was organised as a charity event and the issue on appeal, as at trial, was liability, namely determining who it was that had organised and controlled the event. 
        
        
       Held: Per Stein JA (Mason P and Rolfe AJA agreeing) 
        
       
      1. The trial judge’s conclusion that the first respondent did not organise or control the event was open and consistent with the evidence. 
      
       
      2. It was open to the trial judge to find that the appellant had not established that the second respondent was in control of or organised the billy cart race.3. The trial judge’s finding that the third respondent did not organise or control the 1998 race was open and supported by evidence.4. The finding that the appellant’s accident was not foreseeable was available on the evidence. 
      
       
        
       Per Mason P 
        
       
     1. The failure to erect barriers that would have protected the class of spectators including the appellant did not indicate a breach of the duty to exercise reasonable care with respect to the safety of spectators and competitors.

      WARREN v REVESBY HEIGHTS EX-SERVICEMEN’S MEMORIAL CLUB LTD and ORS 
       
       
      Judgment 
       
     1 MASON P: I agree with the judgment of Stein JA. 
      
       
     2 I would add this. I am not persuaded that negligence was established against the person or persons who did organise the race. I accept that there was a foreseeable risk of some injury to some spectators given the capacity of billy carts racing against each other down a curving slope of roadway to collide. But, as the trial judge remarked, they were billy carts and not formula one speedcars. The appellant positioned himself and his young children on a grassy nature strip on the inside of a curved portion of the roadway. Perhaps he had good reason to expect that certifugal force made it safe to sit there, rather than on the other side of the road. Perhaps the presence of barriers on the opposite side could have impeded his view. Accepting as I do that the organisers of the event had a duty to exercise reasonable care as regards the safety of competitors and spectators alike, I am not persuaded that failure to erect barriers that would have protected the class of spectators that included the appellant betokened breach of such a duty.  
      
       
     3 STEIN JA: The appellant sued three defendants for damages for negligence arising out of injuries he received on 22 March 1998. He failed against each defendant and appeals with the leave of the court. 
      
       
     4 On Sunday, 22 March 1998 he was a spectator seated on a grass verge at the side of Centaur Street, Revesby Heights. An event known as The Great Aussie Billy Cart Race was taking place and the road had been closed to allow the races to be held. 
      
       
     5 The plaintiff was sitting on the grass with his young children adjacent to a tree and near a driveway to a house. The races started some distance up a fairly steep hill from where the plaintiff was viewing. Large numbers of the public were also watching along the Centaur Street course. During one race two billy carts became entangled and one of them careered across the road up the driveway and collided with the plaintiff on the grass verge, injuring his left ankle. There were no barricades or barriers in place in the vicinity although there were some in place at other positions along the route. 
      
       
     6 Hogan ADCJ found that there was no contributory negligence and assessed the plaintiff’s damages at $16,650. However, the principal issue was liability and the question came down to who was it that organised and controlled the event. 
      
       
     7 As his Honour observed, the only material particular of negligence alleged a failure to provide proper safety barriers on the roadway so as to prevent the accident. As I have said, the plaintiff proceeded against three defendants. The first was the Revesby Heights Ex-Servicemen’s Memorial Club Ltd, a registered club, sometimes referred to in evidence as the ‘mother club’. The second was a Mr Bruce McFarlane and the third was the Revesby Heights Ex-Servicemen’s Junior Rugby League Football Club Inc. This was an incorporated association and one of a number of sporting clubs within the organisation of the mother club. I will refer to the third defendant as the football club. 
      
       
     8 The Billy Cart race had apparently commenced to be held in 1993. Mr McFarlane and a Mr Anderson (who was neither a party nor called to give evidence) were apparently involved from its inception. Indeed, it may have been their idea. Be that as it may, it seems that for each of the years from 1993 to 1997 the race and associated Billy Cart Ball were organised and controlled by the football club, which received all of the profits. 
      
       
     9 By August 1997 a dispute arose as to whether other sporting clubs should share in the profits with the football club. Mr McFarlane and Mr Anderson left their positions on the football club and advocated a sharing of profits. A letter from the first defendant registered club to the football club dated 26 August 1997 confirmed that it was content that the football club conduct the race in 1998 under its (the football club’s) banner and the first defendant would be a sponsor. 
      
       
     10 However, by 17 September 1997 the first defendant became concerned with the dispute between the football club and Mr McFarlane and Mr Anderson and others. It appointed one of its directors, Mr Gordon, to mediate the dispute. The mediation did not appear to be wholly successful and on 13 November 1997 the football club wrote to the first defendant complaining of its loss of control of the race. 
      
       
     11 According to the evidence, by January 1998 the football club ceased to have any role in the organisation or control of the race. However, since it was to receive a percentage of the profits, it was expected to provide some volunteers to help with the barbeque and marshalling activities. 
      
       
     12 There is no doubt that significant organisation was necessary for the race, particularly on the day but also beforehand. Council permission had to be obtained to close the street. The street closure had to be advertised. Affected residents had to be notified. Barriers had to be placed for the street closures. Police, the fire brigade and ambulance authorities had to be notified to attend. Catering and prizes had to be arranged.  
      
       
     13 In 1997 the football club was responsible for all of these things. On 10 January 1998 the second defendant, Mr McFarlane caused a letter to be sent to the Council seeking its permission to hold the event on 22 March 1998. The letter was headed ‘Revesby Heights Billy Cart Club c/- Revesby Heights Ex-Servicemen’s Club’. It was signed by Mr McFarlane as ‘Secretary’ followed by his telephone numbers. Mr McFarlane had adopted a precedent from a previous year and altered it as was necessary.  
      
       
     14 On 5 March 1998 the Council wrote to ‘The Secretary, Revesby Heights Ex-Servicemen’s Club’ for the attention of Mr Bruce McFarlane and commencing ‘Dear Mr McFarlane’. The Council indicated that approval had been granted subject to four conditions, the last of which was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         The Revesby Heights Ex-Servicemen’s Club is be responsible for all traffic control and for installing and maintaining appropriate road closure safety barricades. 
         
        
       
     15 The letter was never received by the first defendant. Neither was it received by the football club. Nor it is clear that Mr McFarlane ever received it. 
      
       
     16 At some later stage the street closure was advertised in the Bankstown Torch. Mr McFarlane delivered the copy to the newspaper office. He said that he did this because he was nearby and passed the Torch office three times a day. None of the defendants accepted that they paid for the advertisement. 
      
       
     17 His Honour said that it was clear that the first defendant registered club took no part in actually organising the event. This must be right. It did however provide some equipment, which included barbecues and road barriers, as well as providing hospitality at the club premises. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         … there is no evidence on which I am prepared to find that in matters concerning the actual running of the race the registered club was directly responsible, or that those who did organise the race were in any way subject to its control or direction.  
         
        
       
     18 This was a conclusion which was perfectly open to his Honour and consistent with the evidence. Such involvement as the registered club had was peripheral and in no way can it be concluded that it organised or controlled the event. The fact that the Council directed its approval to the first defendant is immaterial. The registered club never applied for approval and never received the Council letter. The letter from the Council cannot be seen as imposing any obligation on the registered club regarding the control of the event. It knew nothing about the letter. His Honour was correct to find a judgment for the first defendant. 
      
       
     19 In turning to the position of the football club, his Honour noted that it had organised and controlled the race in 1997. However, he said that it was clear ‘that it did not actually undertake that responsibility in 1998’. 
      
       
     20 This was a finding which was in accordance with the bulk of the evidence. The football club, having been annoyed at the dispute about splitting the profits with other sporting clubs within the registered club, and its losing control of the race, more or less withdrew from the planning of the event in around January 1998. On the day of the race it did see that a number of its members participated as volunteers. If it had not done this, its share in the profits might have been in jeopardy. 
      
       
     21 It is apparent that his Honour’s conclusion that the football club did not control or organise the 1998 race was open and supported by evidence. 
      
       
     22 That leaves the second defendant, Mr McFarlane. Of his position his Honour said this: 
      
       
        
         
         … although the second defendant played some part in the continuation of this event, with which he had been so closely associated in the past, I do not think that his involvement was such as to fix him with any responsibility for ensuring the safety of spectators. Some person obviously did make a decision about the placing of safety barriers, because some were installed lower down the hill. It may be suggested that such a person should have given thought to placing a barrier near where the plaintiff was seated. Even if that were so there is no evidence that the second defendant was that person, nor is there anything in the circumstances that would persuade me that the second defendant should be responsible as a joint tortfeasor with that person.  
         
        
       
     23 Mr McFarlane categorically denied that he (and/or Mr Anderson) did anything about running the 1998 race except that he had sent the letter of application to the Council and dropped off the street closure advertisement at the newspaper office. He said that no one told him to organise the event nor did he take any steps to close the street or notify the emergency services. He said that he had no part in the placement of the barriers on the race day. 
      
       
     24 His Honour made no adverse credit finding regarding Mr McFarlane. Hogan ADCJ was in the best position to assess his evidence and it is inappropriate that this court intervene to re-assess his credit. His Honour’s findings make it plain that he accepted Mr McFarlane’s explanations as to why he did what he did and his denials that he organised or controlled the 1998 event, either by himself, or with Mr Anderson, or others. 
      
       
     25 In my opinion, it was open to his Honour to find that the plaintiff had not established that Mr McFarlane was in control of or organised the 1998 race. 
      
       
     26 It follows that his Honour was entitled to find a verdict in favour of each of the defendants.27 I add that his Honour also found that the plaintiff’s accident was not foreseeable. This was a finding open to his Honour on the facts although it is noted that there was evidence from a Mr Hunt which could suggest that an accident was foreseeable. 
      
       
     28 This is an unfortunate case in many ways. It involves modest damages. It is plain that someone (or a group) organised and controlled the event and determined where the safety barriers were to be placed around the course. Unfortunately for the plaintiff, with whom I sympathise, he bears an onus of proving on the balance of probabilities that it was one or all of the defendants. He failed to establish that any of the defendants controlled the event on the day. 
      
       
     29 Accordingly, the appeal must be dismissed with costs. 
      
       
     30 ROLFE AJA: I agree with Mason P and Stein JA.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
     1 GREG JAMES, J: This is an application for leave to appeal against a sentence of two years imprisonment with a non-parole period of one year imposed upon the applicant in the District Court of New South Wales on 11 April 2001. The sentence was imposed in respect of the crime of which the applicant had been convicted, following a trial before her Honour Judge Backhouse of Queen's Counsel, and a jury in the District Court. 
      
       
     2 He had been convicted on three counts; the first a count of dangerous driving occasioning death, an offence under s.52A(1)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900, for which the maximum penalty is ten years imprisonment. The second and third counts had been counts of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm. These are crimes provided for by s.52A(3)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900, for which the maximum penalty prescribed is seven years imprisonment. 
      
       
     3 The applicant had pleaded not guilty and relied at trial upon an explanation for the vehicle he was driving moving to the incorrect side of the road; that is, that it was affected by a mechanical defect. It is apparent that the jury rejected that explanation. 
      
       
     4 It is far more difficult to deal with what was inherent in the case against him as his culpable conduct than it is to define what was not the cause of the vehicle departing from the correct side of the road to the incorrect side of the road, and occasioning the collision which caused the injuries leading to the charges. 
      
       
     5 Following the verdict, the trial judge, in her remarks on sentence, referred to the nature of the applicant's conduct, firstly, when she came to set out the circumstances of the commission of the offence, and subsequently when she came to categorise the relevant conduct, in order to have regard to a decision of this court in Regina v. Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209. She described the applicant's conduct as follows:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""The prisoner was driving his Hiace van in a westerly direction on the Great Western Highway near Springwood on 17 April 2000. He was returning from a bread delivery in Sydney. It was about 11.30 am and it was a fine, sunny day. He was travelling in the lane closest to the median strip. There were two lanes for vehicles travelling in each direction on the highway with a concrete median strip. The section of the roadway which was near the Hawkesbury Road overpass, the prisoner's vehicle crossed over the median strip. The median strip at this point was less than two metres wide. The prisoner was travelling at 80 kilometres per hour which was the speed limited for that section of the roadway and prior to his vehicle crossing the median strip he had entered a sweeping left hand bend in the highway and his vehicle then travelled across the median strip onto the incorrect side of the roadway and collided with the vehicle being driven by Ian Hardimon in an easterly direction. 
         
        
        
         
         There was evidence before the court from Mr. Goodwin, who was travelling in the same direction as the prisoner. He recalled that he had been following him for some two to three kilometres and that the prisoner was travelling approximately 200 metres in front of him. The van then went out of his vision. Then he, Mr. Goodwin, started to enter the left hand bend, he was doing 80 kilometres per hour, and he went around the bend and he saw the van on the other side of the road. He indicated that whilst he was following the prisoner's vehicle he didn't seem to be getting away from him, that he was maintaining the same speed as he was. 
         
        
        
         
         The prisoner gave evidence and he stated that he was headed back from Sydney to Katoomba on the Great Western Highway. He told the court that he had earlier notices what he thought could be a problem with his wheel alignment, but continued to proceed towards Katoomba. He recalled the left hand bend and he said he realised there was a delay in the steering. He past (sic) over the median strip, without being able to make the turn. He said he was unable to explain in any detail how it happened. He did say that he had no time to apply the brakes. He said the van bounced so heavily he was carried onto the other side of the road. He said there was speed signs at various points because there were road works and that those speed limits were 40 to 80 kilometres on hour. He himself was, at the time of the collision, travelling at about 80 kilometres per hour. HE said that he was just concentrating on his driving. He was alert. He did not feel tired. He prisoner went onto say that immediately after the collision he was in a state of shock himself in particular when he became aware of the horrific nature of the accident and that other people were involved."" 
         
        
       
     6 It is notable that in that recital her Honour referred to the vehicle of the prisoner travelling on to the incorrect side of the road without making any express finding as to what might have caused it to take that course. She referred to the prisoner's account that there was some steering difficulty, his inability to explain in any detail as to how it happened, and his assertion of the lack of time to apply the brakes. 
      
       
     7 Her Honour found the offences to be extremely serious ones, involving as they did, the death of one person and the grievous bodily harm to two others, one of whom was a 10 year old child. There was, she pointed out at the trial, evidence rebutting the suggestion of mechanical defect. In attempting to embark on that categorisation process, to which I have referred, she said the following:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""The Crown case put to the jury was that the manner of driving dangerously was the driving of the vehicle onto the wrong side of the road. Clearly the jury have accepted that that was the situation by their verdicts. So much may be accepted; that is, that the applicant's vehicle came in some manner to the incorrect side of the road."" 
         
        
       
     8 Her Honour went on to note the Crown's concession:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""This is not a case which comes within the matters which were listed by Spigelman, CJ. in  
         The 
           
         Queen v. Jurisic 
          of 12 October 1998. There, the court mentions a number of these matters, which the Chief Justice pointed out are reflected in the definition of certain circumstances of the aggravation in s.52A(7) for the purposes of the two higher offences."" 
         
        
       
     9 Her Honour there is referring to matters of statutory aggravation noted by the Chief Justice in his judgment. She excludes the suggestion that the applicant had committed the crime whilst driving at an excessive speed or under the influence of alcohol. She further excludes the matters referred to set out by the Chief Justice in Jurisic (supra) at 239 as relevant to penalty numbered (vi) to (ix). Factors (iii) ""speed"" and (iv) ""degree of intoxication in substance abuse"" she had already excluded. The remaining two factors referred to the extent and nature of the injuries inflicted, and the number of people at risk. 
      
       
     10 It can be seen that so far at least in her Honour's remarks there has been no definition of the culpable conduct, but she turned to consider what the culpable conduct was by examining two terms used in that judgment, and said:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""Moving to the aspect of whether this was a matter involving momentary inattention or mis-judgment ... "" 
         
        
       
     11 She noted the Crown's submission that this was not a case of momentary inattention and the defence submission that the court could regard the circumstances on the basis of mis-judgment. She concludes that the evidence would not support ""momentary inattention"" since she refers to the evidence of the prisoner himself that at the time he was alert and concentrating on his driving. 
      
       
     12 She notes the Crown's submission in reply to the suggestion that mis-judgment was involved, that mis-judgment would involve the driver taking a deliberate course. She accepts the Crown submission that mis-judgment was not involved, on the basis, apparently, that there was no suggestion the applicant deliberately chose to take such a course as would put his vehicle on the wrong side of the road. She notes a submission made by the Crown that this is a case where it falls between ""momentary inattention"" and what was said in the decision of Jurisic (supra). 
      
       
     13 At no point, to this stage at least, of her remarks on sentence, does her Honour define, even in general terms, what the nature of the conduct was, giving rise to culpability, except in the negative manner that I have referred to by ruling out application to the conduct which brought the vehicle to the wrong side of the road of certain of the terms used in Jurisic (supra). 
      
       
     14 Later, she turns to the question of whether this might be one of those exceptional cases referred to in Jurisic (supra) whereby a full-time custodial sentence is not required. In dealing with that matter, she notes that in Jurisic (supra) it has been said that a non-custodial sentence for an offence of this kind should be exceptional and almost invariably confined to cases involving momentary inattention or mis-judgment. 
      
       
     15 At the conclusion of her remarks appears the following:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""The final issue was whether it falls within what has been described as the exception when a non-custodial sentence may be appropriate for an offence such as this. There is room for a finding other than involving momentary inattention or mis-judgment, but in my view this is not a case where the Court can find that it is an exceptional case. It is certainly not a case which is one which does not involve any of those factors, factors which are referred to before."" 
         
        
       
     16 There her Honour appears to be referring to the factors set out in Jurisic (supra) which I have already related. Thereafter her Honour makes no particular finding as to the nature of the conduct which would permit an assessment of its culpability but, having regard to all the other circumstances, including the responsibility the prisoner has for the death and injuries caused, and the subjective circumstances which she held were quite strong subjective circumstances in his favour, and which were set out in the pre-sentence report, she concluded that she should impose the sentence for the term of two years, to which I have referred. 
      
       
     17 In addition, she imposed the various disqualifications required by the legislation, and for two years also. The sentences that were imposed were concurrent. Her Honour found, but did not expressly enumerate, that there were special circumstances which enabled the variation of the statutory provision of parole period to non-parole period. Her Honour, when she imposed the non-parole period, insofar as I can see, did not order the prisoner's release at the expiration of the non-parole period. 
      
       
     18 As the challenge to the sentence has proceeded in this court, it has been articulated from time to time differently. It has been contended that it was not open to her Honour on the evidence to conclude that this offence was as serious as she must have concluded it to be, to impose the sentence that she did. It was articulated as a challenge on the basis that her Honour had fallen into error in failing to conclude it was an offence of mere momentary inattention. 
      
       
     19 In the upshot, the submission came down to the proposition that there was no finding of her Honour as to the factual circumstances of the offence such as would warrant a sentence of the severity she imposed. It will be apparent from the discussion of her Honour's remarks on sentence that I have undertaken that at no time does her Honour describe the conduct clearly and specifically. Her rejection of the labels of ""mis-judgment"" and ""momentary inattention"", to which I have referred, must be considered in the context of her conclusion that there was room for a finding other than that involving momentary inattention or mis-judgment. 
      
       
     20 However one looks at the matter, the reasons as expressed are anything but satisfactory as defining a basis on which a sentence of some considerable degree of seriousness such as this has been passed. In the Crown's submission, although the Crown sought to uphold the sentence, it was conceded that whatever the conduct was, it fell within the lower or lowest range of culpable conduct, whatever label might otherwise appropriately be attached to it, and that the offender should have been sentenced on the basis that his conduct was properly to be put within the lower range of culpability for this offence. 
      
       
     21 It was submitted by the Crown, however, that it was not such an exceptional case as in the Crown's submission should receive a non-custodial sentence, but it was conceded, however, that it was not possible, on the remarks on sentence and the findings, to relate the sentence that had been passed to specific conduct such that one could see that the sentence was supported by an appropriate finding of the objective culpability. It was conceded, in short, that it was open to this court to impose a much lesser sentence, and to do so on the basis that an essential finding had not been made such as to justify the sentence which was passed, although it was submitted that a custodial sentence was required. 
      
       
     22 The Crown's submission should not be misstated. It is not a submission that the Court would interfere and impose a lesser sentence. It is a submission, however, that in the light of the examination of the trial judge's reasoning, it is simply not possible to find articulated a sufficient basis for that sentence. 
      
       
     23 In the view that I have come to, I do not see that there has been a sufficient articulation of a reasoned basis, putting aside the labels, for the imposition of the sentence that was passed. 
      
       
     24 In those circumstances, it is open to the court to intervene. I have not, on the trial judge's findings, in my view, an adequate basis to conclude that it is such an exceptional case as might merit an entirely non-custodial penalty, or a penalty of a custodial nature which should be entirely suspended. Noting the evidence to which we were referred, I accept the trial judge's view, and share it, that there plainly are subjective circumstances advantaging the appellant. 
      
       
     25 Having regard to the fact that the applicant has already spent a substantial period in custody, and to the subjective matters to which her Honour refers, as well as the difficulty, particularly after a criminal trial, in seeking to define the nature of the conduct attracting culpability, I have concluded that the best one can do would be to quash the sentences her Honour passed and to pass in lieu of those sentences, sentences to commence on 11 April 2001, the date on which her Honour proposed the sentence would commence. On the first count, I would impose a sentence of 16 months imprisonment, together with a non-parole period of eight months. On counts two and three, I would impose concurrent fixed term sentences of eight months. 
      
       
     26 Those sentences would be concurrent with each other and with the sentence imposed on the first count, so as to provide, therefore, for a release date of 10 December 2001 and I would, in accordance with the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, direct the release of the applicant on parole, that direction to take effect immediately. 
      
       
     27 I would confirm the disqualification from driving imposed by her Honour the trial judge. 
      
       
     28 I should not pass from this matter without my recording my gratitude to counsel for their submissions which have frankly attempted to deal with what has appeared to me to be a most difficult question.  
      
       
     29 The orders I propose are as I have set out in my earlier reasons for judgment. 
      
       
     30 BELL, J: I agree. 
      
       
     31 GREG JAMES, J: Those are the orders.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
     1 GREG JAMES, J: This is an application by the Crown pending an appeal which is listed in the Court for 30 January 2002. That appeal, so we are told, involves some question of the applicant calling fresh evidence, as to the circumstances of entering the plea to the offence, from two persons who he informs us have been the subject of some harassment since he made it known that there were persons who might give evidence on his behalf in the Court of Criminal Appeal. 
      
       
     2 The Crown seeks a direction that, if their evidence is to be given in this court, the usual practice be followed: they file affidavits as to the matters about which it is sought that they should give evidence in chief and be available for cross-examination. 
      
       
     3 That application is opposed on the basis that it is said they might be the subject of some threat which might cause their evidence to be withdrawn. 
      
       
     4 However, once the affidavits are filed, the evidence cannot be, as it were, withdrawn. The evidence is filed in permanent form with the Court and may be relied on even in the case of a change of evidence in certain circumstances referred to in the Evidence Act 1995. The very filing of the affidavits might well go some way to avoiding the very danger of which the applicant speaks. 
      
       
     5 For my part, I am of the view that no such reason has been advanced as should require other than the usual course being taken; that is, that a direction should be given that the applicant, should he wish to rely on fresh evidence, should file and serve affidavits from his witnesses in a timely manner to permit the Crown to know the nature of the case it has to meet. 
      
       
     6 I propose a direction that the affidavits be provided on or before Monday 21 January 2002. 
      
       
     7 BELL, J: I agree.

      REGINA v. MICHAEL SHANE RUDENKO 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
      
       
     1 GREG JAMES, J: This is an application for leave to appeal in respect of sentence imposed in the District Court of New South Wales for the crime of robbery. That is a crime to which s.94 of the Crimes Act 1900 refers and is punishable by a maximum penalty of 14 years' imprisonment. In addition, the learned sentencing judge took into account on the applicant's plea of guilty, at his request, two matters on a Form 1, they being offences of knowingly take part in the cultivation of a prohibited plant and possess a prohibited drug, to wit cannabis seed. 
      
       
     2 His Honour imposed sentence, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, of imprisonment for three years and five months, commencing on 3 July 2000 and expiring on 2 December 2003. In respect of that sentence his Honour imposed a non-parole period of two years and six months, commencing on 3 July 2000 and expiring on 2 January 2003.  
      
       
     3 The applicant gave evidence on the plea. In respect to the robbery offence, the trial judge found that there was a degree of planning, that he did not accept the applicant as a witness of truth in relation to the relevant events and did not accept the applicant's explanation that what he showed to his victim was his wallet with a proof of age card in it. 
      
       
     4 His Honour, in an apparently carefully considered judgment, set out the details of the offence. That is, that on 3 July 2000 outside the TAB agency in Surry Hills the applicant had robbed a staff member of the agency of a briefcase containing some $7,926 cash, being the property of the New South Wales TAB. His Honour recounted the applicant's evidence. The explanation the applicant gave in essence was that he became seriously concerned that other persons present in the vicinity might rob the TAB staff member and in order to obviate that robbery and to ensure her safety, he robbed her himself and that he, with a pair of pliers, cut the briefcase chained to her wrist, ran to his car and left. It is not surprising that the trial judge rejected the applicant's account, particularly because in the record of interview conducted within hours of the robbery there was not one word of any of that put by way of explanation. 
      
       
     5 The victim's account was set out by the trial judge in the remarks on sentence. It is not necessary for me to deal with that for the purposes of this judgment in great detail. However, her account in short summary was that the applicant referred to the presence of other persons waiting, flashed a badge and said ""go back to the TAB"" and talked of a possible robbery. She was shown a Federal Police badge and during the showing of that he pushed her, she pushed him back, he demanded that she remove the strap from her arm, there was some degree of discussion, another man attended and with pliers the chain was broken from her wrist. The alarm in the brief case went off and the smoke dye bomb also therein exploded. 
      
       
     6 The applicant had informed the trial judge of his drug habit and that he had been using heroin. He expressed a desire to achieve rehabilitation. A pre-sentence report was before his Honour and noted by the trial judge. In that report his Honour noted that although the offender had cited reasons for avoiding heroin and commencing a methadone program, his stated intention to remain drug-free lacked conviction. His commitment to change had yet to be determined. 
      
       
     7 His Honour was left, by the applicant's account in the witness box, with grave misgivings as to the applicant's insight into his position.  
      
       
     8 The applicant was noted by his Honour as being 24 years of age and his Honour was informed that he had attended the Salvation Army for assessment and that he had some support from his family. His Honour particularly had regard to the Bridge Programme for the Salvation Army in relation to the rehabilitation period after parole. His Honour concluded, weighing all the matters up - the age of the applicant, the principle that a sentence must not crush and also the fact that this will be the first time the applicant has been in gaol - that a starting point for the head sentence should be selected as at four years. To that his Honour applied a 15% discount in respect of the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. 
      
       
     9 In addition, however, his Honour referred to statistics taken from the Judicial Information system in relation to offences of robbery derived in relation to particular parameters. I shall return to that matter shortly. 
      
       
     10 His Honour also remarked that the Court of Criminal Appeal had recently delivered a guideline judgment in the matter of Regina v. Henry & Ors (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. His Honour, in reference to that guideline judgment, pointed out that the Chief Justice had indicated a commencing point of four to five years as a head sentence in respect of the offence of robbery where it involved a young offender with no prior convictions. Also, that the Chief Justice referred to elements of planning, the impact upon the victim or victims, the presence of a record and his Honour said:- 
      
       
        
         
         "" ... and it seems to me that in several respects the  
         Henry 
          judgment therefore applies to the circumstances here under consideration."" 
         
        
       
     11 Earlier, after referring to the recent delivery of the guideline judgment in Henry (supra), his Honour correctly referred to the maximum statutory penalty for the offence to which this offender had pleaded as that of 14 years. 
      
       
     12 In Henry (supra), the court was concerned to consider those crimes provided for by s.97 of the Crimes Act 1900; that is, the crime of armed robbery which is punishable by a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment. The point has been made amongst the criticisms of his Honour's sentence on this application that applying the guideline judgment and, in particular, the starting point of four years referred to by the Chief Justice in this context, proceeded on a misapprehension of the application of Henry (supra) in the given circumstances. 
      
       
     13 On my reading of what the trial judge said, however, although his Honour had omitted the word ""armed"" before the word ""robbery"" in his reference to the commencing point, it appears that what his Honour has sought to do is to examine the relevant considerations applicable to offences of armed robbery and also to robbery as might be applicable in a given case. It does not seem that his Honour extracted from what had been said by the Chief Justice in Henry (supra) a proposition that he should commence his reasoning in this case with a starting point sentence of four to five years. It does seem that he had regard to those matters referred to in Henry (supra) which a court might appropriately take into consideration, both in respect of the offence of armed robbery and the offence of robbery. His Honour noted also the matter of aggravation that the applicant was on a bond from the Local Court for theft and fraud at the time he had committed these offences. 
      
       
     14 It was contended that his Honour, when he adverted to the statistics from the Judicial Commission, to which I have already referred, selected the wrong parameters for obtaining the relevant statistics and selected statistics as appropriate to offences of robbery committed whilst on probation or parole at the time of the offence rather than the statistics for robbery committed whilst on bail or bond at the time of the offence. 
      
       
     15 We have been provided with print-outs of the statistics in each case. The numbers in each case are small. The range in the case of the probation and parole parameter is wider. That is to say, there are sentences at the upper end of the range, in particular in two matters. The sentences for offences committed whilst on bail and bond also include some proportion of the sentences at a lower range, although the bulk of the sentences in each case falls within approximately the same range. 
      
       
     16 The submission that has now been mounted is, because of this statistical phenomenon, his Honour selected a range of sentence which affected his deliberations such as to increase the penalty above what would have been appropriate had it been appropriate to reason from these statistics to the ultimate result. Such an approach of reasoning from the statistics to an ultimate result would, if it amounted to a consideration of the statistics unaccompanied by considerations of the particular considerations in the case, have been infected with grave error. I do not apprehend that that is what his Honour did. 
      
       
     17 He specifically had regard to all the matters that he had referred to, in particular age, the principle that a sentence must not crush, the fact it would be the first time in gaol, and expressed those considerations as having a particular bearing upon the sentence starting point of four years that he expressly concluded was appropriate. 
      
       
     18 I do not see that the criticisms are borne out. It may be that his Honour's reasons might be infelicitous in dealing with the expression of the two topics to which I have referred. However, the task with which the court is now concerned is to look at the sentence which his Honour passed and consider whether some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed in consequence of his Honour erring by misapplication of principle or in the result to such an extent that the sentence passed is manifestly excessive. 
      
       
     19 Defects in language or in reasoning that do not lead to the consequence that the sentence must be set aside having regard to those considerations do not found a basis on which the court can interfere at all under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
      
       
     20 In my view, having regard to the various matters by way of criticism and the sentence that his Honour passed, particularly having regard to the objective criminality of the offender's conduct on the day, I am unable to conclude that the sentence is outside the permissible legal range of sentences that a trial judge might pass in the circumstances. It follows that I would conclude that his Honour did not fall into error in the sentence he passed. 
      
       
     21 An additional criticism was advanced that his Honour had erred in failing to find special circumstances and had erred in failing thereby to vary the statutory proportion. I have said sufficient to show that his Honour had regard to the existence in the evidence of matters which might have been regarded by him as special circumstances and that he found specific matters that could be treated as special circumstances to have existed. His Honour said:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""Having considered all of the matters, I am unable to conclude that there are special circumstances that should vary the statutory ratio."" 
         
        
       
     22 His Honour referred to the relationship the non-parole period and parole period might bear in the context of the time for rehabilitation for the applicant to complete the Bridge Programme if he was serious in his intention to undertake it. His Honour concluded that the time the statutory proportion would provide for a parole period was sufficient to achieve that effect in the context of the particular circumstances of the applicant. 
      
       
     23 I do not see that his Honour has erred in any way in that regard. This Court sits to correct legal error, not to present its own individual views as to what might have been done at first instance. It was open to his Honour to find special circumstances. It was open to his Honour to decline to find special circumstances. I do not see that his declining to find special circumstances founds any basis on which the applicant might succeed in this application. 
      
       
     24 I would propose that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed. 
      
       
     25 BELL, J: I agree with the orders proposed by Greg James, J. for the reasons his Honour gave. 
      
       
     26 GREG JAMES, J: The orders will be as I have proposed.

      REGINA v Juan Carlos GALLI 
      
      
       
       Facts 
       
       
       The Appellant was convicted by a jury of having sexual intercourse with Hannah Lucy Sodersten without her consent in contravention of s61J of the  
       Crimes Act 
        1900. The circumstances of aggravation were that Ms Sodersten had a serious intellectual disability and was under the care of the Appellant who worked at the house where Ms Sodersten lived.  
        
        
       The Appellant was sentenced by his Honour Acting Judge Stewart to imprisonment for seven years, with a non-parole period of five years and three months, the sentence commencing on 6 July 2000. 
        
        
       The Crown case was circumstantial. One aspect of the Crown’s case on which it placed particular reliance was evidence of DNA testing carried out by Mr Goetz, a forensic biologist. The Appellant submitted that the trial miscarried because references to the DNA evidence in a record of interview were improperly admitted into evidence. The Appellant also submitted that his Honour failed to give adequate directions to the jury and erred in the ones he did give. Leave to appeal against sentence was also sought. The Crown submitted that even if errors had occurred, a conviction was inevitable and that the proviso in s6(1) of the  
       Criminal Appeal Act 
        1912 should be applied. 
        
        
       Held 
        
       Per Spigelman CJ, Sully and Adams JJ agreeing 
        
        
       A Inadmissible evidence 
        
       1 The references in the second of the Appellant’s records of interview to the Relative Chance of Paternity were inadmissible.  
       R v Taylor 
        (NSWCCA, 18 April 1995, unreported),  
       R v GK 
        [2001] NSWCCA 413 referred to. Although at the trial no objection was taken to this evidence going before the jury, leave under Rule 4 should be granted. 
        
        
       B Directions to the Jury 
        
       i Use to be made of the DNA evidence 
        
       2 It would have been desirable for the trial judge to direct the jury concerning the approach to be taken the statistics involved in the DNA evidence.  
       R v Duke 
        (1979) 1 ACrimR 39,  
       R v Milat 
        (1996) 87 ACrimR 446 referred to. However, the failure to do so in the case was not an error of law and did not constitute a miscarriage of justice. 
        
        
       3 His Honour did not commit the “Prosecutor’s Fallacy”. However, in the circumstances of this case, it would have been desirable for the trial judge to have warned the jury about the impermissibility of this line of reasoning.  
       R v GK 
        (supra) referred to. 
        
        
       4 His Honour erred in referring to the Relative Chance of Paternity in his summing-up. No such evidence of Mr Goetz was before the jury and, in any case, such evidence was inadmissible.  
        R v GK 
        (supra) referred to.  
        
        
        
       ii Circumstantial evidence 
        
       5 His Honour referred to the Crown’s onus on a number of occasions in the summing-up. There was no reversal of that onus suggested by his Honour in his directions regarding circumstantial evidence. 
        
        
       C Application of the proviso 
        
       6 The errors committed at the trial were not of so fundamental a character as to lead to the conclusion that there was hardly a trial at all.

        (1988) 164 CLR 365,  
       Glennon v The Queen

       Green v The Queen 
        (1996-1997) 191 CLR 334 referred to. 
        
        
       7 In the circumstances of the present case, the number of persons who could have committed the crime was restricted to an exceptionally unusual degree. Given the force of the unchallenged evidence regarding the Paternity Index a conviction was inevitable and it cannot be said that the Appellant lost a chance of acquittal. The proviso should be applied.

       D Sentence 
        
       8 The sentence was within the range which his Honour could legitimately impose. There was no error which could justify the intervention of this Court.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
     1 SPIGELMAN CJ: The Appellant was indicted before his Honour Acting Judge Stewart on a charge against s61J of the Crimes Act 1900, that between 3 April 1998 and 18 April 1998, at Eleanora Heights, he had sexual intercourse with Hannah Lucy Sodersten without her consent. The circumstances of aggravation were that at the time of the alleged offence, Ms Sodersten had a serious intellectual disability and was under the care of the Appellant who worked at the house where Ms Sodersten was confined.  
      
       
     2 The Appellant pleaded not guilty and was tried before his Honour and a jury. On 6 July 2000 the jury returned with a verdict of guilty. On 25 August 2000, the Appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for seven years, with a non-parole period of five years and three months, the sentence commencing on 6 July 2000. 
      
       
     3 At the time of the commission of the offence, Ms Sodersten was 26 years old and a resident of a group home operated by the Department of Community Services (“DOCS”) at Elanora Heights. The Appellant was employed by DOCS as a carer at the home. Ms Sodersten was one of four people in the group home for whose care the Appellant had responsibility. The nature of Ms Sodersten’s disability is such that she cannot speak or make signs to communicate in any meaningful way. 
      
       
     4 The evidence given by Dr Edwards for the Crown was that there had been penile penetration of Ms Sodersten as a result of which she fell pregnant during the period between 3 April 1998 and 18 April 1998. The fact that Ms Sodersten had had sexual intercourse was only confirmed on 29 May 1998, after it was found that she was nine weeks pregnant. Subsequently, the foetus was aborted. Ms Sodersten was never able to identify who was responsible for the act of sexual intercourse, nor could she give evidence in relation to that issue at the trial. 
      
       
     5 The Appellant started working at the home on a permanent basis in April 1993. Part of his duties required him to administer medication to the residents. Ms Sodersten had been on the contraceptive pill and the Appellant had administered that to her. He was aware that she ceased taking the pill at the end of 1997. The Appellant also was aware that she menstruated, as he changed her nappies.  
      
       
     6 The Appellant voluntarily gave blood samples and participated in two records of interview. No admission was made by him. The Crown case was entirely circumstantial. The first aspect of the Crown’s case was the opportunity for the Appellant to have intercourse with Ms Sodersten. The allegation was that the Appellant was one of three men employed by DOCS who had access to Ms Sodersten in the relevant time period. The Appellant did not challenge this and, in fact, gave evidence that he was on night duty during the relevant period in the home, alone with the victim and other residents. 
      
       
     7 The second aspect of the Crown’s case was the evidence given by Mr Goetz, a forensic biologist, who referred to the DNA testing carried out on the blood sample given by the Appellant and the two other male employees of DOCS, Mr Phillips and Mr Burcell, who had access to the victim over the relevant period. These samples were compared with a DNA analysis of Ms Sodersten’s blood and a DNA analysis of the foetal tissue. Mr Goetz gave evidence that the tests eliminated Mr Phillips and Mr Burcell as possible biological fathers of the foetus carried by Ms Sodersten, but established the Appellant as a possible father. Further tests were conducted. According to Mr Goetz, it was 2.4 million times more likely that the Appellant was the father, rather than a person taken at random from the community. 
      
       
     8 No blood sample was taken from the two male patients (one now deceased) who lived with Ms Sodersten in the house. One patient suffered cerebral palsy, was profoundly intellectually disabled and was confined to a wheelchair. The other had Down’s syndrome, was profoundly intellectually disabled and was blind. The house was staffed on a 24 hour basis. The patients were subject to close supervision, both at night and during the day. The bottom half of the doors of the two male resident patients were locked at night. 
      
       
     9 There was no issue as to consent. It was uncontested that the victim was intellectually disabled and did not have the capacity to consent. The Appellant defended the case on a limited basis founded on three issues. The first was the assertion by the Appellant of his innocence. The Appellant said that he volunteered to give blood samples because he had “had nothing to hide” and was confident that the tests would eliminate him as a possible offender. The second concerned the possibility of “statistical error” in relation to the evidence of DNA matching undertaken by Mr Goetz. The third matter relied on by the Appellant was an assertion of good character, conceded by the informant. A number of people were called to give positive character evidence for the Appellant. 
      
       
        
       The DNA Evidence 
       
     10 DNA tests were conducted by Mr Robert Goetz, the officer in charge of the Forensic Biology Laboratory in the Division of Analytical Laboratories of the Institute of Clinical Pathology and Medical Research. He prepared two reports dated 19 October 1998 and 16 November 1998. He gave evidence at the trial, first on a voir dire and, after his Honour determined that the evidence was admissible, he gave evidence before the jury. 
      
       
     11 In his first report, Mr Goetz said that DNA testing had been carried out on blood from the victim and from the foetus on the one hand, and each of the Appellant and the other two employees, Keith Phillips and Ian Burrell, on the other hand. The report was a three-page document of which the third page was an annexure indicating the results of the tests in tabular form. The first two pages was the written report which, relevantly, contained the following passage: 
      
       
        
         
         “The results show that Keith PHILLIPS or Ian BURRELL cannot be the father of the foetus. 
         
        
        
         
         The results show that Juan GALLI could be the biological father of the foetus. Statistical analysis of the results shows the following: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Paternity Index 172:1 
            
           Relative Chance of Paternity 99.4% 
            
           Relative Chance of Non-Paternity 0.6%”. 
           
          
         
        
       
     12 It is significant to note that only the table outlining the results of the tests was tendered before the jury. The report quoted above was not tendered before the jury. Mr Goetz, however, gave oral evidence before the jury explaining the results in the table to the effect which I will outline below. 
      
       
     13 The second report by Mr Goetz provided further information of comparison between the samples from the victim and foetus with the blood of the Appellant. The results were set out in a table. The report to which the table was annexed concluded: 
      
       
        
         
         “The results show that Juan GALLI could be the biological father of the foetus. Statistical analysis of the results shows the following: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Paternity Index = 14330:1 
            
           Relative Chance of Paternity = greater than 99.99% 
            
           Relative Chance of Non-Paternity = less than 0.01% 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         When these results are combined with those in my previous report (dated 19.10.98) the statistics are as follows: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Paternity Index = 2,400,000:1 
            
           Relative Chance of Paternity = greater than 99.9999% 
            
           Relative Chance of Non-Paternity = less than 0.00001%.” 
           
          
         
        
       
     14 As with the previous report, it was only the table that went to the jury, not the report. However, the reports were used by the police in a record of interview that was before the jury. 
      
       
     15 The Appellant consented to two recorded records of interview, the first on 9 June 1998 and the second on 25 November 1998. He made no admissions and maintained his innocence. During the course of the second ERISP the two reports from Mr Goetz - that were not tendered - were put to him in terms and he was asked to comment on them. This ERISP was played at the trial to the jury immediately before the closing of the Crown case.  
      
       
     16 The following questions by the police and the Appellant’s answers appear in the transcript of the video which was supplied to the Court: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q30 Yes, just where it says, The results show. 
         
        
        
         
         A And ah, the second one, the second line? 
         
        
        
         
         Q31 Yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         A The results show that Keith Phillips or Ian Burrell cannot be the father of the foetus. 
         
        
        
         
         Q32 And can you just read the - - - 
         
        
        
         
         A The results show that Juan Galli could be the biological father of the foetus ….. sorry my reading, analysis of the results show the following. 
         
        
        
         
         Q33 And can you tell me what those results show? 
         
        
        
         
         A Which one, that from the top - - - 
         
        
        
         
         Q34 Yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         A - - - or I don’t understand what ….. 
         
        
        
         
         Q35 ….. I’ll just tell you on this third page. This is showing that you could be the biological father - - - 
         
        
        
         
         A Ah hmm. 
         
        
        
         
         Q35 - - - of the foetus, and this is the statistics that show it. It says, The paternity index is a hundred and seventy two to one, which means you could be - - - 
         
        
        
         
         A Mmm. 
         
        
        
         
         Q35 - - - if there’s a hundred and seventy two people, then you could be one of those. 
         
        
        
         
         A Mmm. 
         
        
        
         
         Q36 And the relative chance of paternity is ninety nine point four per cent and the relative chance of non-paternity is nought point six per cent. 
         
        
        
         
         A ….. I don’t understand those numbers anyway. 
         
        
        
         
         Q37 O.K. I’ll just show you - - - 
         
        
        
         
         DETECTIVE SENIOR CONSTABLE HUNT 
         
        
        
         
         Q38 Should I explain those, what those statistics mean. 
         
        
        
         
         PLAINCLOTHES SENIOR CONSTABLE GILL 
         
        
        
         
         Q39 Well it’s saying, you understand that it shows that Keith Phillips and Ian Burrell cannot be the father. 
         
        
        
         
         A Well, it say so very clear in there, yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q40 And that there’s a chance that you can be the father. 
         
        
        
         
         A Yeah, mmm. 
         
        
        
         
         Q41 And it’s saying that ninety nine point four per cent, that’s - - - 
         
        
        
         
         A That I, that I could be the father. 
         
        
        
         
         Q41 - - - how much of a chance that you are the father. 
         
        
        
         
         A - - - that I could be the father of that child. 
         
        
        
         
         Q42 Yes, of Hannah’s child. 
         
        
        
         
         DETECTIVE SENIOR CONSTABLE HUNT 
         
        
        
         
         Q43 What do you say about that? 
         
        
        
         
         A Well, as I say before I’ve got nothing to do with it. I got nothing, nothing to do with it. 
         
        
        
         
         PLAINCLOTHES SENIOR CONSTABLE GILL 
         
        
        
         
         Q44 Sorry, and that as dated the 19th of the 10th,1998. There was some further tests done on your sample of blood alone. 
         
        
        
         
         A Ah hmm. 
         
        
        
         
         Q45 And this is the second test results. I’ll just read it for you. I says the results show that Juan Galli could be the biological father of the foetus. Statistical analysis of the results show the following: The paternity index says that in fourteen thousand three hundred and thirty people, that you could be one of those. So the results have gone up higher. 
         
        
        
         
         A Mmm. 
         
        
        
         
         Q46 So there’s an even bigger chance now that you are the father. Do you understand that. 
         
        
        
         
         A (NO AUDIBLE REPLY) 
         
        
        
         
         Q47 It’s also saying the relative chance of paternity is greater than ninety nine point ninety nine percent. So there’s less than nought point nought one per cent that you aren’t the father. It also goes on to show the paternity index, sorry, then they were done again - - - 
         
        
        
         
         A Yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         Q48 - - - these are combined with these ones over here. That you were the only one in two million, four hundred thousand - - - 
         
        
        
         
         A Ah hmm. 
         
        
        
         
         Q49 - - - that you could be the father. And it shows that ninety nine point nine nine nine per cent of chance that you are the paternal father. 
         
        
        
         
         DETECTIVE SENIOR CONSTABLE HUNT 
         
        
        
         
         Q50 [It] says, Greater than. 
         
        
        
         
         PLAINCLOTHES SENIOR CONSTABLE GILL 
         
        
        
         
         Q51 And there is less than nought point nought nought nought one per cent that you aren’t the father. What can you, have you got anything to say about these results? 
         
        
        
         
         A ….. there’s got to be something wrong. I haven’t, as I said, I haven’t done anything to her, nothing at all, I’ve been, as I said, I, I’ve been with them for over six, six years with her. 
         
        
        
         
         Q52 And - - - 
         
        
        
         
         A Never dream of or thought of doing anything to her. 
         
        
        
        … 
        
        
         
         PLAINCLOTHES SENIOR CONSTABLE GILL 
         
        
        
         
         Q69 Is there anything else you wish to say about this matter, Carlos? 
         
        
        
         
         A Well, I would say it again and over and over again, I got nothing to do with her pregnancy. I’m not that kind of person to, or take advantage of anyone. So that’s all I got, I got to say. I’ve got nothing to do with her pregnancy. What, and the tests, what the tests are shown it look like I, I am the one, but I say there’s got to be something wrong in there. I haven’t done anything to her. 
         
        
        
         
         Q70 So you see there’s no other reason for the results showing that you are the father. Can you think of any reason? 
         
        
        
         
         A Well, it’s got to be something wrong in there.” 
         
        
       
     17 This video containing these questions and answers was played to the jury immediately before the closing of the Crown case. 
      
       
     18 As I have indicated above, Mr Goetz gave evidence on a voir dire. It is not necessary to set out the whole of the evidence given. It is sufficient to note that in some respects Mr Goetz made observations during the course of the voir dire which he did not repeat before the jury.  
      
       
     19 When the Crown Prosecutor tendered the table annexed to the second report, it was tendered even on the voir dire as a one-page document, without the covering report. However, in the course of the voir dire the following evidence was given: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q It is the combination of these two lots of results referring to your paternity index that you then establish the probability of 99.9999 per cent, is that right? 
         
        
        
         
         A That’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: That’s not shown here though, is it? 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: No your Honour, I haven’t tendered that in the documentation.” 
         
        
       
     20 Subsequently, in the course of cross-examination on the voir dire the following occurred: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q So what it comes down to at the end of the day is you are saying in terms of the probabilities the real question that you are answering is what is the chance of taking somebody from the population at large and having them match this particular combination of alleles? 
         
        
        
         
         A That’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q That’s not the same thing as saying that it’s 99.9999 per cent certain that Mr Galli is the father, is it? 
         
        
        
         
         A No, that’s not what I’m saying, I am saying the relative chance of paternity is 99.999 per cent, I am not saying that he is 99.999 per cent likely to be the father. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: What does the relative chance of paternity mean though? 
         
        
        
         
         A It’s just another way of re-wording the probability of paternity, the paternity index. If I had a paternity index of 100 to 1 that would be a relative chance of paternity of 99 per cent. It’s just another way of rewording it, it really flows very much from the Family Law Act which specifies the way they want the reporting done and that is the way they want the reporting done in that case. 
         
        
        
         
         Q This isn’t a Family Law Court, this is a criminal court and the Crown has an obligation if it is to prove the case against this accused of proving it beyond reasonable doubt. Can you equate that in any way to this probability of paternity test. 
         
        
        
         
         A No I prefer actually to use the paternity index, the 100 to 1 or 1000 to 1 or 2.4 million to 1 rather than the relative chance of paternity. I think that can sometimes be a bit misleading.” 
         
        
       
     21 The reference to the relative chance of paternity and the figure of 99.9999 per cent during the course of the voir dire was not repeated in the evidence given by Mr Goetz before the jury. This may have been because of Mr Goetz’s opinion that it could be misleading. 
      
       
     22 In his evidence before the jury Mr Goetz said: 
      
       
        
         
         “… the quality of the DNA was very good. As a forensic biologist we’re used to dealing with samples that are extremely degraded, samples that have been outside in the sun for weeks if not months, samples that are minute, samples the size of pinheads. In this case the blood samples, I had a number of mls of blood and with the foetus I had a sample that was of extremely good quality. There was no problem getting the DNA in sufficient quantities from all the samples I analysed.” 
          
         
        
       
     23 Mr Goetz gave evidence to the jury about the nature of DNA and the conduct of tests for DNA. He gave evidence about testing for paternity by identifying the DNA of the mother and of the foetus, which could then identify what the foetus would have inherited from the father. 
      
       
     24 The two tables of results, being the annexures to Mr Goetz’s reports of 19 October and 16 November 1998, were identified and tendered. As noted above, the covering reports were not tendered. 
      
       
     25 Mr Goetz referred to the first table of results of DNA testing, being the table attached to his report of 19 October 1998. He told he jury: 
      
       
        
         
         “From my testing I could exclude Keith Phillips and Ian Burrell from paternity so they could not be the father of the foetus, however, I was unable to exclude Juan Galli from paternity.” 
         
        
       
     26 Mr Goetz referred to the second table, being that annexed to his report of 16 November 1998 as containing the results of further DNA testing of samples of the blood from the victim, the foetus and the Appellant. 
      
       
     27 Mr Goetz explained to the jury that the columns of the tables comprised different DNA markers. He noted the presence of particular alleles in the foetus which were not present in the blood sample from the mother. They must have come from the father. He explained that the absence of such alleles in the case of both Mr Phillips and Mr Burrell enabled him to exclude them as possible fathers. The presence of the alleles in the case of the Appellant enabled him to state that the Appellant could be the biological father. 
      
       
     28 With respect to each DNA marker referred to in each column of the tables, the last line item in each column was a computation of a “Paternity Index”. Mr Goetz explained this to the jury as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “Paternity Index is a calculation that is made where I have not been able to exclude someone. If I can’t exclude him, exclude the possible father I need to know the significance of the inclusions. What is the probability that Mr Galli could be the biological father as compared to anybody else taken at random in the population. And to do that I take two hypothesis (sic) to calculate my paternity index. My first hypothesis is what is the likelihood that Juan Galli is the biological father and my second hypothesis is what is the likelihood that Juan Galli is not the biological father but someone else taken at random in the population is.” 
         
        
       
     29 Mr Goetz then explained the significance of the figures in the table with respect to the issue of whether the Appellant was the father. He indicated that the paternity index for each DNA marker was based on the combination of the probability that he would have passed on the relevant allele to the foetus and the frequency of the occurrence of that particular allele in the general population, based on a specific database.  
      
       
     30 He also gave the following evidence: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q As a combination of each of those paternity indexes for each particular DNA marker, at that point in time did you come to a combined total paternity index at that stage? 
         
        
        
         
         A Yes I did. 
         
        
        
         
         Q What was the result of that combined paternity index? 
         
        
        
         
         A The combined paternity index is calculated by multiplying those numbers at the bottom together, the bottom of that column, bottom of that table together. If you multiply all those numbers together and you come up with a combined paternity index of 172 to 1. So using the 10 different DNA markers in that table, it’s 172 times more likely that Juan Galli is the father of the foetus than anybody else taken at random from the population.” 
         
        
       
     31 Mr Goetz went on to explain the further testing that he had done to generate he second table, with the application of the Profiler Plus system. He said that he had looked at each marker for both the foetus and the mother and then by deduction identified what was passed on to the foetus by its biological father. He testified that in each of nine DNA markers, the Appellant possessed the allele which was inherited by the foetus from its father. Mr Goetz calculated the paternity index for each of these markers. He then gave the following evidence to the jury: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q In regard to this further testing, did you come to a further refined paternity index? 
         
        
        
         
         A Using the profiler plus system, the combined paternity index was 14,330 to 1. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Q What does that mean? 
         
        
        
         
         A Using profiler plus alone Mr Galli is 14,330 times more likely to be the father of the foetus than anybody else taken at random in the population. 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q So the results of the first tests were, you told us, a 172 times more likely Mr Galli was the father of the foetus than a person taken at random from the population. 
         
        
        
         
         A That’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q In regard to the second test the figure is Mr Galli was 14,330 times more likely to be the father than a person taken at random from the general population? 
         
        
        
         
         A That’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q Because these are different DNA markers and different indicators are you able to then combine those results? 
         
        
        
         
         A Yes I am. 
         
        
        
         
         Q Once you combine those results from a total of 18 DNA markers … what was your result there? 
         
        
        
         
         A The combined paternity index now is 2.4 million to 1 which means that Mr Galli is 2.4 million times more likely to be the biological father of the foetus than anybody else taken at random in the population.” 
         
        
        
       The Summing Up 
       
     32 In the course of his summing up, his Honour instructed the jury that the Crown case was based on circumstantial evidence. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Circumstantial evidence, members of the jury, is not necessarily any less reliable than direct evidence, such as the evidence of an eye witness. Indeed, in some cases, it can be more convincing. However, before you can find an accused person guilty of a crime on the basis of circumstantial evidence, you must be satisfied that such a finding is not only reasonable but that it is the only reasonable finding to make. 
         
        
        
         
         It follows that, if there is another finding which is reasonably open, that is, if there is another reasonable explanation which is consistent with innocence, it is your duty to find the accused not guilty, and, of course, when you consider circumstantial evidence, you do so in the light of all the other material in the case, including, of course, the material placed before you by the accused.” 
         
        
       
     33 With respect to the DNA evidence, his Honour instructed the jury: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Crown’s case is that he wasn’t the only male person who had access to her without anyone else who could talk about it being present. The other men are Phillips and Burrell. They were, according to Mr Goetz’s evidence, eliminated as possibilities by Mr Goetz’s first test, and the Crown puts it to you as part of the Crown’s case that they were, in fact, eliminated.” 
         
        
       
     34 His Honour outlined the expertise of Mr Goetz and his evidence about the way he conducted the tests and added: 
      
       
        
         
         “All three men who had the opportunity to be alone with Hannah Sodersten were tested. They all had blood samples taken. The Crown put to you that Mr Goetz conducted scientific tests. These tests were not done by flight-by nights. It is a recognised area of science and Mr Goetz told you about DNA.” 
         
        
       
     35 After referring to some of the detail of the expert evidence, his Honour continued: 
      
       
        
         
         “The very first marker excluded Phillips and Burrell. There was no 1.2 in their test. The accused had 1.2 so he was a possible says Mr Goetz. He had an allele that the foetus had and he concluded that there was a 172 to one likelihood he was the father, when compared with a likelihood of a person taken at random from the community having the same markers and allele as the accused. … 
         
        
        
         
         Now the Crown concedes that if that was where it ended it may well be that it would not be open to you to find beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was the father of that child., but Mr Goetz did not stop there, he went on to do further testing. He prepared charts or tables which are exhibit C and D. You will have them with you in the jury room. 
         
        
        
         
         The second chart, exhibit D, indicates that Mr Goetz told you, that eight further independent tests were taken. In each the accused possessed the same allele as the foetus. These additional tests showed that the chances of a person chosen at random from the community having the same as the accused had risen from 172 to one to 14,330 to one. That is that it was 14,330 times more likely that it was the accused than anyone taken at random from the community, and he told you that when you combined the two tests, it became 2,400,000 times more likely that it was the accused rather than someone taken at random from the community.” 
         
        
       
     36 His Honour also directed the jury: 
      
       
        
         
         “In Goetz’s view it is 2.4 million times more likely that it is the accused who is the father than a person taken at random from the community. He bases that, members of the jury, on this 99.9999 basis. You will remember him talking about, if it is only 95 per cent certain it goes down to 800,000 to one, but up to seven-odd million to one, and Mr Goetz takes the view, and it is his opinion and he expresses confidence in it, that the 2.4 million statistic is correct.” 
         
        
       
     37 There was no point in Mr Goetz’s evidence before the jury at which he used the figure of “99.9999 per cent”. The figure of 95% was used once in the course of his cross-examination. The cross-examination was directed to the issue of the validity of the data bases used for the purposes of computing the frequency of the occurrence of a particular DNA marker in the general population. The cross-examiner introduced the concept of “confidence levels” which Mr Goetz identified as a margin of error based upon the sampling size of the respective databases. The following passage appears in the cross-examination: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q Just in relation to these confidence levels you arrived at a figure which you have given in your evidence in chief without any reference to any confidence level? 
         
        
        
         
         A That’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q I understand though that in any statistical analysis that sort of figure presumably is simply a figure that falls within the range of confidence levels? 
         
        
        
         
         A That’s the middle range I have given you, I haven’t given you an up confidence level or a lower confidence level, it’s my best estimate. 
         
        
        
         
         Q What would your confidence levels be in relation to -- 
         
        
        
         
         A From my experience in dealing with hundreds and thousands of these calculations the 95 per cent confidence level which is the traditional one used usually drops the statistic usually one third one way and takes it up three times the other way. In other words, in this case you’d expect it to be approximately between 840,000 to 1 up to 7.2 million to 1. 
         
        
        
         
         Q Focusing as I want to do on the lower range, that’s 840,00 to 1? 
         
        
        
         
         A That’s correct.” 
         
        
       
     38 In his summing-up his Honour has referred to the “95 per cent confidence level” in terms of “95 per cent certain” His Honour also referred to Mr Goetz “basing” the 2.4 million to one figure “on this 99.9999 basis”, a figure Mr Goetz had not used before the jury. This figure had been mentioned only in the record of interview. 
      
       
        
       Grounds of Appeal 
       
     39 The Appellant has raised five grounds of appeal against his conviction. These are: 
      
       
        
         
         “1. The Appellant received an unfair trial in that the Crown led inadmissible evidence from the police as to the questioning of the Appellant regarding his explanation for the DNA results. 
         
        
        
         
         2. The trial judge failed to give a proper and/or adequate direction to the jury regarding circumstantial evidence as it related to the evidence of the DNA. 
         
        
        
         
         3. The trial judge erred in failing to re-direct the jury as to the use to be made by the jury of the evidence of the DNA. 
         
        
        
         
         4. The verdict cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         5. Generally, there has been a miscarriage of justice.” 
         
        
       
     40 The Appellant also sought leave to appeal from the sentence imposed on him. 
      
       
     41 Each of Grounds 1, 2 and 3 turn on the evidence relating to the DNA results, either in terms of inadmissibility (Ground 1) or defects in the trial judge’s directions (Grounds 2 and 3). It was not suggested that Grounds 4 and 5 have any basis independent of the earlier grounds. 
      
       
     42 The evidence about the DNA results from Mr Goetz is of considerable force. The Crown submits that its case was of overwhelming strength. If appealable error has occurred, the Crown submits that the Court should apply the proviso in s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
      
       
        
       The Paternity Index 
       
     43 The admissibility of the figures in the Paternity Index was conceded by the Appellant in the present case. The use of such figures was expressly approved by this Court in R v GK [2001] NSWCCA 413 at [57] and [100]. The primary sample, sometimes referred to in the cases and literature as the “crime stain”, consisted of DNA tests of the foetus and of the mother from which was deduced the contribution to the foetus from the father. The use of such testing for the purposes of establishing paternity is well established. The computation and use of the paternity index is not subject to any challenge in the present case. 
      
       
     44 It is of central significance in the present case that the number of persons who could have had sexual intercourse with the victim was exceptionally limited. The particular circumstances of the victim were such that only three carers and two male patients were possible suspects. This is an unusually small number of suspects. Two of the suspects were themselves eliminated by DNA testing. The Appellant tested positive in all relevant respects. The other two suspects, being the two male patients, were not tested at all. On the basis of the figure of 2.4 million to one, there are three or four males in the Australian community who may have the DNA profile of the father as suggested by the DNA tests. The possibility that one of the other two or three men in Australia who may have the DNA profile suggested in the testing, would be one or other of the two patients, is so slight that the DNA testing carried particular force on the facts of the present case. 
      
       
     45 DNA test results identify information in the form of two alleles at each locus on the DNA strand that has been targeted. In the present case, at each of the loci targeted, there was an identity between the alleles inherited by the foetus from its biological father and those of the Appellant. The significance for the jury of this information depends upon scientific information which would not normally be known to a jury. It also depends on computation which a jury could not undertake. This is, accordingly, an appropriate subject matter for expert evidence.  
      
       
     46 The first level of expert evidence identifies a question of probability for the jury. With respect to each allele identified as existing in both the Appellant sample, and in the biological father: what is its frequency of occurrence in the general population? The more frequent is the occurrence, the less the coincidence points to the Appellant as the father. The degree to which this is so, however, is a matter on which a jury may require assistance. 
      
       
     47 A second level of expert evidence is also required in order to combine the results with respect to each allele in a manner which the jury could not do unassisted. There is a generally accepted scientific technique for combining the results to take into account, and to compute, the improbability of the co-existence in both the biological father and the Appellant of the number of different alleles that had been identified. A computation is required in order to explain the combined effect of the co-existence of all the alleles. 
      
       
     48 Unless evidence can be given in a numerical form, a jury is unlikely to appreciate the probative value of the DNA tests. As Callaway JA said in R v Noll [1999] 3 VR 704 at 708-709: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is the statistical step in the reasoning that gives DNA evidence its probative value.” 
         
        
       
     49 Where, as here, there is a well-established and widely recognised scientific basis for conducting the relevant computations, it is appropriate that the jury be assisted in this manner.  
      
       
     50 The danger in evidence of this character is that its very precision and concreteness suggests an exactness which a statistical distribution does not have. There will be circumstances in which this may mislead the jury and lead it to give the evidence greater weight than it ought be given.  
      
       
     51 As King CJ put it in R v Duke (1979) 1 ACrimR 39 at 41: 
      
       
        
         
         “There may be unusual cases in which the judge has reason to fear that the jury will be overawed by the scientific garb in which the evidence is presented and will attach greater weight to it than it is capable of bearing.“ 
         
        
       
     52 The Appellant submitted that in this case it was essential that directions should have been given by his Honour to “balance the concreteness of the scientific evidence offered by the Crown”. Neither before his Honour nor in this Court, was the nature of the direction that ought to have been given in this regard specified. The one “fact” that could balance the “concreteness” of the evidence was that on the figures themselves there were three or four persons in Australia who may have shared this DNA profile. I do not see that a direction of that character would have been of substantial assistance to the Appellant. His Honour fully summarised he submissions made for the Appellant at the trial. 
      
       
     53 In R v Milat (1996) 87 ACrimR 446 Hunt CJ at CL said at 452: 
      
       
        
         
         “The jury in every DNA case should, of course, be directed not to approach the issue of chance upon any strictly mathematical basis.” 
         
        
       
     54 Counsel for the Appellant submitted that a direction of that character was required in this case.  
      
       
     55 It may be desirable to warn a jury in this way as a general rule, in order to balance the concreteness and precision of the statistical calculations. Findings of fact in both civil and criminal cases require commonsense judgment and the tribunal of fact is required to reach a level of actual persuasion on the whole of the evidence. This does not involve a mechanical application of probabilities. (See the authorities collected in Seltsam Pty Ltd v McGuiness (2000) 49 NSWLR 262 at [136]. See also GK (supra) at [21]-[22]; the Honourable Justice D Hodgson “A Lawyer Looks at Bayes’ Theorem” Australian Law Journal forthcoming and R v Adams [1996] 2 CrAppR 467 at 481 per Rose LJ.) 
      
       
     56 Where, as here, the mathematical computations were stark, and evidence capable of counterbalancing the numbers was limited, it would have been desirable for the trial judge to indicate to the jury that the task before them was not one capable of being reduced to a mathematical computation. However, in view of the limited range of issues in dispute, I do not believe his Honour’s failure to give such a direction was an error of law or constituted a miscarriage of justice. The case for the Appellant including his denials on oath, his expectation that DNA testing would clear him and the strong character evidence were all emphasised in the summing-up. Leave is required under Rule 4. The matter is not, in the circumstances, of sufficient significance to justify leave. 
      
       
     57 The Appellant submitted that the trial judge had, in substance, reversed the onus of proof in his directions on circumstantial evidence. This direction is fully set out above. Immediately after giving the jury the direction that they must be satisfied that the finding of guilt on circumstantial evidence must be “the only reasonable finding to make”, his Honour went on to say “if there is another finding which is reasonably open, that is if there is another reasonable explanation which is consistent with innocence, it is your duty to find the accused not guilty”. 
      
       
     58 The Appellant submitted that the reference to “another reasonable explanation” carried the suggestion that it was a matter for the Appellant to adduce evidence capable of constituting such an “explanation”. This submission should be rejected. 
      
       
     59 His Honour referred on a number of occasions to the onus that the Crown had and, on more than one occasion, emphasised that the Appellant had no onus of any character and was not obliged to give evidence, although he had done so. I do not believe in this context that a suggestion of a shift in the onus can reasonably be inferred. All that his Honour was doing, in the passage to which the Court’s attention was directed, was to state in the obverse the primary proposition on which he directed the jury, that they had to be satisfied, in the context of a circumstantial case, that the finding of guilt was “the only reasonable finding to make”. 
      
       
     60 The Appellant did not rely on a failure by the trial judge to expressly direct attention to the fact that the two male patients had not been tested. Although there was evidence indicating a lack of opportunity and physical difficulty for any suggestion that one or other of those patients could be responsible for the pregnancy, nevertheless the evidence was not such as to remove any reasonable possibility, as distinct from probability, that one of them could have been responsible.  
      
       
     61 In his directions to the jury his Honour did not identify either of the fellow patients as even a possibility. Indeed, in his directions to the jury he dismissed them as possibilities, no doubt by reason of the way the case had been run before him.  
      
       
     62 In his summing-up his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Crown puts it to you, as part of its case, that we are not talking about a stranger here, we are talking about somebody who knew Hannah Sodersten and  
         who had unsupervised access to her.” 
          (Emphasis added) 
         
        
       
       
       The reference to “unsupervised access” is, in the circumstances, intended to exclude the two patients. 
        
       
     63 To similar effect was his Honour’s observation, in the context of outlining the evidence of Mr Goetz: 
      
       
        
         
         “All three men  
         who had the opportunity to be alone 
          with Hannah Sodersten were tested. They all had blood samples taken.” 
          (Emphasis added) 
         
        
       
       
       Again the reference to “the opportunity to be alone” was directed to excluding the relevance of either of the other patients.  
        
       
     64 It does not appear that the defence submissions at trial made any reference to the possibility of one of the other patients being responsible. No doubt his Honour proceeded to make the remarks in the summing-up on this basis. 
      
       
     65 Similarly, in this Court the Appellant did not identify either of the references which I have italicised in pars [62] to [63] hereof as constituting a misdirection. It appears that the trial proceeded on the assumption that neither of the other patients was a real chance. No doubt that reflected the practical reality of the situation.  
      
       
     66 The Crown was not able to refer to evidence which would exclude the possibility of impregnation by one of the patients. There was evidence of supervision, but nothing to suggest that such supervision was infallible. There was evidence of physical separation and some degree of physical impossibility, e.g. the bottom half of each door being locked at night and one of the patients needing a wheelchair. Complete physical impossibility was not established. 
      
       
     67 This is a factor which I will keep in mind when considering the application of the proviso. 
      
       
        
       Relative Chance of Paternity Percentages 
       
     68 Since the trial in the present case, this Court has considered the admissibility of DNA evidence in R v GK (supra). In that case a trial judge had ruled that the Crown was entitled to lead evidence that DNA testing showed that the accused could be the father but that there should be no statistics put before the jury. The issue came before this Court pursuant to a question for determination under s5A(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Mr Goetz was one of two witnesses called by the Crown. The statistics in issue in that case were in the same form as Mr Goetz’s reports in the present case. There were statistics for each of a Paternity Index and for a Relative Chance of Paternity. This Court held in GK that the former were admissible but the latter were not admissible. The Crown does not challenge that finding and has proceeded to make submissions in the present case on the basis that statistics for a Relative Chance of Paternity are not admissible. 
      
       
     69 Mason P set out reasons for admitting the Paternity Index figures at [24] to [58]. He agreed at [60] with the reasons given by Sully J for excluding the Relative Chance of Paternity percentage, with one additional reason. Sully J also found that the Paternity Index figures should be admitted. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “[99] I am more ambivalent about the percentage quantifications of the Relative Chance of Paternity. Mr Goetz himself volunteered that he thought that the Paternity Index was the easier of the two statistical measures to understand, and I myself agree with that view. The bare percentage figures are so extraordinarily close to 100 per cent that there must be, at least, a real risk that jurors, even sensible jurors properly directed, would think that the difference between the percentage figures and 100 per cent was so miniscule that there could be no possibility that GK was not the father; when it is scientifically uncontroversial that the one thing that DNA testing cannot do is to exclude absolutely any possibility, however statistically trifling, to the contrary.” 
         
        
       
     70 Sully J indicated that he would have excluded these percentage figures on the basis of each of s135 and s137 of the Evidence Act: 
      
       
        
         
         “[100] … because of the combined effect of the considerations: 
         
        
        
         
         [1] that the residual risk of unfairness deriving from the subliminal impact of the raw percentage figures would have been, to me, both real and unacceptable; and 
         
        
        
         
         [2] that the admission of the Paternity Index figures would have given the Crown every fair opportunity of persuading the jury to accept the Crown contention that there was no real possibility that GK was not the father.” 
         
        
       
     71 Mason P at [60] added to this reasoning the consideration referred to by Mr Goetz in evidence in that case, that the relative chance of parentage percentage was more complicated to explain. 
      
       
     72 The Crown accepted the reasoning in GK. Specifically, the Crown accepted that such evidence was capable of being misleading or confusing within s135(b) of the Evidence Act 1995. The figures put to the Court in the present case by the Crown were that a Paternity Index of 50 to one would convert into a relative chance of paternity of about 98 percent. This was a submission, not based on expert evidence in the case. However, if a figure of 98 percent were put to a jury, it is likely that many jurors would regard that as very significant evidence pointing to the accused, even though the Paternity Index ratio was very low, so that numerous persons in the general community could share the DNA profile.  
      
       
     73 By accepting the authority of GK, the Crown conceded that that part of the record of interview in the present case which made reference to the percentage figure of the Relative Chance of Paternity was inadmissible.  
      
       
     74 I have quoted above the passage from the summing-up where the trial judge referred to the computation that the odds were 2.4 million to one times more likely that Mr Galli was the father than a person taken at random from the general population, as being put “on this 99.9999 basis”. Mr Goetz had given no such evidence before the jury, although he had on the voir dire. The only reference to “99.9999” percent was in the course of the record of interview. The Appellant relied upon this as a material misdirection. The Crown submitted that the reference in the trial judge’s summing-up was merely an “unfortunate lapse” and that it was “a quite fleeting reference” and “almost a throw-away line”. 
      
       
     75 There is nothing intrinsically wrong about a police officer putting before a suspect, evidence which suggests that the suspect’s account could not be true. (See e.g. Errey v The Queen [2001] WASCA 75 at [55].) Nevertheless, leading such evidence cannot be justified if the effect is to place inadmissible material before the jury. (See R v Taylor (NSWCCA, 18 April 1995, unreported) at p12.) That was the effect here. 
      
       
     76 No objection was taken to the admission of the record of interview. Counsel who appeared for the Appellant at the trial may well have taken the view that it was in the Appellant’s interests to have before the jury his client’s unhesitating denials when first confronted with the scientific evidence against him. No evidence from trial counsel was led in this Court. However, Counsel at trial did not have the benefit of the decision in GK. 
      
       
     77 Leave is required under Rule 4. I would grant leave because the result was to place significant inadmissible evidence before the jury. 
      
       
     78 By reason of his Honour’s admission of that part of the record of interview which referred to the percentage of the Relative Chance of Paternity, and also by reason of his Honour’s use of that percentage in his summing-up to the jury, Ground 1 and, in part, Ground 2 in the Notice of Appeal must be upheld. Subject to the application of the proviso, the Court should allow the appeal and order a new trial. In order to assess the application of the proviso, it is necessary to consider the other issues raised in the appeal. 
      
       
        
       The Prosecutor’s Fallacy 
       
     79 The evidence in the case and his Honour’s directions to the jury, were expressed in terms of the combined effect of the various DNA markers tested, to the affect that it was 2.4 million times more likely that it was the accused who was the father than a person taken at random from the community. It was submitted that his Honour had committed what has come to be known as the “Prosecutor’s Fallacy” in his directions to the jury. In my opinion this submission should be rejected. 
      
       
     80 The Prosecutor’s fallacy has been variously described. (See R v Dohney and Adams [1997] 1 CrAppR 369 at 372-3; Balding and Donnelly “The Prosecutor’s Fallacy in DNA Evidence” [1994] CrimLR 711 at 715 and 716).  
      
       
     81 The nature of the evidence given in the present case was an answer to a question in the following form: 
      
       
        
         
         “What was the probability of the accused having the … DNA of the father compared to a person taken at random?” 
         
        
       
     82 The answer to this question in this case was 2.4 million to one. 
      
       
     83 The question for the jury was: 
      
       
        
         
         “What was the probability of the accused being the father?” 
         
        
       
     84 One means of committing the Prosecutor’s Fallacy is a reasoning process which treats the answer to the first question as if it was an answer to the second question, i.e. that the probability that he was the father was 2.4 million to one. That is not a permissible form of reasoning.  
      
       
     85 Given the size of the male population in Australia, on the basis of a probability of 2.4 million to one, there would be three or four males in Australia who share the DNA profile of the father of the foetus. A statement in the form that the “odds are 2.4 million to 1 that the accused is the offender” or that the “odds are 1 in 2.4 million that the accused is innocent”, overlooks the number of people who could have committed the offence. 
      
       
     86 In terms of Bayes’ theorem, the argument forgets that there are “prior odds”, to which the likelihood ratio from the DNA tests must be applied, before computing the “posterior odds”. Although Bayes’ theorem is not appropriate to be applied to determine guilt or innocence (see references in par [55] above) it nevertheless represents a logical reasoning process. (See Evett et al “DNA profiling: A discussion of issues relating to the reporting of very small match probabilities” [2000] CrimLR 341 at 355.) The difficulty with its application is that most evidence in a criminal trial cannot be reduced to odds. 
      
       
     87 I have set out above the relevant extracts from his Honour’s summing-up. In my opinion, at no point in his summing-up did his Honour commit the Prosecutor’s Fallacy. Each of his references was in the form of the first question. This was a form approved in GK at [33]-[34]. 
      
       
     88 The Appellant also submitted that this was a case in which a warning to the jury against committing the Prosecutor’s Fallacy should have been given. In GK Mason P held that on the facts of that case it would have been appropriate to give a warning of this character. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “[59] It follows that the paternity index figures should not have been withheld from the jury pursuant to s137 of the  
         Evidence Act 
         . They should have gone to the jury accompanied by appropriate directions emphasising the need to avoid the prosecutor’s fallacy. The appeal is not the proper vehicle to formulate a model direction in that regard. I content myself with a suggestion that it would be desirable if, at the time the judge tells the jury that evidence of paternity has been expressed as a high or very high probability, the jury should be reminded then and there that the evaluation of that evidence is a matter for them in light of the totality of the expert and non-expert evidence.” 
         
        
       
     89 I do not understand Mason P to hold that a direction about the Prosecutor’s Fallacy is necessary in all cases in which DNA evidence is led. His Honour indicated that it was required in that case. Trial judges are already required to give numerous directions and it is by no means clear that in all circumstances a direction concerning the Prosecutor’s Fallacy would assist the jury. As McHugh J noted in KRM v The Queen (2001) 75 ALJR 550; [2001] HCA 11: 
      
       
        
         
         “[37] The more directions and warning juries are given the more likely it is that they will forget or misinterpret some directions or warnings.” 
         
        
       
     90 The question is whether or not in the circumstances of a particular case juries should be assisted by a warning not to engage in an impermissible form of reasoning. 
      
       
     91 In many cases a jury would be particularly assisted by a direction as to the use of probability by means of examples that are more likely to be within their own experience. Such a direction would usually avoid the need for an express warning against one particular kind of impermissible reasoning. 
      
       
     92 A good example of this kind of assistance is to be found in a direction to the jury in the earlier years of fingerprint evidence, when the issues raised were similar to those that have been raised in recent times with respect to DNA evidence. In R v Krausch (1913) 32 NZLR 1229, Chapman J summed-up to the jury in the following manner at 1230-1231: 
      
       
        
         
         “In comparing prints of two individuals you may chance to find a close agreement as to a particular point, but the whole weight of scientific testimony shows that even this is rare. If the chances are five to one against this – and they are said to be much more than five – then when you come to half a dozen such points what may in popular language be termed the odds against two being alike have gone up with great rapidity, and beyond this go up with enormous strides. I need not take you into arithmetic: I prefer to ask you to deal with the matter as you would deal with any other question of probability that arises in daily life. Take, for instance, this set of facts which came before this Court in a country town some years ago. A little girl had made a complaint against a man of having interfered with her. She had described him to the police, and on the following day the accused was pointed out by her and arrested. He produced family witnesses who tried to prove that he was somewhere else at the date of the occurrence. He was a tall, elderly man who wore a grey suit. The girl stated that he had taken a penny from a yellow purse with a brown lining, and had offered it to her. When she refused this he produced a mouth-trumpet from his pocket and offered her that. When arrested the accused had a grey suit on; in one pocket was a brown purse of a common type with a yellow lining, and in another a mouth-trumpet. I pointed out to the jury that there were, so to speak, five marks of identification besides the girl’s general recognition – namely, (1) a tall man, (2) elderly, (3) with a grey suit, (4) with a purse showing those two colours not described with absolute accuracy, and (5) a mouth-trumpet. I further pointed out that there were about twelve thousand inhabitants in the district, that they might discard all women and children, and all too young to be called “elderly,” and all those who could not be described by a child as tall. I then put it to them: Suppose the police had on that day arrested and searched every man not excluded from the description, how many do you think would be found carrying a purse showing those two colours and a mouth-trumpet? 
          
          
         You are entitled to treat the matter as one of probability, or, to use a popular phrase, as a question of odds. Now, you are in a position to treat this question in the same way in which that jury was allowed to treat and did treat that question; but if you consider the evidence you have heard from the experts, and the known scientific facts, you will have to bear in mind that a grey suit or a purse or a mouth-trumpet may be readily acquired or lost, while a particular mark in a particular place in a finger-print is unalterable, though of course every finger-print has many marks. 
          
          
         But, after all, are we dealing with anything absolutely new or, strange? It has long been known that every hair in a man’s head has its own place, and if you could make an accurate map of a few square inches of a man’s scalp, fixing the place of each hair by means of fine lines of latitude and longitude, and you were then to try and find another man presenting exactly the same features in this respect, you would, I have no doubt, find it extremely difficult if not impossible. Such a fact when established has no value as a means of identification because it is not practicable to use it, but it may be and probably is as firmly established a biological fact as those relating to finger-marks.” 
          
         
        
       
     93 His Honour concluded the summing up with the following illustration: 
      
       
        
         
         “I take from my pocket this bunch of keys. You see that they are of various sorts and sizes, made to fit a considerable variety of locks. Suppose you were now to arrest every man in New Zealand who possessed a bunch of keys, can you suppose for a moment that you would find another man whose keys correspond in type and detail with mine to the extent of, say, one-quarter of their number? You might occasionally find one or even two which corresponded, but would you expect to find more? The proposed illustration may at first sight appear to go too far, but if the accepted scientific facts respecting finger-marks are true facts, that illustration presents a fairly close analogy.” 
         
        
       
     94 As noted above the logical problem with the Prosecutor’s Fallacy, in its most usual form, is that it ignores the number of persons who may have committed the offence by purporting to devise a statement as to the odds that the accused is the father from what the DNA tests indicate is the probability that the accused is the father, rather than the person taken at random from the community. Whether or not a jury is likely to be mislead into this form of reasoning depends on an assessment of the whole of the evidence and of the summing-up. In the present case, the trial judge did not provide any assistance to the jury by way of relating technical issues of probability to matters within their own experience. 
      
       
     95 Mr Goetz’s evidence and the trial judge’s summing-up reiterated, on a number of occasions, the precise nature of the evidence in the correct form. There was, however, one matter which may have suggested an inappropriate form of reasoning to the jury. That matter is the content of the record of interview. 
      
       
     96 I have quoted the relevant extract from the record of interview above. To reiterate the police officer said: 
      
       
        
         
         “That you were the only one in two million, four hundred thousand … that you could be the father”. 
         
        
       
       
       Further, in relation to the relative chance of paternity percentages, the police officer said: 
        
        
         
         “It’s also saying the relevant chance of paternity is greater than ninety nine point ninety nine percent. So there’s less than nought point nought one per cent that you aren’t the father”. 
         
        
        
       and 
        
        
         
         “And it shows that ninety nine point nine nine nine per cent of chance that you are the paternal father”. 
         
        
       
     97 The questioning, which was in any event inadmissible, did commit the Prosecutor’s Fallacy. It came from a police officer, rather than an expert or the trial judge and was, accordingly, of limited significance. Nevertheless, in the absence of any direction about the assessment of probabilities generally, it would have been desirable for the trial judge to have warned the jury about the impermissibility of this line of reasoning. 
      
       
        
        
       DNA Evidence and the Proviso 
       
     98 The Courts have approached DNA evidence with caution. However, that caution is naturally abating as experience with the use of such evidence has grown. 
      
       
     99 A similar process occurred less than a century ago when fingerprint evidence was comparatively new. Fingerprinting was adopted in England for criminal identification only in 1901, a decade after Sir Francis Galton’s book “Fingerprints” was published. (See Dodds “Identification by Fingerprints” (1986) 18 Australian Journal of Forensic Sciences 136.) 
      
       
     100 In R v Parker [1912] VLR 152, the prisoner had been convicted of breaking into a warehouse and stealing, from a safe. A fingerprint was left on a bottle that was in the warehouse. The fingerprint matched the fingerprint of the prisoner. The trial judge reserved a question for the Supreme Court. The question was: “When the only evidence against an accused person depends upon the resemblance between fingerprints, as in this case, whether such evidence is sufficient to support a conviction?”101 By majority, the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria affirmed the conviction. Madden CJ was in dissent. The Chief Justice said at 156: 
      
       
        
         
         “The finger-print was found here on a ginger-beer bottle, and the Crown did not call the people through whose hands the bottle had gone, the man who had delivered it at the shop, or the woman who sold it to the boy. The finger-print might have been made by one of them. Or it might conceivably have been handled by the prisoner somewhere before it came to the owner of the house which was broken into. And apart from that, there is the general danger of saying that these prints may be relied on as exclusive evidence, when other evidence might have been called, but was not, which might have thrown light on the matter, one way or the other.” 
         
        
       
     102 The Chief Justice, reflecting the judicial caution we have witnessed in recent years about DNA evidence, said at 153-155; 
      
       
        
         
         “I regret that I am unable in this case to agree with my learned brethren in holding that the resemblance between the finger-prints on the bottle found in the room where the robbery was committed and the prisoner’s finger-prints, standing alone, is sufficient evidence to warrant the conviction of the prisoner. The extreme danger of arriving at such a conclusion warrants me in not deferring to their opinions. We are asked to accept the theory that the correspondence between two sets of finger-prints is conclusive evidence of the identity of the person who made those prints as an established scientific fact, standing on the same basis as the proposition of Euclid or other matters vouched for by science and universally accepted as proved. If this finger-print theory were generally recognized by scientific men as standing on this basis, there would be no more to be said. It is said that the markings on the fingers of any individual retain their special characteristics from the cradle to the grave, and also that the markings on the fingers of no two individuals are the same, so that absolute correspondence between a finger-print and the markings on a man’s hand is unmistakable evidence that he is the person who made such print. 
         
        
        
         
         My difficulty arises from the fact that the subject of finger-prints has not been sufficiently studied to enable these propositions to be laid down as scientific facts. Finger-prints have been studied by Monsieur Bertillon in France from an anthropometrical point of view, and by Sir Francis Galton and a few others, doubtless highly intelligent persons, from the standpoint of mere observers. But the matter has not been investigated by scientists generally so that we can say that the propositions relied on by the Crown are accepted scientific facts. … 
         
        
        
         
         The jury are told that the markings on a man’s fingers never alter, and are different in every man. The jurymen know nothing in the world about that matter; they strike nothing like it in their daily lives. This is that kind of evidence that is particularly dangerous, for it carries with it a savour of mystery, as in this case the detective swears that no two men’s markings are alike, and it is assumed not only that that is true, but that there is some mysterious brand implanted on man’s hand for some definite purpose of characterizing him physically.” 
         
        
       
     103 The majority in Parker were Hodges and Cussen JJ. Hodges J said at 157-158: 
      
       
        
         
         “Now, supposing it were proved or admitted that the finger-print on the article stolen corresponded in every respect with the mark of the peculiar finger of the man charged with the theft, and supposing there were corroboration of that evidence by other witnesses – as is this case there were two of them – swearing positively to the identity of the impression on the article stolen with the impression of the accused’s finger, it seems to me it would be the very safest possible evidence of identity that could be submitted to the jury, more trustworthy than the momentary glance that some individual might have had of the accused’s face. I do not think it is necessary to say that there could not be any other finger-mark in the world like it, and I agree with what the learned Chief Justice has said as to the inadmissibility of that piece of evidence. In the same way, if a child who sees the accused’s face for a moment swears positively to the person, she cannot say there is no other person in the world with a face like that.” 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       His Honour also said at 158: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         “In my opinion, it may be the safest of all evidence, as it does not depend upon the impressions caused by a momentary glance, but the impression is put on record, and the jury can see and judge for themselves as to the identity of the finger-marks, and the expert be merely a help to enable the jury to use the evidence of their own eyes.” 
         
        
       
     104 Cussen J generally agreed with Hodges J. 105 The High Court refused an ex parte application by the prisoner, Parker, for special leave to appeal against the decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria (Parker v The King (1912) 14 CLR 681). Griffith CJ said at 682-683: 
      
       
        
         
         “We think that leave must be refused. We are asked to allow the point to be argued whether, when evidence of finger prints is the only evidence of identity, it is sufficient to support a conviction. Leave is asked in the hope that the rule may be laid down that it is not. Signatures have been accepted as evidence of identity as long as they have been used. The fact of the individuality of the corrugations of the skin on the fingers of the human hand is now so generally recognized as to require very little, if any, evidence of it, although it seems to be still the practice to offer some expert evidence on the point. A finger print is therefore in reality an unforgeable signature. That is now recognized in a large part of the world and in some parts, has I think, been recognized for many centuries. It is certainly now generally recognized in England and other parts of the British Dominions. If that is so, there is in this case evidence that the prisoner’s signature was found in the place which was broken into, and was found under such circumstances that it could only have been impressed at the time when the crime was committed. It is impossible under those circumstances to say there was no evidence to go to the jury. 
         
        
       
     106 The use of DNA evidence appears to have reached a similar stage to fingerprint evidence in about 1912. Like fingerprint evidence, it is of particular power, both to establish innocence and guilt. 
      
       
        
       Application of the Proviso 
       
     107 The application of the proviso in s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 involves the formulation of a judgment on which minds frequently differ. Courts of Criminal Appeal are often divided in its application. The High Court, often by majority, frequently comes to a different conclusion from a court of criminal appeal. 
      
       
     108 The errors committed in the present case are not, either singly or cumulatively, of so fundamental a character as to lead to the conclusion that there was hardly a trial at all. (See Wilde v The Queen (1988) 164 CLR 365 at 373; Glennon v The Queen (1993-1994) 179 CLR 1 at 8; Green v The Queen (1996-1997) 191 CLR 334 at 346-347 and c/f 371-372.) 
      
       
     109 The issue in the present case is whether a conviction was inevitable notwithstanding the errors committed, so that it cannot be said that the Appellant lost a chance of acquittal. (See Wilde v The Queen (supra) at 374; Glennon v The Queen (supra) at 8-9; Gilbert v The Queen (2000) 201 CLR 414 at [19]-[20]; [52]; [85]-[86]; KRM v The Queen (supra) at [72] and [123]-[129]; Grey v The Queen [2001] HCA 65 at [26]-[27]; [55]-[56].) 
      
       
     110 I do not attribute significance to the fact that the appellant was confronted in the record of interview with scientific evidence which he was unable to explain. In this regard, the Appellant’s clear denials may well have worked to his advantage, as trial counsel could have properly determined. Nevertheless, it is wrong in principle for a police officer in the course of an examination to press too strongly on an interviewee scientific interpretations and conclusions in a manner suggestive of entrapment. I have in mind particularly the question in the record of interview in the present case: 
      
       
        
         
         “So you see there’s no other reason for the results showing that you are the father. Can you think of any reason?” 
         
        
       
       
       In another case the unfairness implicit in such a line of examination may lead to a different result. 
        
       
     111 The errors I have identified relate to a risk that the jury may have been confused about, or been unable to properly assess the weight of the DNA evidence. This was, of course, the critical evidence in the case. That fact tends against the application of the proviso but is not, in my opinion, determinative in the present case. 
      
       
     112 Controversial issues have arisen in other cases about the weight that ought be given to DNA evidence and to the statistical representation in a single figure of the significance of that evidence. In this case neither at trial nor on appeal has there been any suggestion, either by way of submission or evidence on the part of the Appellant, which has, in the particular context of this case, cast any doubt about the paternity index and its significance in the trial. Nothing has called into question the conclusion that the odds were that it was 2,400,000 more likely that it was the accused who was the father than a person taken at random from the community. 
      
       
     113 The qualities of the samples in this case were uniformly high, unlike the frequently degraded and difficult to extract DNA from “crime stains” in other cases. There was no suggestion in this case about inefficient or inappropriate police conduct in obtaining and handling samples. (See e.g. R v Lisoff [1999] NSWCCA 364). Nor was there any suggestion of any doubt about the integrity of the samples by reason of laboratory procedures. Nor was any issue raised about the validity of the size of the data bases used, as discussed in R v Pantoja (1996) 88 ACrimR 554. (In the retrial there was no challenge to the validity of the data bases. See R v Pantoja (No 2) (NSWCCA, 5 November 1998, unreported).) Nor was there any issue about the validity of the system used to conduct the testing, relevantly, in the case of the second group of tests conducted in the present case, the profiler plus system. (See R v Karger [2001] SASC 264; R v Gallagher [2001] NSWSC 462).  
      
       
     114 It is of central significance that the circumstances of the present case restrict to an exceptionally unusual degree the number of persons who could possibly have committed the crime. (In terms of Bayes’ theorem the prior odds based on this measurable factor only were very low.) This affects each of the errors I have identified. 
      
       
     115 The Relative Chance of Paternity percentage of 99.9999 percent should not have been before the jury. The particular circumstances of this case are that two out of five possible suspects had been scientifically eliminated and the possibility that two of the remaining three could have committed the act was low. In these circumstances, the Paternity Index comes closer to the degree of certainty suggested in the high percentage computed for Relative Chance of Paternity. Similarly, the difference between the statement of odds in the permissible form and a statement which commits the Prosecutor’s Fallacy, becomes smaller. In the case of each of these errors, the extent to which the jury could have been misled was substantially attenuated by the particular circumstances of the case. 
      
       
     116 This distinction was appreciated by the Court of Appeal in R v Doheny and Adams (supra) where the Court stated the Prosecutor’s Fallacy in the form of a syllogism at 372-373: 
      
       
        
         
         “1 Only one person in a million will have a DNA profile which matches that of the crime stain. 
         
        
        
         
         2 The defendant has a DNA profile which matches the crime stain. 
         
        
        
         
         3 Ergo there is a million to one probability that the defendant left the crime stain and is guilty of the crime.” 
         
        
       
       
       The Court went on to say at 373: 
        
        
         
         “Taking our example, the prosecutor’s fallacy can be simply demonstrated. If one person in a million has a DNA profile which matches that obtained from the crime stain, then the suspect will be 1 of perhaps 26 men in the United Kingdom who share that characteristic.  
         If no fact is known about the Defendant, other than that he was in the United Kingdom at the time of the crime 
         , the DNA evidence tells us no more than that there is a statistical probability that he was the criminal of 1 in 26. 
         
        
        
         
         The significance of the DNA evidence will depend critically upon what else is known about the suspect. If he has a convincing alibi at the other end of England at the time of the crime, it will appear highly improbable that he could have been responsible for the crime, despite his matching DNA profile. If, however, he was near the scene of the crime when it was committed, or has been identified as a suspect because of other evidence which suggests that he may have been responsible for the crime, the DNA evidence becomes very significant.  
         The possibility that two of the only 26 men in the United Kingdom with the matching DNA should have been in the vicinity of the crime will seem almost incredible 
          and a comparatively slight nexus between the defendant and the crime, independent of the DNA, is likely to suffice to present an overall picture to the jury that satisfies them of the defendant’s guilt.” 
          (Emphasis added) 
         
        
       
     117 The same reasoning applies with even greater force in the present case. By reason of the particular circumstances of the victim in this case, there were only five men who had access to her. Two were ruled out by DNA tests. Two did not have DNA tests conducted but were both disabled persons, one in a wheelchair and the other blind, both with difficulties of access and subject to supervision. The possibility that one of these patients was one of the two or three persons in Australia other than the Appellant with the DNA profile of the father is, in my opinion, not a credible hypothesis. 
      
       
     118 I have not found this judgment an easy one. I have, however, concluded that in the particular circumstances of this case, the unchallenged Paternity Index was of such force that a conviction was inevitable. The proviso should be applied and the appeal against conviction dismissed. 
      
       
        
       Sentence 
       
     119 The submissions in this regard were briefly put. The Appellant submitted that the sentence was outside the appropriate range. Specifically, it was submitted that the Appellant’s age, the strong evidence of good character, and the strong prospects of rehabilitation were such that the usual ratio should be varied to reduce the non-parole period. 
      
       
     120 The maximum penalty for the offence was twenty years imprisonment. His Honour imposed a sentence of seven years with a non-parole period of five years and three months. The objective seriousness of the offence was high. His Honour took into account all the relevant factors, including the subjective circumstances to which the appellant made particular reference. 
      
       
     121 In my opinion, the sentence was within the range which his Honour could legitimately impose. I detect no error which could justify the intervention of this Court. I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal. 
      
       
        
       
     122 SULLY J: I agree with the Chief Justice. 
      
       
     123 ADAMS J: I agree.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
     1 GREG JAMES, J: The present applicant for leave to appeal against sentence pleaded guilty in the District Court of New South Wales to one count of commit robbery in circumstances of aggravation contrary to s.97 of the Crimes Act 1900. He had earlier pleaded guilty before a magistrate. 
      
       
     2 The circumstance of aggravation was that in the course of a robbery of a shopkeeper he used an offensive weapon; that is to say, a syringe. That offence is punishable by a maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment. He was sentenced to imprisonment for four years, commencing on 4 June 2000 and expiring on 3 June 2004. A non-parole period was imposed of two years, expiring on 3 June 2002. He had been arrested and charged on 4 June 2000. His Honour back-dated the sentence to commence on the day that the applicant first entered custody. 
      
       
     3 The short facts were set out by the learned trial judge in his remarks on sentence. They were taken to an extent from the appellant's recorded interview. I summarise them. 
      
       
     4 Shortly prior to nine o'clock on Sunday 4 June 2000 the offender went into the Wang Sheng mixed business at Marrickville. The victim, Yong Pei Wang, was behind the counter. There were customers in the store. The applicant posed as a customer. He had at the time an uncapped syringe with him (the trial judge did not conclude that it was a dirty syringe). He produced the syringe, contending in the record of interview, he was keeping it far away from his victim so it would not hurt him but hoping, as the trial judge found, to put the victim in fear.  
      
       
     5 He sought money. The wife of the victim came in with a Club lock. He had sought to open the cash register. Being unable to do it, he saw money in a cardboard box and he picked up a quantity of that money in his right hand. He was struck on the hand by the wife with the Club lock and in the course of his being restrained a struggle ensued. He was pinned to the floor and held until police were obtained with the assistance of the other customers. 
      
       
     6 The victim sustained bruises and grazes at the top of his head, a sore neck and minor cuts to his head. The offender got nothing.  
      
       
     7 He had a minimal prior criminal record, having arrived in Australia in 1996 from New Zealand, but had embarked since the beginning of 2000 upon crime, committing various offences of shoplifting. 
      
       
     8 He was one of eleven children, having been born in New Zealand on 28 August 1961. His family reside in New Zealand, except that when he came to Australia he came with his elder son but his relationship with that son commenced to deteriorate in 1998. He plans to return to New Zealand in due course. 
      
       
     9 He has a narcotic problem, as his Honour found, but it is said that the narcotic use commenced only after the problem had manifested itself with his elder son; that is, in the two years prior to the commission of the offence. Whilst in custody he had been seeking to reduce his drug dependence and apparently was having some degree of success in that regard. In particular he sought that the non-parole period and parole period ratio be varied so as to permit him the opportunity of treatment once he leaves custody. 
      
       
     10 The trial judge found that he had displayed remorse in the witness box, not only remorse for what harm he had done to the shopkeeper and for the distress and embarrassment he caused to his family, but also for his having offended against the community. 
      
       
     11 His Honour took into account the limited degree of planning, limited actual violence and the early plea, as well as the requirements for general deterrence. Those matters, he pointed out, can, in particular circumstances, lead, to some substantial degree, to rehabilitation. His Honour also referred to the requirements of particular deterrence but, regrettably, one passage in his Honour's remarks dealing with particular deterrence does not appear to have been accurately recorded.  
      
       
     12 However his Honour treated particular deterrence, it does seem, having regard to the general sense and the context of the passage, to have been affected to some degree by a view that particular deterrence should be mitigated in favour of rehabilitation. He found special circumstances, namely, the need for rehabilitation, as warranting an adjustment of the ratio of the non-parole period to the parole period. It is contended, however, that his Honour fell into error, particularly in two respects. 
      
       
     13 Firstly, his Honour gave the prisoner the benefit of an early plea. He referred to the judgment of this court in Regina v. Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. His Honour expressed the relevant discount as being a discount of 30%. His Honour noted, however:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""That is not to say that I should merely show what the penalty should be and reduce it down to 30 per cent. The fact is that still I must take into account a number of other circumstances before determining sentence."" 
         
        
       
     14 Thirty per cent, much less down to 30%, is a discount well in excess of what an early plea simpliciter would receive applying this court's decision in Thomson & Houlton (supra). Nevertheless, his Honour referred to that 30% discount in the context of referring to ""the old principle"" that one must consider whether or not it is inevitable an offender would be convicted. His Honour said:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""A court should not go overboard in giving a percentage because the plea is at the earliest time and adhered to throughout when it was perfectly clear he was guilty of the offence and in this instance the offender was caught red-handed during the offence."" 
         
        
       
     15 Subsequent decisions of this court have established the principle that the utilitarian discount referred to in Thomson & Houlton (supra) is not to be reduced by reference to the strength of the Crown case. Such discount as is provided for contrition or remorse may be reduced. It is perfectly apparent here, however, that his Honour was not talking about that latter discount. It seems on a literal reading of what his Honour said, that after discounting the early plea his Honour provided for a discount figure of some 30%. All of this on its face seems to be far too favourable in the discounting process to the applicant. 
      
       
     16 On the other hand, his Honour also had reference to the decision of this court in Regina v. Henry & Ors (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 and expressed his view of that decision as embodying a starting point of six years or at least no less than five years of what they used to call the head sentence.  
      
       
     17 His Honour adverts to certain of the matters discussed in Henry (supra) as appropriate to the range of sentences approved in that decision. It is contended that his Honour fell into error in applying the decision in Henry (supra) as he did and in particular fell into error in accepting that that decision provided for a starting point head sentence of six years.  
      
       
     18 Nonetheless, when one considers what his Honour did and the sentences imposed as a whole and has regard to the duty cast on this court to review the sentences in accordance with s.6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, it is necessary, before the court can interfere with what is an exercise by a trial judge of that trial judge's discretion, to reach a conclusion that there is some other sentence warranted in law and which should have been passed. So that it is not merely enough to show error, particularly error counter-balancing error, in what the trial judge did. It is necessary there be shown such error in the result as shows that the sentence exceeds the permissible lawful range of sentence to be imposed by the trial judge in the exercise of a lawful discretion. 
      
       
     19 In the present case a non-parole period of two years has been the primary focus of the submissions. It is understandable that reference might be made to all those favourable matters which might show that the offender is coming to a point in his life, albeit late, in which rehabilitation might be achieved and the drug abuse and criminality set aside. Whilst one can appreciate those considerations moving the argument, it remains that the court cannot interfere unless persuaded of error in the legal sense required for the court to intervene in the exercise of the trial judge's discretion. 
      
       
     20 I am unpersuaded that there is error in the upshot of this sentence. I would propose that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed. 
      
       
     21 BELL, J: I agree. 
      
       
     22 GREG JAMES, J: The orders will be as I have proposed.

       ROLLS ROYCE INDUSTRIAL POWER (PACIFIC) LIMITED (FORMERLY JOHN THOMPSON (AUSTRALIA) PTY LIMITED) v JAMES HARDIE & COY PTY LIMITED 
        
        
       JAMES HARDIE & COY PTY LIMITED v THE STATE OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
        
        
       JAMES HARDIE & COY PTY LIMITED v ROLLS ROYCE INDUSTRIAL POWER (PACIFIC) LIMITED (FORMERLY JOHN THOMPSON (AUSTRALIA) PTY LIMITED) 
        
        
       The court heard, in effect, two appeals and an application for leave to appeal. They arose out of an action by Mr Warren Hay, who had contracted mesothelioma as a result of exposure to asbestos dust and fibre when employed as a fitter’s assistant in the construction of Wallerawang Power Station for what is now Pacific Power. His employer, John Thompson Australia Pty Ltd was the head contractor and is now Rolls Royce Industrial Power (Pacific) Limited (Rolls Royce). Mr Hay sued Rolls Royce and Pacific Power in the Dust Diseases Tribunal, with the principal action settled for a total verdict of $370 000, being divided equally between Rolls Royce and Pacific Power.  
        
        
       Both Rolls Royce and Pacific Power pressed cross-claims against James Hardie and Coy Pty Limited (James Hardie) for contribution under s5 of the  
       Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 
        1946 because the asbestos products which Mr Hay was exposed to were manufactured, sold and supplied by James Hardie without any warning as to its toxic potential. Pacific Power settled it’s cross-claim against James Hardie, with James Hardie paying a sum equal to 70% of Pacific Power’s liability to Mr Hay. Consequent upon this settlement being entered as a judgment, James Hardie sought contribution from Rolls Royce for its liability to Pacific Power, as well as further claiming contribution from the State of NSW on the basis that NSW had knowledge of the danger to which Mr Hay was exposed and did not adequately exercise its powers to protect him. Rolls Royce’s cross-claim against James Hardie continued, and was amended in December 1996 to include a claim for damages for breach of contract in relation to the sale of the asbestos products. Curtis J extended time under the  
       Limitation Act  
       1969 to permit the bringing of the contract claim. This decision is an issue on appeal.  
        
        
       At trial, Curtis J dismissed the contract claims brought by Rolls Royce against James Hardie, and found that both Rolls Royce and James Hardie were in gross breach of their duty of care to Mr Hay. The apportionment of responsibility was found to be equal between Rolls Royce and James Hardie, and a net verdict was entered in favour of Rolls Royce against James Hardie for the sum of $37,750. James Hardie was ordered to pay Rolls Royce’s costs with the exception of the contract claim, and this is the subject of the leave application. Curtis J found that NSW was not liable to Mr Hay and even if it had been, held that it was not just and equitable that it should contribute to the liability of James Hardie. 
        
        
       In its appeal against James Hardie, Rolls Royce sought a complete indemnity under s5 of the  
       Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 
        1946 or, alternatively, a contractual indemnity arising out of the supply contracts. James Hardie contended that the extension of time for Rolls Royce’s bringing of a contract claim was beyond power. There are questions of costs in relation to a Calderbank letter and the bringing of the failed contract claim. James Hardie, in its case against NSW, submitted that the State had the power to control the risk producing activity and that a duty of care was owed to Mr Hay, as well as that although Curtis J found the plaintiff’s damage had resulted in part from the fault of NSW he held James Hardie wholly responsible. The State of NSW contended that Curtis J decided to ‘exempt’ the state from liability under s 5(2)  
       Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 
        1946.  
       
       
        
       Held: Per Stein JA (Fitzgerald and Davies AJJA agreeing) 
       : 
        
        
       Rolls Royce v James Hardie  
        
       
     1. The extension of time granted by Curtis J under s60G of the Limitation Act  1989 in respect of the breach of contract claim by Rolls Royce was beyond power. The injury claimed by Rolls Royce was economic loss by reason of breach of contract, it was not an action for damages for personal injury. The words ‘for damages for personal injury’ require the identification of the loss for which the damage is claimed, and it is clear that the loss is economic. 
      
       
        
       - Unsworth v Commissioner for Railways (1958) 101 CLR 73 considered 
        
       - Ackbar v CF Green & Co Ltd [1958] 1 QB 582 considered 
        
       
     2. There was sufficient evidence for Curtis J to infer that Rolls Royce had actual knowledge of the dangers of asbestos dust at the relevant time. This inference was clearly open and made after a careful analysis of the evidence. His Honour’s discretion did not miscarry nor was the apportionment unreasonable or plainly unjust. 
      
       
     3. Asbestos products are not in themselves inherently dangerous products, rather it is the manner in which they are used or processed which creates the danger. It is unclear to what extent any such category of tort still survives. The proposition that James Hardie, due to the nature of the product, had an overriding duty to ensure that Rolls Royce took necessary steps to negate the risk, amounts to saying that James Hardies’ duty to Rolls Royce renders the negligence of Rolls Royce irrelevant.  
      
       
       - Putt v James Hardie & Co Pty Limited  
       (1998) 43 NSWLR 554 applied 
        
       - Muller v Lalic  
       [2000] NSWCA 50 considered 
       
     4. If Wynbergen v Hoyts Corporation Ltd (1997) 72 ALJR 65 is applied to s 5 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946, then it is not possible to have a 100% contribution. 5. Curtis J undertook an orthodox exercise of discretionary power under s 5 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946 to apportion liability. The evidence did not justify a 100% or complete indemnity.6. The settlement between the two sole defendant’s to Mr Hay’s action cannot bind the apportionment with other tortfeasors. James Hardie was a tortfeasor who would, if sued, have been liable to Mr Hay. Matters pertaining to the settlement between Rolls Royce and Pacific Power cannot operate to bar James Hardie from seeking contribution from Rolls Royce. Curtis J assessed what was just and equitable between the tortfeasors present in the contribution proceedings before him. There was no error in his approach. 
      
       
       - Maxfield v Llewellyn  
       (1961) 1 WLR 1119 applied 
       
       
     7. The filing of a cross-claim for contribution by James Hardie after the receipt of a Calderbank letter made by James Hardie to Rolls Royce constituted a relevant change of circumstance. 
      
       
     - Gaskins v British Aluminium Co Ltd [1976] 1 QB 524 applied- Preotta v Times Newspaper Ltd [1991] 4 All ER 46 applied- Fowdh v Fowdh (Unreported, NSWCA 4 November 1993) per Mahoney JA applied 
      
       
     8. The principle referred to by Hodgson J in Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd v FAI General Insurance Co Ltd  (Unreported NSWSC, 3 June 1998), that a successful party gets their costs where an issue has been raised reasonably and was not disproportionate to the case as a whole, was not inconsistent with Curtis J’s earlier statement about the costs of severable claims.  
      
       
        
       James Hardie v The State of New South Wales 
       
       
     1. The exercise of his Honour’s discretion in refusing the application to amend the cross-claim of James Hardie to extend the relevant period up to November 1961 did not miscarry.  
      
       
     2. Curtis J was purporting to exercise the exemption power under s 5(2) of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946. The discretion is a very wide one and should not be construed so as to be subject to a limitation which is not apparent in the ordinary meaning of the words conferring the power. No miscarriage of discretion by his Honour is revealed, particularly when read in light of the findings made about the extreme culpability of James Hardie. It was open to his Honour to exempt the State of NSW from contribution. 
      
       
     3. There is no principle of law that where two tortfeasors are independently at fault, there can never be a complete indemnity or exemption.  
      
       
     - Ryan v Fildes  [1938] 3 All ER 517 considered- Higgins v William Inglis & Son Pty Ltd [1978] 1 NSWLR 649 considered- Sherras v Van der Maat (1989) 1 Qd R 114 considered- Ward Enterprises Pty Ltd v Ahern [2000] NSWCA 184 considered- K v P (J third party) [1993] Ch 140 distinguished 
      
       
        
       Per Fitzgerald AJA: 
        
       
     1. The principles that restrict an appellate court’s power to review a trial judge’s decision on apportionment have been repeatedly reaffirmed. It is insufficient for an appellant to persuade an appeal court that the trial judge’s apportionment is different from that the appeal court would have decided. An appeal court is not entitled to interfere if the trial judge’s apportionment is reasonably open. 
      
       
     - Dunnet v Brennan [2000] NSWCA 211 applied- Fitzgerald v Dansey [2001] NSWCA 339 applied 
      
       
     2. As Rolls Royce received less on its claim for contribution and overall than offered by James Hardie in a Calderbank letter, and James Hardie succeeded in its contribution claim, James Hardie was entitled to the costs of the contribution proceedings between it and Rolls Royce.

       ROLLS ROYCE INDUSTRIAL POWER (PACIFIC) LIMITED (FORMERLY JOHN THOMPSON (AUSTRALIA) PTY LIMITED) v JAMES HARDIE & COY PTY LIMITED 
        
        
       JAMES HARDIE & COY PTY LIMITED v THE STATE OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
        
        
       JAMES HARDIE & COY PTY LIMITED v ROLLS ROYCE INDUSTRIAL POWER (PACIFIC) LIMITED (FORMERLY JOHN THOMPSON (AUSTRALIA) PTY LIMITED) 
        
        
        JUDGMENT 
        
        
       
     1 STEIN JA : 
      
       
       Introduction 
        
       
     2 In effect the court is hearing two appeals. One by Rolls Royce against James Hardie, and the second by James Hardie against the State of New South Wales. Also before the court is an application by James Hardie for leave to appeal on costs. 
      
       
       The litigation 
        
       
     3 The appeals arise in this way. The plaintiff, Mr Warren Hay, contracted mesothelioma as a result of exposure to asbestos dust and fibre between 1958 and 1961. He was then employed as a fitter’s assistant in the construction of the Wallerawang Power station for what is now styled Pacific Power. His employer, John Thompson Australia Pty Limited was the head contractor and is now Rolls Royce Industrial Power (Pacific) Limited (Rolls Royce). The plaintiff sued Rolls Royce and Pacific Power in the Dust Diseases Tribunal. On 27 June 1994 his principal action was settled and a judgment entered in his favour against Pacific Power in the sum of $185,000 and also against Rolls Royce in the same sum, ie a total verdict of $370,000. 
      
       
     4 Before this judgment was entered, Rolls Royce had filed a cross-claim against Pacific Power seeking contribution under s 5 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946 (the Act). This claim was dismissed by consent orders also filed on 27 June 1994. 
      
       
     5 Thereafter, both Rolls Royce and Pacific Power pressed cross-claims against James Hardie and Coy Pty Limited (James Hardie) for contribution under s 5 because the asbestos products to which the plaintiff was exposed were manufactured, sold and supplied by James Hardie to Rolls Royce without any warning as to the toxic potential of asbestos dust. 
      
       
     6 Pacific Power’s cross-claim against James Hardie was settled on 24 June 1999. Judgment was directed in favour of Pacific Power against James Hardie in the sum of $129,500, being 70% of Pacific Power’s liability to the plaintiff. Rolls Royce’s cross-claim against James Hardie was not settled but continued. 
      
       
     7 On 13 December 1996 the cross-claim by Rolls Royce against James Hardie was amended to include, in addition to a s 5 claim for contribution, a claim for damages for breach of contract in relation to the sale of the asbestos products by James Hardie to Rolls Royce. The Sale of Goods Act 1923 was also relied upon. His Honour extended time under the Limitation Act 1969 to permit Rolls Royce to bring the contract claim against James Hardie. This decision is in issue in the appeal. 
      
       
     8 Consequent upon suffering judgment in the cross-claim by Pacific Power, James Hardie claimed contribution from Rolls Royce under s 5 in respect of that liability. 
      
       
     9 Furthermore, James Hardie claimed a s 5 contribution from the State of New South Wales (NSW), alleging that NSW would, if sued by the plaintiff, have been found liable to him in negligence. In essence, the claim was that NSW had knowledge of the dangers to which the plaintiff was exposed and adequate power to protect him, yet unreasonably failed to exercise those powers. 
      
       
        
       Judgment of trial judge 
        
       
     10 In giving judgment on 15 October 1999, Curtis J dismissed the contract claims brought by Rolls Royce against James Hardie. His Honour found that James Hardie was in breach of its duty of care to the plaintiff and that its breach was gross. Rolls Royce was also found to be in breach of its duty of care to the plaintiff and his Honour embarked upon the task of apportionment between it and James Hardie. Curtis J concluded that apportionment of responsibility should be equal between James Hardie and Rolls Royce. On the mathematics, this meant that both of them were liable for $147,250 of the plaintiffs’ judgments totalling $370,000. His Honour noted that that was 39.8% of the total liability, while Pacific Power bore 15% of the liability and another party, Wallaby Grip (which had contributed $20,000) 5.4%. 
      
       
     11 In the result, his Honour entered a verdict of $37,750 in favour of Rolls Royce against James Hardie and ordered the latter to pay Rolls Royce’s costs of the hearing, with the exception of the costs of the contract claim, which he ordered that each party bear itself. This latter aspect of the costs order is in dispute, as is the disputed effect of a Calderbank letter. 
      
       
     12 His Honour then turned to the claim for contribution by James Hardie against NSW. 
      
       
     13 His Honour found that the relevant powers in the Scaffolding and Lifts Act 1902 as amended did not confer power on NSW to control the risk producing activity at Wallerawang. The statute conferred that power on inspectors, who were not subject to ministerial control or direction in the performance of their duties. Having dealt with the issue of breach of its statutory powers and obligations, his Honour turned to what he described as the ‘general law duty’. He said that if the correct approach was the ‘spectrum analysis’ of Kirby J in Pyrenees Shire Council v Day (1998) 192 CLR 330, then there were good reasons to impose a duty of care on the State, of which it was in breach. Further, that that breach was causative of the plaintiff’s injury and NSW, had it been sued by the plaintiff, would have been found liable. 
      
       
     14 However, on the other hand, his Honour said that if the correct approach was the incremental one referred to by Brennan CJ and McHugh J in Pyrenees, the result might well be different, but ‘because of my views on apportionment’ he found it unnecessary to decide the nature of any duty owed or its breach. 
      
       
     15 Turning immediately to apportionment, his Honour said that even if NSW should have been liable to Mr Hay (contrary to the finding) it was not just and equitable that it should contribute to the liability of James Hardie. His Honour added: 
      
       
        
         
         … James Hardie created a danger which the State merely failed to avoid. James Hardie made large profits from selling vast quantities of asbestos products heedless of the dangers to others which James Hardie knew to be created by the use of these products. Essentially James Hardie submit that a loss inevitably flowing from these commercial activities should be borne in part, not out of James Hardie’s profits or risk capital, but by the taxpayers of New South Wales. Such a result would in my opinion be neither just nor equitable having regard to the State’s responsibility for the damage.  
         
        
       
     16 Accordingly, his Honour entered judgment for NSW against James Hardie. 
      
       
       The appeals in summary 
        
       
     17 In its appeal against James Hardie, Rolls Royce claims to be entitled to a complete indemnity under s 5 in respect of the judgment entered against it in favour of the plaintiff. Alternatively, it claims to be entitled to a contractual indemnity arising out of James Hardie’s breach of implied terms in the supply contracts entered into between it and James Hardie. 
      
       
     18 It was submitted that when a comparative examination is made between the acts and omissions of each tortfeasor, the result should have been that contribution be to the level of full indemnity or that Rolls Royce should have been exempted from liability under s 5(2). Counsel for Rolls Royce, Mr Hall QC, sought to demonstrate from the evidence that the comparative culpability of James Hardie and Rolls Royce was such as must lead to a complete indemnity for his client. 
      
       
     19 In attacking his Honour’s findings of fact, Rolls Royce submit that there was no sufficient evidentiary basis to infer that it had actual knowledge of the dangers of asbestos dust during the relevant time. However, in so submitting, Rolls Royce conceded that it should have known, at least in general terms, of the dangers of asbestos dust. It conceded that it was guilty of negligence in not paying heed to the publicly available information. But, so it submitted, its failure fell short of gross negligence or recklessness.  
      
       
     20 Rolls Royce further submitted that the settlement between it and Pacific Power, made and entered as a judgment, resolved its cross-claim against Pacific Power. The settlement constituted binding admissions by each defendant that the apportionment of liability between them was 50/50. Accordingly, it was not open to Curtis J to contradict this apportionment, as he purported to do. Further, Rolls Royce contended that James Hardie was not permitted to bring contribution proceedings against it. 
      
       
     21 James Hardie submit that Rolls Royce cannot be entitled to a complete indemnity because both tortfeasors were independently at fault. It also argues that it was entitled to bring a contribution claim against Rolls Royce. The consent judgment in 1994 could not operate to bar any claim against Rolls Royce for contribution by James Hardie as it was against Rolls Royce in favour of Mr Hay. Rolls Royce’s liability to the plaintiff under the 1994 judgment satisfied the second limb of the statute. 
      
       
     22 In relation to Rolls Royce’s claim concerning the calculation of apportionment of damages, James Hardie submits that Rolls Royce has ignored the realities of multi-party litigation. The calculations were a product of how the litigation was conducted. 
      
       
     23 So far as the contract claim of Rolls Royce is concerned, James Hardie submits that it was statute-barred and that his Honour’s purported extension of time to bring the claim was beyond power. Alternatively, it submits that Rolls Royce’s actual knowledge of the dangers of asbestos dust, as found by his Honour, defeats the claim for any implied warranty. Additionally, it contends that even if a breach of a contractual warranty by James Hardie was found, Rolls Royce would only be entitled to nominal damages only. 
      
       
     24 There are also two disputes as to the costs awarded by his Honour. One concerns the effect of a Calderbank letter and the other the costs related to the failed contract claim. 
      
       
     25 In its case against the State, James Hardie submit that his Honour was wrong to find that NSW lacked governmental control over the construction of the power station at Wallerawang. On the contrary, it had the power to control the risk producing activity and its inspectors were subject to control by the State. The case was decided by his Honour prior to the High Court decision in Crimmins v SIFC (1999) 74 ALJR 1 and the later case of SIFC v Gibson [2000] NSWCA 179 in the Court of Appeal. James Hardie submits that, in accordance with Crimmins and Gibson, the knowledge of the inspectors could be imputed to the State, or at the least, it ought to have known of the dangers at Wallerawang and that this was sufficient to create a duty of care. 
      
       
     26 James Hardie also attack his Honour’s conclusion on apportionment. It says that his Honour took into account irrelevant considerations, or accorded them undue weight. Also, he failed to take account of relevant considerations. In effect, James Hardie submit that his Honour held James Hardie wholly responsible for the plaintiff’s damage, even though he found that the plaintiff’s damage had also resulted from the fault of the State. The power of complete indemnity or exemption in s 5(2) could not justify his Honour’s decision, although in its written submissions James Hardie submitted that Curtis J did not in fact purport to exercise the exemption power. 
      
       
     27 James Hardie submits that, as between it and NSW, an order for 50/50 apportionment would be appropriate. 
      
       
     28 The State says that there is no finding by his Honour that it was reasonably foreseeable by it that a failure to exercise its statutory powers would result in injury to Mr Hay. Indeed, they are to the contrary. Unlike Crimmins, there is no analogy between the State’s powers and the control exercised by the employer over the workplace conditions. Thirdly, this was not a case like Pyrenees, where the State had embarked upon the exercise of statutory powers but left that exercise uncompleted. 
      
       
     29 As to James Hardie’s attack upon his Honour’s conclusion on apportionment, NSW submits that it is not permissible in light of s 32 of the Dust Diseases Tribunal Act 1989 because there cannot be said to be an error of law in his Honour’s discretionary judgment. 
      
       
     30 NSW submits that Curtis J in fact decided to ‘exempt’ the State from liability to make contribution within the first limb of the concluding words of s 5(2). The exemption discretion is in unrestricted terms. Indemnification or exemption under s 5(2) is not limited to cases where there is no independent fault. The court’s discretion is unconfined by James Hardie’s suggested criterion of independent fault. 
      
       
     31 There is also dispute about the amendment of James Hardie’s claim against NSW, which was refused by the trial judge. 
      
       
        
        Rolls Royce v James Hardie 
        
        
       Was the contract claim statute-barred? 
        
       
     32 Although his Honour dismissed Rolls Royce’s claim in contract, James Hardie have filed a Notice of Contention seeking that his Honour’s decision should be affirmed on additional grounds. The first is that the contract claim was statute-barred and that his Honour had no power to extend the time in which to bring that claim. 
      
       
     33 The application by Rolls Royce to extend the time in which to bring its claim in contract arose in the following circumstances. On 3 June 1994 Rolls Royce filed a cross-claim against James Hardie for contribution or indemnity under s 5. This was a claim alleging tortious conduct (negligence) by James Hardie in relation to the verdict which Rolls Royce had accepted on 27 June 1994 be entered against it for $185,000. 
      
       
     34 On 13 December 1996 Rolls Royce filed an amended cross-claim which added paragraphs 10 – 31. These paragraphs sought to raise a cross-claim for damages for breach of contract. Rolls Royce conceded that the claim was out of time and sought an extension. 
      
       
     35 On 17 December 1996 his Honour granted Rolls Royce an extension of time to bring the contract claim, purportedly under s 60G of the Limitation Act 1989. 
      
       
     36 It is important to examine the pleading. The relevant paragraphs set up a series of contracts between the parties between 1955 and 1961 for the supply of a large quantity of asbestos products by James Hardie. These products were manufactured by James Hardie and used by Rolls Royce in the construction of the power station. The pleading proceeds to allege certain implied warranties and implied terms and conditions in the contracts, including Sale of Goods Act implied conditions, and their breach by James Hardie. 
      
       
     37 Paragraph 28 states that: 
      
       
        
         
         The Cross-Claimant, having been adjudged liable to the Plaintiff, suffered damage by reason of the breach of the said implied terms and conditions of the Contracts for Sale and the Cross-Claimant claims from the Cross-Defendant an Order for damages for breach of contract to the extent of indemnifying it against the damages it has been made liable for against the Plaintiff and the further relief set out in paragraph 31.  
           
         
        
       
     38 The amended cross-claim concludes with paragraph 31 which claims ‘damages for breach of contract’ which include the damages judgment which it consented to in favour of the plaintiff, as well as interest and the costs incurred by Rolls Royce in contesting the plaintiff’s claim. 
      
       
     39 Prima facie, the applicable limitation period for a cause of action founded on contract is 6 years from the date on which the cause of action first accrued, see s 14 of the Limitation Act. However, s 18A is to be noted. It employs the same language as s 60G, but limits the time within which a cause of action for personal injury is brought to 3 years. 
      
       
     40 Section 60G(1) applies to ‘a cause of action … founded on negligence, nuisance or breach of duty, for damages for personal injury …’. 
      
       
     41 The simple argument of James Hardie is that the claim for damages for breach of contract was not a claim ‘for damages for personal injury’ but rather a claim for damages for economic loss, where the measure of damages happened to be calculated in part by reference to the moneys paid by Rolls Royce in settlement of the plaintiff’s claim against it for damages for his personal injury. 
      
       
     42 Before turning to the authorities, it is useful to examine other relevant provisions in the Limitation Act. It will be observed that s 60G (and other provisions) include the words ‘breach of duty’ and that this is defined in s 11 as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         Breach of duty, when used in relation to a cause of action for damages for personal injury, extends to the breach of any duty (whether arising by statute, contract or otherwise) and includes trespass to the person. 
         
        
       
     43 Section 14, which deals with the general limitation period in contract and tort of 6 years, does not apply to an action for contribution under s 26. This provision, relating to a claim for contribution under s 5 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, contains its own limitation periods. From his Honour’s judgment of 17 December 1996 it appears that the extension of time application was not brought under s 26 and that Rolls Royce was out of time against James Hardie to claim contribution. However, s 60K makes it plain that an extension granted under s 60G extends any associated contribution action under s 26. 
      
       
     44 This conclusion is understandable when one looks to the pleading. Unlike paragraphs 1 – 9, paragraphs 10 – 31 are not a claim for contribution or indemnity under s 5, but a claim for damages for breach of contract ‘to the extent of indemnifying it [Rolls Royce] against the damages it has been made liable for against the plaintiff …’. 
      
       
     45 Rather, the application for an extension of time was in respect of what the Limitation Act terms an ‘Ordinary Action’. 
      
       
     46 I have already referred to s 60G. Provisions pertinent to s 60G are s 60I and cl 4 of Schedule 4. 
      
       
     47 In granting the extension of time to bring the contract claim, his Honour’s conclusions appear to be that s 60G includes a derivative action for economic loss and that the phrase ‘damages for personal injury’ in the section are sufficiently broad to cover damages for breach of contract concerning the moneys Rolls Royce paid to the plaintiff for his personal injury. 
      
       
     48 Unsworth v Commissioner for Railways (1958) 101 CLR 73 is of some assistance. Fullagar J (at 86) noted a submission of the appellant that his claim for contribution was not an action to recover damages in respect of personal injury within the meaning of the relevant legislation. His Honour said that the submission was right. He added (at 87) that: 
      
       
        
         
         … the natural reading of the words “action brought to recover damages or compensation in respect of personal injury” is to read them as referring to personal (i.e. physical) injury to the plaintiff himself or herself. …  
         
        
       
     49 Taylor J said (at 91): 
      
       
        
         
         The next question is whether the appellant’s claim against the commissioner was “an action to recover damages in respect of personal injury”. Clearly it was not. …  
         
        
       
     50 Unsworth, although distinguished in Genders v GIO (1959) 102 CLR 363 and GIO v Crittenden (1966) 117 CLR 412 in circumstances where a claim is made under an insurance policy indemnifying the claim ‘in respect of’ damage from personal injury, has been applied. See, for example, Smart J in Yates v Costain Australia Ltd (1989) 18 NSWLR 312 at 315 and earlier by Isaacs J in Spain v Metropolitan Meat Industry Board [1971] 1 NSWLR 91 at 99 - 100. 
      
       
     51 While Unsworth deals with different legislation and not with the present question of an action for damages for breach of contract under the Limitation Act, some assistance is derived from the approach of Fullagar and Taylor JJ by analogy with the present case. Genders and Crittenden on the other hand are concerned with when ‘for’ may be read as equivalent to ‘in respect of’ accidental bodily injury. I do not see that these authorities assist in the present context. Section 60G is concerned with claims for damages ‘for’ personal injury not ‘in respect of’ personal injury. 
      
       
     52 Ackbar v CF Green & Co Ltd [1975] 1 QB 582 although from England, is also helpful. The plaintiff, who was injured while a passenger in his own motor vehicle, sued his insurance brokers for damages for breach of contract for failing to obtain insurance. It was held that the measure of damages claimed did not consist of or include damages for personal injury. Croom-Johnson J noted that the claim was in contract and was a derivative one. The legislation under consideration, the Limitation Act 1939 (UK), contains words which, although different, are analogous to s 60G. At 588 his Honour posed the question: What is this action all about? The answer was that it was about an alleged breach of contract as a result of which the plaintiff lost the chance to recover his loss from the driver. That was not damages in respect of personal injuries. 
      
       
     53 Further, when an examination of the history of the introduction of s 60G into the Limitation Act in 1969 is undertaken, it is apparent that it is directed to personal injury claims by injured persons and not to claims for economic loss by third parties where that loss happens to consist, in whole or part, of damages for personal injury. 
      
       
     54 This construction of s 60G is assisted by the stated purpose in s 60F of the particular subdivision of the Act. It is to provide a procedure for ‘a further discretionary extension … where the plaintiff was unaware of the … cause of injury …’. Further, the sorts of discretionary factors to be considered by a court set forth in s 60I (referring back to s 60G), all concern a plaintiff’s situation of awareness. 
      
       
     55 Rolls Royce’s contention that s 60G may include a contract claim, such as the present, may have unforeseen consequences. For example, if a solicitor was sued for professional negligence in allowing a personal injury claim to get out of time, the limitation period would be 3 years (under s 18A) and not 6 years under s 14. 
      
       
     56 His Honour placed reliance on the definition of ‘breach of duty’ in s 11 as encompassing contract. However, the definition is directed to when the words are ‘used in relation to a cause of action for damages for personal injury’ and it is to be applied unless the context or subject matter otherwise indicate or require. Section 60G does not refer to a cause of action for damages for personal injury but to a cause of action ‘founded on negligence, nuisance or breach of duty, for damages for personal injury’. 
      
       
     57 In any event, even if the claim in contract is for ‘breach of duty’, it is still a claim for damages for breach of contract and not a claim for damages for personal injury. The injury to Rolls Royce was the economic loss suffered by reason of the breach of contract. It was not an action for damages for personal injury. The words ‘for damages for personal injury’ require the identification of the loss for which the damages are claimed. When this is done, it is clear that the loss is an economic one and not damages for personal injury. 
      
       
     58 Accordingly, it is my opinion that his Honour erred in granting the extension of time as he lacked the power to do so. The amendment to add the contract claim was impermissible. It follows that it is not strictly necessary to consider whether his Honour was correct to reject the claim in contract at the trial. 
      
       
     59 It also follows that it is unnecessary to consider James Hardie’s further Notice of Contention points regarding the contract claim. Nor to consider his Honour’s rejection of the contract claim itself, although I am of the opinion that Curtis J was correct to reject it. 
      
       
        
       Rolls Royce’s contribution claim against James Hardie 
        
       
     60 It is appropriate to start with the obvious statement that to set aside an apportionment of liability under s 5, it must be shown that the failure to properly exercise the discretion involved an apportionment which was unreasonable or plainly unjust, Oxley City Council v MacDonald [1999] NSWCA 126 at [55] referring to House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 525. 
      
       
     61 As Hayne J reminded us in Wynbergen v Hoyts Corporation Ltd (1997) 72 ALJR 65 at 68, the task involves comparison of the culpability of the parties and the relative importance of the acts of the parties in causing the damage. Further, the whole conduct of the each negligent party must be subjected to comparison, (Podrebersek v AIS (1985) 59 ALJR 492 at 494). 
      
       
     62 In Podrebersek the court said (at 493 – 494): 
      
       
        
         
         A finding on a question of apportionment is a finding upon a “question, not of principle or of positive findings of fact or law, but of proportion, of balance and relative emphasis, and of weighing different considerations. It involves an individual choice or discretion, as to which there may well be differences of opinion by different minds”.  
         
        
       
     63 The High Court recently reiterated this approach in Liftronic Pty Limited v Unver [2001] HCA 24 at [2], [33] and [64]. Kirby J noted the obviously very wide discretion in s 10 (cf s 5). The repository of power was the primary decision-maker and not the appellate court. His Honour referred to what was said in British Fame (Owners) v Macgregor (Owners) [1943] AC 197 at 201, endorsed by the court in Podrebersek. 
      
       
     64 To this brief discussion I should add a reference to James Hardie v Roberts [1999] NSWCA 314 at [89] – [92], per Sheller JA. 
      
       
     65 Curtis J found James Hardie to be a tortfeasor who would, if sued by the plaintiff, have been liable to him. James Hardie was in breach of its duty of care to Mr Hay in various ways and its breach was found to be causative of his injury. He described the breach as gross. 
      
       
     66 His Honour considered the responsibility of Rolls Royce. It was found to be in breach of its non-delegable duty as the employer of the plaintiff. Senior management of Rolls Royce were in breach of a duty to inform its supervisors at Wallerawang of the dangers of asbestos. Further, it was in breach of its statutory obligations under Regulation 73 of the Scaffolding and Lifts Act. Indeed, the conduct of Rolls Royce ‘fell far short of the standards expected of a reasonable employer’. Importantly, his Honour found that Rolls Royce had actual knowledge of the dangers of asbestos. The findings of knowledge by Rolls Royce were made in the context of a very detailed examination of the working conditions at Wallerawang. I will quote only one such finding that asbestos was ‘allowed to drift freely through the premises and accumulate on the floor only to be recirculated in the atmosphere’. Having noted the concession of Rolls Royce that it ought to have known of the dangers of asbestos, his Honour found that it was improbable that it did not actually know. It was most improbable that its design staff did not have actual knowledge of the dangers.  
      
       
     67 In an exhaustive analysis of the facts, Rolls Royce seeks to submit that there was insufficient evidentiary basis for his Honour to infer that it had actual knowledge of the dangers of asbestos dust at the relevant time. I would reject this. Rolls Royce is only able to appeal questions of law (s 32 Dust Diseases Tribunal Act). It is apparent that there was evidence upon which his Honour could draw the inference complained of and it may be noted that Rolls Royce conceded that it ought to have known of the dangers of asbestos. The inference drawn by his Honour was clearly open. It was made after a careful analysis of the evidence. In commenting on the failure of Rolls Royce to call any design staff, his Honour did not infringe Jones v Dunkel. His conclusion was only that their absence permitted an inference that it would not assist Rolls Royce in contending that it did not know of the risks of asbestos.  
      
       
     68 His Honour was engaged in a task involving weighing and balancing. Some may not agree with his emphasis on particular matters. Some may have come to a result other than 50/50 apportionment. However, that is not the point. His Honour found both parties in serious breach of their duties of care which each separately owed to the plaintiff and that the breaches of both were causative of the mesothelioma suffered by Mr Hay. I am unable to conclude that his Honour’s discretion miscarried. It cannot be concluded that the apportionment was unreasonable or plainly unjust. 
      
       
     69 His Honour’s conclusion was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         Upon a consideration of facts as I have reviewed them, I cannot find myself actually persuaded that either Rolls Royce or James Hardie was more, or less, responsible for the damage than the other. It may be that the conduct of James Hardie was more blameworthy but as against that, John Thompson had actual control of the environment in which Mr Hay worked and its failures had greater causal potency. I believe it appropriate to apportion responsibility 50 per cent as against James Hardie and 50 per cent as against John Thompson.  
          
         
        
       Indemnity 
        
       
     70 However Rolls Royce’s principal submission is that it is entitled to a complete indemnity under s 5. Both Rolls Royce and James Hardie were found to be tortfeasors independently at fault. Most leading texts on Torts conclude that it is only in circumstances where a tortfeasor is himself blameless, that an indemnity can be recovered. See for example Trindade and Cane, The Law of Torts in Australia (2nd Ed at 737). RTA v Fletcher [2001] NSWCA 63 at [53] is an example where the court refused to indemnify a party against all liability since it was not blameless. The most obvious illustration is with vicarious liability, Lister v Romford Ice and Cold Storage Co [1957] AC 555 and see McGrath v Fairfield Municipal Council (1985) 156 CLR 672 at 679 – 680. The court added in McGrath (at 680): 
      
       
        
         
         Unless that interpretation of “indemnity” would give the Act an operation that Parliament could not have intended, we would construe s.2(3) of the Act as applying to an employee’s liability under s.5(1)(c) to contribute the whole of the damages for which his employer is vicariously liable. However, Glass J.A. is surely right in saying that the Act would have an absurd operation if personal negligence on the part of the employer, which would limit an employer’s rights under s.5(1)(c) to a contribution of something less than the whole of the damages, were to make the Act inapplicable. If that were the Act’s operation the employer, on proof of his own negligence, would acquire a right to recover contribution from an employee although he could not claim an indemnity. In our opinion, that is not the operation to be attributed to that Act. 
         
        
       
     71 In Sinclair v William Arnott Pty Limited (1963) 64 SR (NSW) 88 at 95 the Full Court said: 
      
       
        
         
         But the present case is not a case of that kind. It is not a case in which one party, although not guilty of any actual fault itself, is nevertheless legally liable for the consequences of the actual fault of the other party. Here each party is liable for its own negligence, and its liability does not arise from the negligence of the other. There is no relevant contractual or other relationship between the two parties which would render it just and equitable that, as between them, one should bear the whole burden and the other should be exonerated. 
         
        
       
     72 Other exceptions where a complete indemnity have been allowed include Edwards v Joyce [1954] VLR 216, where a servant or agent committed a tort in bona fide execution of orders, and Burrows v Riorden [1899] 1 QB 816, where the claimant’s complicity was procured by the other parties fraud. See also s 7 of the WA statute. 
      
       
     73 On behalf of Rolls Royce Mr Hall submits that James Hardie had an overriding duty to warn Rolls Royce and to ensure that it took the necessary steps to negate the risk. This overriding duty is said to arise because James Hardie was manufacturing an inherently dangerous product. In other words, Rolls Royce’s breach of duty to the plaintiff was directly caused by James Hardie. He submits that this should translate to 100% apportionment or something very close to it. 
      
       
     74 I cannot accept this proposition. It amounts, in effect, to saying that James Hardie’s duty to Rolls Royce renders Rolls Royce’s negligence irrelevant or it is somehow cancelled out. Asbestos products themselves are not inherently dangerous products, rather it is the way in which they are used or processed which creates the danger, see Putt v James Hardie & Co Pty Limited (1998) 43 NSWLR 554 at 565. We are not here dealing with raw asbestos. In any event, it is unclear to what extent such a category still survives, see Muller v Lalic [2000] NSWCA 50 at [33]. 
      
       
     75 Further, if one applies Wynbergen, a contributory negligence case on s 10, to s 5, then one cannot have a 100% contribution. However, it must be conceded that it is not obvious that the reasoning of Hayne J in Wynbergen should be extended to contribution or indemnity under s 5. 
      
       
     76 In my view, what Curtis J was doing was an orthodox exercise of the discretionary power under s 5 to apportion liability. The facts as found, indeed the evidence as a whole, did not justify a 100% or complete indemnity or anything close to it. The court should not interfere with his Honour’s 50/50 apportionment. 
      
       
        
       Did settlement between Rolls Royce and Pacific Power bind the apportionment and was James Hardie able to claim contribution from Rolls Royce? 
        
       
     77 As mentioned earlier in these reasons, Rolls Royce and Pacific Power had settled in June 1994. Under the terms of the settlement, the two parties agreed to share the plaintiff’s judgment on a 50/50 basis. 
      
       
     78 It is submitted on behalf of Rolls Royce that this amounts to binding admissions by each defendant that the apportionment of liability between them was equal. Accordingly, it was not open to the Tribunal to contradict this apportionment between Rolls Royce and Pacific Power. It is maintained that the judgment did so because its split of 50/50 between James Hardie and Rolls Royce meant that the ultimate global apportionment or net result between all of the parties meant that Rolls Royce was liable for 39.8% but Pacific Power only 15%. Further, it is submitted that a 30/70 split between Pacific Power and James Hardie (by settlement) and a 50/50 split between Rolls Royce and James Hardie by his Honour, necessarily implied a 30/70 split between Pacific Power and Rolls Royce. But this, so it was said, directly contradicts the 50/50 split between Pacific Power and Rolls Royce arising out of the settlement. Rolls Royce accordingly submits that his Honour must have ignored the 50/50 settlement in June 1994 between Rolls Royce, Pacific Power and the plaintiff. 
      
       
     79 Furthermore, Mr Hall submits that as a pre-condition to a tortfeasor recovering contribution from another tortfeasor, the first tortfeasor had to be sued by the plaintiff and found liable to it by judgment or settlement. James Hardie was never a defendant and therefore never had its liability to the plaintiff determined. James Hardie accordingly did not qualify under s 5 to claim contribution against Rolls Royce. The appellant sought to demonstrate the alleged error by reference to some rather complex mathematics which I would require actuarial assistance to properly appreciate. It seems to me, however, that the result (of which Rolls Royce complains) arises out of the way in which the litigation was conducted and developed, including the various settlements. 
      
       
     80 Mr Hall candidly acknowledges that there is no authority that he knows of which supports his submission regarding James Hardie’s contribution claim against Rolls Royce. Further, he accepts that it is not uncommon for third parties to issue a third party claim in case liability is found against them. 
      
       
     81 Mr Hall highlights what he submits is the anomalous result in this case. However, as against that, it seems to me that it would be quite anomalous if a tortfeasor could not obtain contribution simply because of the plaintiff’s choice as to who he decided to sue as defendants. It would mean that a tortfeasor (who was not a defendant) but was joined by a defendant tortfeasor as a third party, could not join another tortfeasor and seek contribution. 
      
       
     82 In my opinion, the fact that the only defendants to the plaintiff’s claim (Rolls Royce and Pacific Power) agreed to equally share the plaintiff’s damages can not affect any third party proceedings or bind the apportionment exercise. The anomaly pointed to by Rolls Royce arose because it had entered into an agreement with Pacific Power when they were the only defendants to the plaintiff’s claim. 
      
       
     83 There is no doubt that James Hardie was a tortfeasor liable under s 5 for the plaintiff’s mesothelioma. If sued by the plaintiff, it would have been found to be liable. The essence of Pacific Power’s claim against James Hardie for contribution was proof of negligence by James Hardie as regards the plaintiff. Rolls Royce was also, according to James Hardie, a tortfeasor liable to the plaintiff by reason of the consent judgment in June 1994. I cannot see how matters pertaining to the settlement between Rolls Royce and Pacific Power can operate to bar James Hardie seeking contribution from Rolls Royce. The settlement of the plaintiff’s claim by Rolls Royce and Pacific Power does not prevent either of them from bringing a contribution claim against any other tortfeasor who would, if sued, have been liable, as indeed they did. Nor does it prevent any other tortfeasor, who would if sued have been liable, from bringing a contribution claim against any other tortfeasor who would if sued have been liable.  
      
       
     84 Simply put, the settlement between the two sole defendants, Rolls Royce and Pacific Power, cannot bind the apportionment with other tortfeasors. The task of the court is to assess what is just and equitable between the tortfeasors present in the particular contribution proceedings before the court. That is what his Honour did and I can see no error in his approach. 
      
       
     85 In particular, his Honour was correct to allow James Hardie to rely on its cross-claim for contribution against Rolls Royce.  
      
       
     86 The only relevant case cited to the court was Maxfield v Llewellyn (1961) 1 WLR 1119. The essence of the decision is that it is the duty of the court to apportion damages having regard to the parties before the court. Ormerod LJ noted a submission that the liability of anyone who could possibly be liable must be taken into account, including a possible defendant who was not a party to the action. 
      
       
     87 His Lordship said: 
      
       
        
         
         I think I should say here that this submission of Mr. King-Hamilton, interesting as it was, was not received with any very great sympathy by the various members of this court, and, indeed, it does appear, if the submission is right, to be a construction of the section which would give rise to many anomalies. That cannot be the proper construction of this section. It appears to me that the court must have regard to a person’s responsibility for the damage having regard to the parties who are before the court, whose share of the damage can be taken into account and who have had the opportunity of putting arguments for and against their share of blame and generally of being heard in the action. In those circumstances, for my part, I would reject Mr. King-Hamilton’s interesting submission and say that it is the duty of the court on finding more than one defendant liable to make an assessment of the contribution which each defendant should make according to his share of blameworthiness 
         
        
        
         
         . 
         
        
       
     88 Upjohn LJ was even more emphatic in his reasons for agreeing with Ormerod LJ, see 1123. 
      
       
     89 It follows from the above that the appeal of Rolls Royce should be dismissed. 
      
       
        
       The costs issues 
        
       
     90 James Hardie seeks leave to appeal on two aspects of his Honour’s decision as to costs. 
      
       
     91 The first question involves the effect of a Calderbank offer made by James Hardie to Rolls Royce on 4 June 1999. His Honour found that the offer was ineffective to protect James Hardie from costs. The offer was to pay Rolls Royce $129,500, being 70% of the amount which Rolls Royce paid to Mr Hay, and to also pay Rolls Royce’s costs of its cross-claim. The offer was open for 14 days but not accepted. Meanwhile a similar offer was made by James Hardie to Pacific Power, which was accepted on 24 June 1999. 
      
       
     92 On 22 July 1999 James Hardie gave Rolls Royce notice of its intention to claim from Rolls Royce contribution or indemnity under s 5 with respect to the $129,500 which it had paid to Pacific Power. On 16 August 1999 His Honour ruled that James Hardie was permitted to bring the claim, which ultimately succeeded to the extent of a 50% contribution.  
      
       
     93 His Honour said that overall Rolls Royce was the successful party. Accordingly, James Hardie was to pay its costs, excluding those relating to the contract claim. James Hardie argue that his Honour should have given effect to the Calderbank offer which Rolls Royce did not ‘better’. In rejecting James Hardie’s submission, his Honour said that Rolls Royce did not receive notice of the cross-claim by James Hardie in respect of the Pacific Power judgment until after the time for acceptance of the Calderbank offer had expired. This was a change of circumstance relevant to the discretion. 
      
       
     94 His Honour said that before the Calderbank offer expired, Rolls Royce did not have an informed opportunity to assess its chances because the cross-claim was brought at a later point of time. 
      
       
     95 I can see no error in his Honour’s decision on the failure of the Calderbank offer. The cross-claim by James Hardie was late and was not a circumstance at the time of the offer of 4 June 1999. Surely what must be relevant is the circumstances which exist at the time the offer is made? The cross-claim produced a change of circumstance which, if in existence as at 4 June 1999, would have been likely to have produced a different complexion to the litigation so far as Rolls Royce was concerned. 
      
       
     96 There is English authority which supports this – Gaskins v British Aluminium Co Ltd [1976] 1 QB 524 and Preotta v Times Newspaper Ltd [1991] 4 All ER 46. A similar stance was adopted by Mahoney AP in Fowdh v Fowdh (Unreported, NSWCA, 4 November 1993) cited by Curtis J. 
      
       
     97 Mahoney AP noted that after expiry of the offer and the time in which to accept it, two things emerged which significantly changed the situation. 
      
       
     98 He said: 
      
       
        
         
         … It is one thing for a plaintiff to present her evidence, make an offer of compromise, and to succeed at the trial on that evidence. In such a case, indemnity costs may be warranted. It is another thing for the plaintiff to present a case and make an offer of settlement, and then to succeed at the trial upon a relevantly different case. A plaintiff who has done that may not readily receive indemnity costs. I do not mean by this that minor differences between the case at offer and the case at trial will be of significance or that, if the difference be significant, a discretionary judgment for indemnity costs may not be given. But where the difference between the position at offer and the position at trial be as the Master assessed it to be, a decision to refuse indemnity costs may readily be understood. 
          
         
        
       
     99 See also Van Doore v Mendez (Unreported, NSWSC, 30 June 1997). 
      
       
     100 Whether Rolls Royce perceived the case as a test case does not alter the way in which the Calderbank offer should be viewed. 
      
       
     101 I can see no error by his Honour and would refuse leave to appeal on this aspect of the costs order made below. 
      
       
     102 The second aspect of costs which is in dispute concerns his Honour’s costs order which excepted the costs associated with the contract case brought by Rolls Royce, which James Hardie had succeeded upon, from the general costs order in favour of Rolls Royce. James Hardie argues that it should have been awarded the costs of that issue. 
      
       
     103 Curtis J referred to Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd v FAI General Insurance Co Ltd (Unreported NSWSC, 3 June 1998) and held that while the contract claim was clearly severable and Rolls Royce should not get its costs of the issue, it was not brought unreasonably and Rolls Royce ought not to have to pay James Hardie’s costs of the issue. 
      
       
     104 It is submitted that his Honour misapplied Hodgson CJ in Eq in Permanent Trustee in that the principle relied on, that the issue was raised reasonably and was not disproportionate to the whole case, was not relevant. It is claimed to be relevant only where multiple issues are raised by the successful party as alternative ways of supporting the claim. 
      
       
     105 Apart from the fact that the contract claim was an alternative way of supporting Rolls Royce’s claim, I do not see that the principle referred to by Hodgson J is inconsistent with the earlier statement about the costs of severable claims. His Honour was speaking in general terms. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         Apart from that consideration, in general terms I accept that if an issue is raised reasonably and is not disproportionate to the whole case, then normally the successful party should get his or her costs. However, particularly in relation to severable issues, the lesser the strength of the point raised and the greater the proportion it bears to the whole case, the more likely it is that the successful party may be deprived of costs; and if the Court comes to the view that it was unreasonable to raise the issue, then the successful party may have to pay the costs of that issue. 
          
         
        
       
     106 Again, I can see no error in his Honour’s approach or order. It was a proper and available exercise of the discretion. I would also refuse leave to appeal on this aspect of the costs order. 
      
       
        
        James Hardie v The State of New South Wales 
        
        
       Introduction 
        
       
     107 Pursuant to a claim for contribution under s 5, James Hardie sought to make the State of New South Wales liable. The essential basis of its claim was that the State, armed with various statutory powers and knowing of the dangers of asbestos, was in a position to prevent or minimise the risk of harm to Mr Hay through his exposure to asbestos at Wallerawang. It alleged that NSW failed in its duty to do so. Curtis J dismissed James Hardie’s claim. Before turning to the appeal of James Hardie against this dismissal, it is convenient to deal with a procedural issue which arose during the trial. 
      
       
        
       Refusal of amendment of James Hardie’s cross-claim 
        
       
     108 James Hardie sought leave to amend its cross-claim against the State to substitute the period of Mr Hay’s employment from 1953 to November 1961 from 1953 to 1958 (para 8). James Hardie submits that in refusing it the amendment on 11 August 1999, his Honour exercised his discretion so unreasonably as to warrant appellate intervention. 
      
       
     109 The amendment application arose in the following circumstances. On 21 June 1999 James Hardie informed the court that it had settled with Pacific Power. It then sought, and obtained, leave to amend the fourth cross-claim, as it then stood, on terms that James Hardie would be bound by particulars which it had previously given to NSW on 8 June 1999.  
      
       
     110 The leave which the court granted was exercised by James Hardie on 23 June 1999 when it included paragraphs 8 to 14 in the cross-claim against the State. Paragraph 9 introduced a new concept into the pleading, that of ‘the relevant period’, which period was stated to be between 1953 and 1958. James Hardie’s case against the State was postulated on NSW’s involvement at Wallerawang throughout that relevant period by reason of the activities of the Department of Labour and Industry and the Department of Public Health. It also relied on the co-existence of Elcom’s (Pacific Power) involvement in the construction of the power station during the same period. 
      
       
     111 On the eighth day of the trial (11 August 1999) the application to amend was made by James Hardie. It was first mentioned by James Hardie’s counsel after the conclusion of the cross-examination of Mr Trevor Jones from the Department of Health, who had visited the site in May 1958 and later reported on his visit. Rolls Royce had by then closed its case, having called three witnesses who gave evidence about the working conditions at Wallerawang, which overlapped with the period that the plaintiff worked there. James Hardie’s counsel opened at length but did not mention any amendment application and proceeded to call Mr Jones as its first witness. 
      
       
     112 No relevant cross-examination of any of the witnesses had been directed by NSW to any period after 1958. It is obvious that if the case had, from its outset, alleged that NSW was liable to the plaintiff up until November 1961, then the cross-examination would have been different. Further, the activities of the inspectors from the two government departments would have been pursued. The period between 1958 and 1961 would also have been subject of pre-trial inquiry and preparation by the State. The State may well have obtained information to cross-examine on events after 1958 and to call evidence of its own. 
      
       
     113 His Honour noted that senior counsel for NSW had indicated that forensic elections had been made in the preparation and conduct of the trial on the basis of the pleading and that such conduct may have been different if the longer period had been raised at the outset.  
      
       
     114 Bearing in mind the circumstances referred to earlier and that the trial had reached its eighth day, it cannot be said that his Honour’s discretion in refusing the amendment miscarried. 
      
       
     115 As there were weighty considerations in favour of refusal of the amendment, It was a proper exercise of the discretion. Granting an adjournment to NSW in exchange for the amendment was not a course that his Honour was bound to adopt in exercising his discretion. Nor does Queensland v J L Holdings Pty Limited (1997) 189 CLR 146 require that the amendment should have been granted. 
      
       
     116 Although his Honour’s discretion has not been shown to have miscarried, it also needs be said that it is difficult to see how this matter qualifies as a ‘point of law’ under s 32 of the Dust Diseases Tribunal Act. 
      
       
        
       Apportionment 
        
       
     117 I turn to the issue of apportionment because, as made clear in my summary of the trial judge’s findings (see paras 13 – 15), his Honour did not determine the issue of liability of the State. If the court does not see fit to intervene in his Honour’s decision on apportionment, it will be unnecessary to enter upon the debate on the liability of NSW. 
      
       
     118 What Curtis J said on apportionment was quite short, bearing in mind his Honour’s lengthy judgment. I have set forth most of the relevant section of the judgment in paragraph 15 of these reasons and will not repeat it. 
      
       
     119 It is important to set out the text of s 5(2) of the Act in order to emphasise that it contains two powers in the last part of the clause following the semi colon. That is the power to exempt a person from liability and of ‘complete indemnity’. The provision is as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         In any proceedings for contribution under this section the amount of the contribution recoverable from any person shall be such as may be found by the court to be just and equitable having regard to the extent of that person’s responsibility for the damage;  
         and the court shall have power to exempt any person from liability to make contribution, or to direct that the contribution to be recovered from any person shall amount to a complete indemnity.  
         [my emphasis] 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     120 In its written submission in chief James Hardie suggested that his Honour did not purport to exercise the exemption power. However, its written submission in reply and oral address accepts the State’s contention that his Honour was in fact purporting to utilise the exemption power in s 5(2).  
      
       
     121 A fair reading of what his Honour said leads me to accept that his Honour was purporting to exercise the exemption power in s 5(2) and I proceed on that basis. 
      
       
     122 However, James Hardie submits that his Honour had no power to do so because there are limits to the exemption power. It submits that the exemption power is not available where both tortfeasors are independently at fault. James Hardie relies on K v P (J third party) [1993] Ch 140 and dicta of Hayne J in Wynbergen.  
      
       
     123 Further, contrary to the submissions of the State, indemnity cases are relevant to be considered. Lastly, James Hardie submits that the discretion, which it concedes was being exercised by his Honour under s 5(2), miscarried in any event. 
      
       
     124 NSW submits that there is no statutory warrant to limit the exemption power (or for that matter the indemnification power) to cases where there is no independent fault by the tortfeasors. The power to exempt is unconfined by any criterion of independent fault and circumscribed only by what is assessed as ‘just and equitable having regard to the extent of that person’s responsibility for damage’. Section 5(2) is, of course, predicated on the basis that both James Hardie and NSW are liable to the plaintiff. 
      
       
     125 I should mention here that the argument about the use of the exemption power by his Honour assumes a finding of liability by the State to Mr Hay. In fact, his Honour made no finding of liability by the State because, as I mentioned earlier, he stayed from such a finding as being unnecessary to be made. 
      
       
     126 The State submits that the exemption power is discretionary and untrammelled, except to the extent mentioned above and to be found in the words of s 5(2). NSW maintains that it cannot be said that the discretion exercised by his Honour miscarried. Further, it submits that the discretionary decision is not amenable to appeal since it is not a point of law. 
      
       
     127 Notwithstanding the lengthy history of s 5(2), both in Australia and England, there are remarkably few reported cases on the power to exempt or grant complete indemnity. And even those cases provide little insight or guidance in the application of the powers. 
      
       
     128 The two powers are of course mirror images. On the one hand, to exempt a person (who would if sued have been liable) from making any contribution. On the other, that the contribution to be recovered from a tortfeasor be a complete or 100% indemnity. Therefore, cases on both exemption and complete indemnity may be relevant. 
      
       
     129 The starting point must be that the courts have repeatedly emphasised that the discretion in s 5 (as in s 10) is a very wide one. Most recently this was re-emphasised in Liftronic (a case on s 10). Gleeson CJ repeated the often quoted passage in Podrebersek, referred to earlier in para 62 of these reasons. As I have already mentioned (para 63), Kirby J emphasised the very wide discretion and the limited role of an appellate court with respect to a miscarriage of the exercise of the discretionary power. 
      
       
     130 One difference between s 10 and s 5 to be kept in mind is that s 10 contains no equivalent to the complete indemnity and exemption powers in s 5(2). This means that care should be taken in considering the remarks of Hayne J in Wynbergen [at 69] that it was not possible to have 100% contributory negligence of a plaintiff, no matter how culpable he or she was. 
      
       
     131 Likewise the comments of Sheller JA in James Hardie v Roberts [at 91] that the same principles apply to s 5(1)(c) as do to s 10. His Honour was, of course, not directing himself to the part of s 5(2) which refers to exemption and complete indemnity. 
      
       
     132 Turning to the reported cases on exemption and indemnity, some of which have already been referred to (paras 70 – 72) it will be noted that many deal with the situation of vicarious liability. There must be doubt that they would necessarily be decided in the same fashion today and in NSW the principle in Lister v Romford Ice has been abrogated by statute. In that case, Viscount Simonds (579 - 580) saw no reason why the employer should not be entitled to recover contribution from its employee ‘to the extent of 100%’. He considered Ryan v Fildes [1938] 3 All ER 517 to have been rightly decided. Lord Morton of Henryton was of the same view (584 - 585). Their Lordships were a bare majority on the point and the decision has been much criticised. 
      
       
     133 In Ryan v Fildes Tucker J found that a schoolteacher, who had exceeded reasonable and lawful correction in punishing a pupil, and her employer, the school managers, were jointly liable to the plaintiff. His Honour noted that the provision in the Law Reform (Married Women and Tortfeasors) Act 1935 (in almost identical terms to our s 5(2)), contained the exemption and complete indemnity powers.  
      
       
     134 He said at (524 –525): 
      
       
        
         
         That is to say, two persons having been found legally liable to pay,  
         prima facie 
         , the whole of the damage, one of them, for reasons which may appear sufficient to the court, may be exempted altogether from his liability. On the other hand, although the section is dealing with contribution, it is said in terms that the court may direct that a contribution to be recovered from any persons shall amount to a complete indemnity. It is clearly contemplated in that case that a contribution may amount to 100 per cent contribution, and may become in effect an indemnity. 
         
        
       
     135 In ordering contribution amounting to a complete indemnity, Tucker J recorded that a discretion was involved and different facts may require a different result. 
      
       
     136 Higgins v William Inglis & Son Pty Ltd [1978] 1 NSWLR 649 is a case closer to home. The judgment of Glass JA (Moffitt P and Reynolds JA agreeing) dealt with the question of contribution or indemnity under s 5(2) claimed by the owner of a bull who had savaged a man at a livestock auction, against the auctioneer. 
      
       
     137 His Honour said (at 656): 
      
       
        
         
         Having regard to the evidence that the owner’s son, when making delivery of the bull made full disclosure of its dangerous tendencies, I do not think that any responsibility for the ensuing damage can be attached to the owner. I would, accordingly, propose that he recover a full indemnity from the auctioneer in respect of the damages which he is liable to pay to the plaintiff.  
         
        
       
     138 In Sherras v Van der Maat (1989) 1 Qd R 114 Thomas J (at 117 – 118) endorsed a concession made by a defendant, who had been found to have negligently caused the plaintiff’s injuries, that it bear a 100% contribution. The liability of the other defendants arose not from negligence but from absolute statutory duties owed by them. 
      
       
     139 Ward Enterprises Pty Ltd v Ahern [2000] NSWCA 184 involved an apportionment appeal. The trial judge had applied a 50/50 apportionment between two tortfeasors. All of the court agreed that this could not stand and the majority (Mason P and Clarke AJA) substituted an 85/15 split. Clarke JA said that he was not persuaded that the principal tortfeasor (TNT) should bear 100% of the damages. Meagher JA dissented on this issue. He said that all the negligence was by TNT and Wards was only liable on an insurance basis. Therefore TNT should indemnify Wards to 100%. 
      
       
     140 I have mentioned the reliance by the appellant on K v P (J third party). However, I do not think that the case provides much assistance. It is however a case which deals with the exemption power, rather than complete indemnity. A third party sought to be exempted from liability to make a contribution. The summons was premature and meant that the court had to assume that the defendant would be found guilty of conspiracy and fraud (alleged by the plaintiffs) and also that the third party would be found to be negligent as regards the plaintiffs. 
      
       
     141 In dismissing the third party’s summons, Ferris J said at 150: 
      
       
        
         
         If, as I must assume for present purposes, the plaintiffs have a good cause of action in professional negligence against the third party, then it must be at least possible, if not indeed likely, that the damages recoverable by the plaintiffs from the third party would include damages under at least some of these heads. I can see that the third party would have a cogent argument that even if he were liable to compensate the plaintiffs in respect of these matters it would not be just and equitable to require him to make a contribution to the third defendant’s liability. But what the court has to consider is the third party’s responsibility for the damages in question. Once it is assumed that the third party would be liable to the plaintiffs for damages of a particular kind, it must follow that he has  
         some 
          responsibility for those damages. In order to carry out the exercise required by s 2(1) it would be essential, in my judgment, to evaluate the relative responsibilities of the third defendant and the third party. I do not see how this can be done without a trial of both the action and the claim to contribution. Certainly I feel unable at this stage to say, with the degree of certainty necessary to make a striking-out order, that the third party will inevitably be exempted from making contribution under s 2 (2). 
         
        
       
     142 The statement by Trindade and Cane, referred to earlier in para 70, that a complete indemnity cannot be recovered where both tortfeasors are independently at fault needs to be examined. There is no authority that I can find which expressly says so. One can accept that if a person is blameless, but held to be legally liable for the tort of another, a full indemnity may be allowed, see eg. Pantalone v Alaouie (1989) 18 NSWLR 119 at 141. But we are here dealing with a wide discretion which should not be lightly encroached. The discretion should not be construed so as to be subject to a limitation which is not apparent in the ordinary meaning of the words conferring the power. See Patton v Buchanan Borehole Collieries Pty Ltd (1992 – 1993) 178 CLR 14 at 17, 23 and 29, also Knight v F.P. Special Assets Ltd (1992) 174 CLR 178 at 205. 
      
       
     143 In my view, there is no principle of law that where two tortfeasors are independently at fault, there can never be a complete indemnity or exemption. 
      
       
     144 Turning to the exercise of the discretion in the instant case, although Curtis J gave sparse reasons for granting the exemption, the context in which he so found must be taken into account. In giving his conclusion on the exemption, a large number of earlier findings by his Honour regarding James Hardie’s culpability must have been taken into account. I will mention some of his Honour’s findings: 
      
       
        
       . The appalling conditions in which the men worked at Wallerawang was known to James Hardie, whose officers were on occasions present on site.  
        
        
       . James Hardie had a duty to Mr Hay to protect him by providing a warning label on its products and bring the dangers to the attention of his immediate supervisors. James Hardie had actual knowledge of the dangers.  
        
        
       . The workers on the site remained ignorant of the risks of asbestos products and James Hardie had a duty to address this.  
        
        
       . As manufacturer of the asbestos products, James Hardie had an acute and unique perception of the gravity of the risk.  
        
        
       . James Hardie’s duty to Mr Hay was conditioned by his vulnerability and the ignorance of his supervisors, while James Hardie had actual knowledge and the power to reduce the imbalance.  
        
        
       . The failure of James Hardie to give a specific warning to Rolls Royce setting out the reality and gravity of the risks created by its products was causative of the plaintiff’s mesothelioma.  
        
        
       . James Hardie had a duty to bring home to those affected by the asbestos in its products that the risk was neither improbable nor remote. James Hardie’s breach of duty was causative of Mr Hay’s injury.  
        
        
       . James Hardie’s failure to fulfil its duty fell far short of the standard required of a reasonable man as to be almost inexplicable.  
        
        
       . James Hardie’s failure to include warnings with its products was because it was concerned that ‘ignorance and fear’ in the public would be increased by the perception that the products were sufficiently dangerous to require warning and careful use.  
        
        
       . James Hardie made a conscious management decision to take no steps to warn end users of the serious risks associated with use of its asbestos products. It did not do so because this may have adversely affected its market.  
        
        
       . The standard of care required by a manufacturer and distributor of a product it knows to be potentially lethal is so high as to require considerable effort and expense to discharge that duty. 
        
        
       . James Hardie made no effort and expended no expense in discharging its duty to the plaintiff.  
        
       
     145 These conclusions may be contrasted with the State’s responsibility for the damage to the plaintiff. The highest his Honour stated this was in not following-up the Jones report in 1958, and alerting its inspectors to the dangers of visible concentrations of asbestos. According to his Honour, Mr Slade, an inspector, should have arranged for a follow-up of the Jones report and it was careless of him not to do so. However, his Honour found the circumstances known to Mr Slade were not such as to enliven the duty to exercise the statutory powers contained in s 15 of the Scaffolding and Lifts Act. 
      
       
     146 Again, it must be emphasised that his Honour did not find that NSW had breached its duty of care although the exemption finding must assume liability by the State. On one approach his Honour said it was liable, but on another it may not be. I have summarised these parts of his judgment in paras 13 and 14 earlier. His Honour added that it was unnecessary to decide the ‘difficult question’ (of the State’s liability) because of his views on apportionment. 
      
       
     147 In my opinion, what his Honour said on apportionment does not reveal any miscarriage of the discretion, particularly when read in the light of the findings made earlier about the extreme culpability of James Hardie. It was not an error for his Honour to say that James Hardie created the danger which NSW merely failed to avoid. Further, the evidence entitled him to refer to James Hardie being heedless of the dangers that it knew were created by its products and, at the same time, continuing to make profits from their sale. 
      
       
     148 It cannot be said that Curtis J was not entitled to conclude that, having regard to NSW’s responsibility for the damage to the plaintiff, it would not be just or equitable that the State contribute to that loss. 
      
       
     149 At the very least, bearing in mind the very wide discretion, it cannot be said that the discretion miscarried. It was open to his Honour to exempt the State from contribution under s 5(2). This conclusion means ultimately that no point of law arises under s 32 of the Dust Diseases Tribunal Act. 
      
       
     150 As a result, it is unnecessary to consider the arguments about whether the State was in breach of its duty, fascinating as they may be. 
      
       
     151 The appeal should be dismissed with costs.

     153 FITZGERALD AJA: The circumstances giving rise to these proceedings are set out in the reasons for judgment of Stein JA, which enable me to be brief. I will use the same abbreviations as his Honour. 
      
       
     154 Between 1955 and 1961, Rolls Royce purchased asbestos products from James Hardie for use in Rolls Royce’s construction of the Wallerawang Power Station for Pacific Power. Mr Warren Hay, who worked for Rolls Royce on that project between 1958 and 1961, contracted mesothelioma from asbestos dust and fibre to which he was exposed in the course of his employment. 
      
       
     155 Mr Hay sued Rolls Royce and Pacific Power in the Dust Diseases Tribunal. On 27 June 1994, consent judgments, each for $185,000, were entered in Mr Hay’s favour against Rolls Royce and Pacific Power. Rolls Royce’s claim against Pacific Power for contribution under s 5 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1996 (the “Law Reform Act”) was dismissed by consent. 
      
       
     156 Each of Rolls Royce and Pacific Power then prosecuted a cross-claim for contribution against James Hardie under s 5 of the Law Reform Act. Rolls Royce only commenced its cross-claim against James Hardie on 3 June 1994. Pacific Power did not commence its cross-claim against James Hardie until 27 June 1994.  
      
       
     157 On 13 December 1996, a claim for damages for breach of contract was added to Rolls Royce’s cross-claim against James Hardie pursuant to leave granted by the trial judge. 
      
       
     158 On 4 June 1999, James Hardie made a Calderbank offer of $129,500 to each of Rolls Royce and Pacific Power. 
      
       
     159 Pacific Power accepted the offer, and on 24 June 1999, a consent judgment for $129,500 was entered in its favour against James Hardie. James Hardie recovered $20,000 of that amount from another company, Wallaby Grip. 
      
       
     160 James Hardie subsequently cross-claimed against Rolls Royce for contribution under s 5 of the Law Reform Act. 
      
       
     161 The trial judge held that Rolls Royce and James Hardie were equally responsible for Mr Hay’s damage and ordered each to pay the other half of the amount for which it had been held liable (less the amount recovered by James Hardie from Wallaby Grip), resulting in a net verdict of $ 37,500 in favour of Rolls Royce. Rolls Royce’s contract claim against James Hardie was dismissed. 
      
       
     162 The trial judge also dismissed a claim by James Hardie for contribution from the State of New South Wales under s 5 of the Law Reform Act. 
      
       
        
       Rolls Royce’s contract claim against James Hardie 
        
       
     163 In its appeal to the Court, Rolls Royce argued that its contract claim against James Hardie should not have been dismissed. James Hardie filed a Notice of Contention. One of the bases on which it sought to uphold the trial judge’s dismissal of Rolls Royce’s contract claim was that his Honour erred in giving Rolls Royce leave to add that claim because it was out of time and there was no power to extend the time. 
      
       
     164 In this Court, Rolls Royce accepted that an extension of time was necessary and that there was no power to extend time except under cl 4(1) of Schedule 5 of the Limitation Act 1969 which extends the operation of s 60G of the Act. 
      
       
     165 Section 60G provides that it only applies “to a cause of action that accrues on or after 1 September 1990, founded on negligence, nuisance or breach of duty, for damages for personal injury …”. However, by clause 4(1) of Schedule 5, “[s]ection 60G also applies to a cause of action, founded on negligence, nuisance or breach of duty, being a cause of action that accrued before 1 September 1990 …”. It was not disputed that, if Rolls Royce had a claim for damages for breach of contract against James Hardie, it was a “cause of action … founded on breach of duty” (Limitation Act, s 11) that had accrued before 1 September 1990. Rolls Royce argued that its claim need not be, but in fact was, “for damages for personal injury” within the meaning of s 60G. According to Rolls Royce, since James Hardie’s breach of its contract with Rolls Royce caused Rolls Royce’s liability to Mr Hay for damages for personal injury, Rolls Royce’s claim against James Hardie for damages for breach of contract was “for damages for personal injury”. Rolls Royce submitted that “for” should be read as equivalent to “in respect of” (State Government Insurance Office v Crittenden (1966) 117 CLR 412), and, when so read, applied to Rolls Royce’s contract claim against James Hardie (Genders v Government Insurance Office of NSW (1959) 102 CLR 363). See also Rheem Australia Ltd v Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Ltd (1984) 2 NSWLR 370. In effect, Rolls Royce argued that James Hardie’s liability to it for damages for breach of contract is a liability “for” i.e. “in respect of”, “damages for personal injury“, so that Rolls Royce’s cause of action against James Hardie was “a cause of action … for damages for personal injury”. 
      
       
     166 There is a threshold question concerning whether the requirement in s 60G that the cause of action be “for damages for personal injury” applies when s 60G is applicable, not because of its own terms but because of clause 4(1) of Schedule 5. Rolls Royce’s submission that, when (as in this case) reliance is placed on clause 4(1), there is no requirement that the cause of action must be for “damages for personal injury” is inconsistent with the manifest purpose of the material portion of the Limitation Act and, to my mind, with its structure and language. When cl 4(1) of Schedule 4 is notionally added as a further subsection to s 60G, it would be extremely artificial to read it as applying to causes of action other than causes of action for damages for personal injury, especially in the context of the other provisions of Part 3 Division 3 Subdivision 3 of the Limitation Act, including s 60 I: see, generally, Dedousis v The Water Board (1994) 181 CLR 171. 
      
       
     167 Rolls Royce’s other argument that its claim for damages for breach of contract is “for damages for personal injury” within the meaning of s 60G should also be rejected. What is properly described as “a cause of action … for damages for personal injury” for that purpose depends on the particular context of Part 3 Division 3 Subdivision 3. Rolls Royce’s claim for damages equivalent to its liability to Mr Hay for his personal injury is not “a cause of action … for damages for personal injury” in that context. The only personal injury was suffered by Mr Hay. Each of Rolls Royce and James Hardie is liable to Mr Hay “for damages for personal injury”. James Hardie was also liable to Rolls Royce for a breach of contract between them which caused Rolls Royce’s liability to Mr Hay. James Hardie’s liability to Rolls Royce was not “for” the material injury, namely, that suffered by Mr Hay. 
      
       
     168 I agree with Stein JA that Rolls Royce’s appeal against the rejection of its contract claim against James Hardie should be dismissed. 
      
       
        
       The claims for contribution 
        
       
     169 So far as presently material, s 5 of the Law Reform Act provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Proceedings against and contribution between joint and several tort-feasors 
         
        
        
         
         (1) Where damage is suffered by any person as a result of a tort … 
         
        
        
        
         
          
           
           ……………………………………………………………. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
           (c) any tort-feasor liable in respect of that damage may recover contribution from any other tort-feasor who is, or would if sued have been, liable in respect of the same damage, whether as a joint tort-feasor or otherwise, so, however, that no person shall be entitled to recover contribution under this section from any person entitled to be indemnified by him in respect of the liability in respect of which the contribution is sought. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (2) In any proceedings for contribution under this section the amount of the contribution recoverable from any person shall be such as may be found by the court to be just and equitable having regard to the extent of that person’s responsibility for the damage; and the court shall have power to exempt any person from liability to make contribution, or to direct that the contribution to be recovered from any person shall amount to a complete indemnity. 
         
        
        
         
         …………………………………………………………….”. 
         
        
       
     170 Because of the manner in which this case has been conducted, the other parties’ contributions have not been determined by reference to their respective responsibilities overall for Mr Hay’s damage but by reference to the respective responsibilities of Rolls Royce and Pacific Power as between themselves, the respective responsibilities of Pacific Power and James Hardie as between themselves, the respective responsibilities of Rolls Royce and James Hardie as between themselves, and the respective responsibilities of James Hardie and the State as between themselves: cf Maxfield v Llewellyn (1961) 1 WLR 1119. This is illustrated by the contribution issues which were debated in the Court. James Hardie was a party to two separate disputes with respect to contribution, one with Rolls Royce and one with the State. Any change to the judgment below in either dispute had the potential to affect the ultimate outcome in the other dispute. For example, if the State was held liable to James Hardie, that would reduce James Hardie’s liability and the total amount for which it and Rolls Royce would be liable between them. The exemption of the State from any obligation to make contribution therefore adversely affected Rolls Royce as well as James Hardie. However, although the proceedings in this Court were all listed for hearing on the same date and proceeded in an order which was acceptable to the parties, Rolls Royce did not seek to support James Hardie’s claim for contribution from the State. 
      
       
     171 The amount for which the trial judge gave judgment in favour of Rolls Royce against James Hardie was based on the amounts of the respective judgments against them and his Honour’s conclusion that, as between them, it was just and equitable having regard to their respective responsibilities for Mr Hay’s damage that each should contribute half of the total amount for which they were liable. His Honour’s dismissal of James Hardie’s claim against the State of New South Wales appears to have been based upon his conclusion that, even if the State would have been liable to Mr Hay if he had sued it, as between James Hardie and the State it was just and equitable, having regard to their respective responsibilities for Mr Hay’s damage, that the State be exempted from liability. These conclusions have been challenged in this Court. 
      
       
     172 The High Court and this Court (see, e.g. Dunnet v Brennan [2000] NSWCA 211; Fitzgerald v Dansey [2001] NSWCA 339) have repeatedly reaffirmed the principles which restrict an appellate court’s power to review a trial judge’s decision on apportionment. Despite those principles, the Court is regularly asked to change an apportionment determined on trial. It is insufficient for an appellant to persuade an appeal court that, when all material factors are considered, the trial judge’s apportionment is different from that which the appeal court would have decided. An appeal court is not entitled to interfere if the trial judge’s apportionment was reasonably open. 
      
       
        
       James Hardie’s contribution claim against the State of New South Wales 
        
       
     173 Section 5 (1)(c) of the Law Reform Act recognises that one of two or more tortfeasors liable in respect of the same damage may be entitled to be indemnified by another of those tortfeasors: see e.g. Redken Laboratories (Australia) Pty Ltd v Docker [2000] NSWCA 100. Section 5(2) provides that one tortfeasor may be required to indemnify another when that is just and equitable having regard to their respective responsibilities for the damage for which each is, or if sued would be, liable. Section 5 (2) also provides that one tortfeasor may be exempted from liability to make contribution when that is just and equitable. There is no implicit limitation in s 5 (2) which restricts the power to order indemnification or exemption when each tortfeasor is independently at fault. The question is the same in all cases, namely, what is just and equitable having regard to the extent of each tortfeasor’s responsibility for the damage. 
      
       
     174 Although (on the assumption on which I am presently considering this aspect of its dispute with James Hardie) the State was separately negligent and by its negligence caused Mr Hay damage, in a practical sense it was the negligence of James Hardie which was the operative negligence. The State’s (assumed) negligence was its failure to prevent James Hardie’s negligence from causing damage to Mr Hay. While the trial judge was not bound in the circumstances to exempt the State from any liability to make contribution to James Hardie in respect of its liability, it was open to his Honour to do so: cf Redken, at para 72. 
      
       
     175 In the circumstances, it is unnecessary for me to discuss the trial judge’s refusal to allow James Hardie to expand its claim against the State other than to say that I agree with Stein JA that James Hardie failed to demonstrate any error by his Honour on a point of law within the meaning s 32 of the Dust Diseases Tribunal Act 1989. 
      
       
     176 I agree with Stein JA that James Hardie’s appeal against the rejection of its claim for contribution from the State of New South Wales should be dismissed. 
      
       
        
       Contribution claims between Rolls Royce and James Hardie 
        
       
     177 The remaining contribution claims are those between Rolls Royce and James Hardie. 
      
       
     178 One of Rolls Royce’s arguments was that James Hardie was not entitled to claim contribution from Rolls Royce because James Hardie was not a “tortfeasor liable” in respect of Mr Hay’s damage since it had not even been sued by him. The liability in respect of which James Hardie sought contribution from Rolls Royce was James Hardie’s liability to Pacific Power to contribute in respect of Pacific Power’s liability to Mr Hay. 
      
       
     179 There appear to be at least two simple answers to this unmeritorious argument. One is that James Hardie’s liability to Pacific Power is a liability “in respect of” Mr Hay’s damage: cf Crittenden, Genders and Rheem, the cases relied on by Rolls Royce to support an extension of time for its contract claim against James Hardie. The second is that it is just and equitable (having regard to their respective responsibilities for Mr Hay’s damage) for James Hardie’s liability to Pacific Power to be taken into account in determining the amount that it should be ordered to pay Rolls Royce in respect of its contribution claim against James Hardie. Irrespective of whether James Hardie successfully claimed contribution from Rolls Royce or James Hardie’s liability to Pacific Power was merely brought to account in James Hardie’s defence of Rolls Royce’s claim for contribution against James Hardie, the amount payable by James Hardie to Rolls Royce would be the same. 
      
       
     180 Another of Rolls Royce’s arguments was based on the consent judgments between Mr Hay and Rolls Royce, Mr Hay and Pacific Power, Rolls Royce and Pacific Power and Pacific Power and James Hardie. According to Rolls Royce, the apportionment between Rolls Royce and James Hardie determined by the trial judge was inconsistent with those judgments, which either entitled Rolls Royce to an order that James Hardie indemnify it or to a different apportionment between Rolls Royce and James Hardie which was consistent with the consent judgments. 
      
       
     181 Although superficially more complex, on analysis this argument seemed to involve the following steps. Judgments between Mr Hay, Rolls Royce and Pacific Power established that Rolls Royce and Pacific Power were equally liable for Mr Hay’s damage, and the judgment between Pacific Power and James Hardie established that their respective liabilities were in the proportion 30% and 70%. Taken in conjunction, therefore, the judgments established that the respective liabilities of Rolls Royce and James Hardie were 30% and 70%, and the contribution which James Hardie was ordered to make to Rolls Royce should be increased accordingly. 
      
       
     182 It is unnecessary to decide whether the judgments between Mr Hay, Rolls Royce and Pacific Power establish that Rolls Royce and Pacific Power were equally liable for Mr Hay’s damages. The material judgments were consent judgments between those parties which were entered without James Hardie’s consent. Indeed, the time for James Hardie to plead to Rolls Royce’s cross-claim had not expired when the consent judgments were entered between Mr Hay, Rolls Royce and Pacific Power, and Pacific Power only commenced its cross-claim against James Hardie on the day when the consent judgments were entered. Other considerations aside, even if it was legitimate to enter consent judgments in those circumstances, it would not be just and equitable to hold that James Hardie is bound by them in its contribution dispute with Rolls Royce: cf Insurance Exchange of Australia v Dooley & Anor [2000-2001] 50 NSWLR 222. 
      
       
     183 Once this point is reached, the only question is whether the trial judge’s apportionment was reasonably open. I agree with Stein JA that it was. 
      
       
     184 I also agree with his Honour that Rolls Royce’s appeal should be dismissed. 
      
       
        
       Costs 
        
       
     185 The other members of the Court would refuse James Hardie leave to appeal in respect of the costs orders made between Rolls Royce and James Hardie. There is no purpose to be served in more than a brief statement of the reasons for my disagreement. 
      
       
     186 Rolls Royce received less on its claim for contribution and less overall than it had earlier been offered by James Hardie in a Calderbank letter. Further, Rolls Royce’s contract claim was dismissed. Finally, James Hardie succeeded on its claim for contribution. 
      
       
     187 In the circumstances, James Hardie was entitled to the costs of the contribution proceedings between it and Rolls Royce. 
      
       
     188 In summary I would make the following orders: 
      
       
        
       (a)  
       Rolls Royce v James Hardie 
        
        
       Appeal dismissed with costs. 
        
        
       (b)  
       James Hardie v State of New South Wales 
        
        
       Appeal dismissed with costs. 
        
        
       (c)  
       James Hardie v Rolls Royce 
        
        
       Leave to appeal granted, appeal allowed with costs including the costs of the application for leave, order that Rolls Royce pay James Hardie’s costs of the contribution proceedings between those parties. 
        
       
     189 DAVIES AJA: I agree with Stein JA.

       Judgment 
       
     1 WOOD CJ AT CL: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed upon him by Judge J B Phelan, in the District Court at Wollongong, on 11 July 2000.  
     2 His Honour had before him, on that occasion, an appeal from the Local Court at Wollongong, against a sentence of six months imprisonment for breach of a Community Service Order, which had been imposed for an offence of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm; as well as one count on an indictment for a charge of supplying the prohibited drug methylamphetamine. 
     3 In relation to the last mentioned matter, seven further offences were taken into account on a form 1, comprising offences of driving while disqualified, cultivation of cannabis plants, drive in a manner dangerous, negligent driving, driving an unregistered and unlicensed vehicle, and negligent driving. The six month sentence imposed in the Local Court was confirmed. For the count on the indictment, taking into account the form 1 offences, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for two years and six months, with a non parole period of eighteen months, each to commence upon expiry of the six months term, ie upon 4 November 2000. 
     4 As a consequence of this further sentence, and the confirmation of the sentence below, the applicant is due to serve a total custodial period of two years which was due to expire on 3 May 2002, with an additional period subject to supervision on probation of twelve months.  
     5 Two grounds of appeal are relied upon the first of which was raised only during the hearing of the appeal. It was to the effect that having regard to the small quantity and low purity of methylamphetamine involved, the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 
     6 The offence was detected during a police operation which had targeted the Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) car park at Warrawong. At about 3pm. on 10 August 1998, the applicant was seen to drive into the car park and speak to a person who had been waiting there for some time. When police made their presence known the pedestrian fled. The applicant’s motor vehicle was searched, and three plastic packets containing pink powder were observed. When tested, they were found to contain 9.5 gms of the prohibited substance with a purity of 2.5%. the indictable quantity for methylamphetamine, it may be noted, is 3 gms. 
     7 The offence here involved cannot be dismissed as trivial, as the applicant sought to argue. The sentence imposed needs to be considered in the light of the number of matters taken into account on the form 1. Of those, the offences involving the cultivation of cannabis plants and drive in a manner dangerous, were particularly serious.  
     8 In sentencing the applicant, his Honour was justified in properly reflecting the totality of the criminality that was involved in relation to the count on the indictment, and the form 1 matters, in accordance with the decision in R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368. 
     9 Having regard additionally to the unsatisfactory criminal history of the applicant, which revealed a consistent pattern of offending, dating back to 1994, and disobedience to various Court orders, constituting a record which his Honour fairly described as “rather appalling”, there is no merit in this ground.  
     10 I turn next to the circumstance disclosed in an affidavit sworn by the applicant to the effect, that since being taken into custody, he has developed a condition of idiopathic epilepsy. He says that this condition has led him, since December 2000, to suffer fits involving a loss of consciousnesses, and on occasions minor injuries. From March 2001, he has been prescribed medication, including Dilantin, Deseryl, Epilim 500 and Tegeratol. 
     11 Some of these medications have disagreed with him, and they have not been entirely successful in preventing his fits. This condition the applicant has sworn, in an affidavit filed for the purpose of the appeal, had not manifested itself at the time he appeared for sentence. 
     12 In a report prepared for the purposes of this application, Dr. John Lawson, a consultant physician, has advised: 
      
       
        
        “It appears that a diagnosis of Idiopathic epilepsy has been made. In this condition a patient is affected by unpredictable seizure episodes where, in the case of grand mal epilepsy, there is loss of consciousness as well as repeated tonic/clonic body and limb movements and possibly loss of control of bladder and bowel. The muscle contractions occurring during epileptic seizure are mostly violent, very forceful and totally uncontrolled. There is a significant risk of injury in the absence of assistance and first aid. Injury may result from falling or be as a result of body and limbs forcibly striking walls, floor or other objects Damage to teeth and aspiration of fluid or vomitus may occur resulting in pneumonia and other, more severe, respiratory affects including respiratory arrest. Many epileptics experience an aura which may provide some warning of an impending fit, but this is usually of brief duration and may lead rapidly to the onset of seizure and loss of consciousness, which would prevent the patient obtaining assistance. Most seizures of the grand mal type are followed by a period of impaired consciousness during which the patient requires supervision and rest. 
        
       
       
        
        Epilepsy is a serious medical condition which requires regular medication and supervision regarding the adequacy of the treatment with, in many cases, assessment of blood levels of the anticonvulsant treatments. The medication can be taken daily in some cases, but with some of the anticonvulsant treatments twice or three times daily may be required. Conditions which can aggravate the severity of epilepsy include sustained anxiety, further injury and febrile illness. 
        
       
       
        
        It is probable that conditions of prison will engender levels of anxiety which would increase the risk of seizure. 
        
       
       
        
        Considering the conditions of imprisonment it would be difficult, in my opinion and experience, to provide appropriate supervision and immediate first aid as required to the epileptic prisoner. There would be unnecessary increased risks of injury and serious consequence of failure to supervise the prisoner during the epileptic seizures. After the fit impaired consciousness and possible altered behaviour may cause difficulties in relationship to another present inmates. It could be difficult to guarantee appropriate administration of anticonvulsant medication in the cell. Supervision of appropriate blood tests and probable treatment for any other inter-current illness, particularly febrile episodes, would prove a problem in the average prison environment.” 
        
       
       
        
       
     13 The Crown opposed the application upon the basis that proof of the onset of an illness, which was not evident at the time of sentencing, provides no basis for appellate intervention. While it accepts that evidence of a worsening of a condition, which was known to exist before an offender was sentenced, can properly attract appellate intervention, of which the case of R v F NSWCCA 21 May 1998, and R v Azar [2000] NSW CCA 26 provide examples, the proper remedy, in a case such as the present, it submits, lies with the Executive. 
     14 This principle was said to derive from observations in the judgment of this Court in R v L NSW CCA 17 June 1996 at p7, and of Carruthers J, in Jones (1993) 70 A Crim R 449 at 456/457. In the first of these decisions the Court said: 
      
       
       “The fact that an offender suffers from an illness does not necessarily mean that a prison sentence should not be imposed, or that the sentence should be less than the circumstances of the case would otherwise require.  
       R v Vachalec (1 
       981) 1 NSWLR 351 per Street CJ at 353-4. If a prisoner’s condition deteriorates during the course of the sentence such that his or her release ought to be permitted on humanitarian grounds, the executive is empowered to deal with the situation. Section 53 of the Sentencing Act 1989, preserves the Royal prerogative of mercy, and s 25A(1) of the Act enables the Offenders’ Review Board to grant parole at any time if the prisoner is dying or there are other ‘exceptional extenuating circumstances’.” 
       
     15 Street CJ in Vachalec said: 
      
       
       “This Court as the Court of Criminal appeal functioning within its well-established jurisdictional boundaries is concerned, both in appeals against conviction and appeals against sentence, primarily to ascertain whether the decision of the first instance judge was in error and, if so, in what way it should be corrected. Normally error requires the evaluation of the material placed before the first instance court. There are, however, well established bases upon which error in the first instance proceedings can be disclosed by fresh evidence or new evidence. In addition the Court’s jurisdiction is exercisable where it is shown that there has been a miscarriage of justice. But, as an Appeal Court, it is not its function, nor is it equipped, to fulfil a continuing supervisory role over the effect of imprisonment upon an individual. Such a matter involves essentially administrative considerations and remedial action involves essentially an exercise of administrative power that this Court does not possess. This Court exercises judicial power; it has not power or authority to give administrative directions regarding the treatment of prisoners. Nor has it power or authority by administrative order to change the character or concomitants of sentences or to bring about total or qualified release of persons in custody. That power and authority resides in the hands of the Executive Government.” 
       
     16 Further, there is the passage in the judgment of Hunt and Badgery-Parker JJ, in R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 242 at 257: 
      
       
        
        “This Court has in some sentence appeals received evidence as to circumstances which, although in existence at the time of sentencing, were not discovered until after the sentence under appeal had been imposed. The example which comes most readily to mind is the discovery that the particular appellant has been infected with the AIDS virus and accordingly has had to be segregated in the Malabar Assessment Unit: cf  
        R v Bailey 
         (1988) 35 A Crim R 458 at 452.  
         
        … 
         
        Where circumstances arise for the first time after sentencing which are alleged to render the sentence imposed either excessive or inadequate, the review of that sentence is the proper province of the executive government and not of this Court:  
        R v Munday 
         [1981] 2 NSWLR 177at 178.” 
         
        
       
     17 The current state of authority would appear to preclude reference to a condition which came into being only after sentence was pronounced. There is, however, precedent for the Court intervening in cases where the relevant medical condition was present at the time of sentencing, although quiescent but became symptomatic subsequently. In R v Vento NSW CCA 6 July 1993, (a case cited without disapproval in R v L), in R v Stebbings (2001) NSWCCA 262, and in R v Eliasen (1991) 53 A Crim R 391, the Court intervened in cases of that kind.  
     18 By reason of an inherent uncertainty in Dr Lawson’s initial report as to whether the applicant’s condition existed at the time of sentencing, but did not become symptomatic until later, the hearing of the application was adjourned, to allow additional evidence to be received. 
     19 That evidence was provided in the form of two further reports from Dr Lawson, the second of which noted by way of an addendum to the earlier reports: 
      
       
        
        “It is reasonable to view the condition of (the applicant’s) epilepsy  
        present at the time of his court attendance and conviction 
        , but quiescent.” 
        
       
     20 The Crown did not seek to have him medically reviewed, nor did it place any additional evidence before us, although it was given the opportunity to do so. 
     21 I am persuaded, in view of this report, that it is properly open for us to examine the evidence which has been tendered and to review the sentence in the light of the principles laid down in the oft cited decision R v Smith (1987) 44 SASR 587 where King CJ at 589 said: 
      
       
       “The state of health of an offender is always relevant to the consideration of the appropriate sentence for the offender. The courts, however, must be cautious as to the influence which they allow this factor to have upon the sentencing process. Ill health cannot be allowed to become a licence to commit crime, nor can offenders generally expect to escape punishment because of the condition of their health. It is the responsibility of the Correctional Services authorities to provide appropriate care and treatment for sick prisoners. Generally speaking ill health will be a factor tending to mitigate punishment only when it appears that imprisonment will be a greater burden on the offender by reason of his state of health, or when there is a serious risk of imprisonment having a gravely adverse effect on the offender’s health.” 
       
     22 As has been subsequently noted in decisions such as McDonald (1988) 38 A Crim R 470 at 475, and L, and Peuna NSW CCA 15 July 1992, the fact that the stress of imprisonment would be likely to exacerbate the condition of an applicant can properly provide a reason for intervention. Additionally, there are cases, of which Vento and R v Dowe NSWCCA 1 September 1995 provide illustrations, where the nature of the applicant’s illness is such as to justify intervention as a matter of common humanity. 
     23 The approach which the Court should take, in such a case, consistent with the flexibility of the sentencing process and the discretion attached to it, was succinctly and helpfully noted in Sopher (1993) 70 A Crim R 570, as follows: 
      
       
       “Health and age are relevant to the length of any sentence but usually, of themselves, would not lead to a gaol sentence not being imposed if it were otherwise warranted. Much depends on the circumstances. For example, a person may have but a short period to live, or need intense treatment, which cannot be provided in gaol. There may be circumstances where, to keep a person in gaol would probably lead to his early death, and this would not otherwise occur. The variety and combination of circumstances are legion. An appropriate balance has to be maintained between the criminality of the conduct in question and any damage to health, or shortening of life. The Department of Corrective Services has the responsibility of providing for health care, but there may be cases where what is required on a permanent basis extends beyond what it can provide and can be expected to provide. In almost all cases, what the Department is able to provide will suffice. If gaol is significantly harder for a person because of difficulties due to health and age, this would be a relevant mater to take into account.” 
       
     24 The realities of prison life, and the practical problems involved in responding urgently to the needs of a prisoner who suffers a fit and in monitoring his or her condition, do need to be taken into account: Burrell (2000) NSWCCA 262. 
     25 Having regard to the matters noted in the report of Dr. Lawson, which suggests that the applicant’s condition is likely to be exacerbated by the stresses of imprisonment, and which also identifies the practical difficulties in properly caring for him, with the consequent risk of injury and increase in the burden of the custodial portion of the sentence, I am of the view that it is proper to intervene. I observe that in some recent cases, with similarities to the present case, such as Azar (2000) NSWCCA 26, Friedmann (2000) NSWCCA 262 and Penman (2001) NSWCCA 308 this court has adjusted either the sentence as a whole or the non-parole period, so as to reflect the changed medical circumstances of the offender. 
     26 In determining what should here be an appropriate sentence, I consider it proper to take into account the progress which the applicant has made towards rehabilitation, both in relation to the courses which he has completed, and in relation to the steps he has made towards overcoming his previous addiction to drugs. The proper course, in my view, is to find that special circumstances additional to those found by his Honour exist, in relation to the condition of epilepsy, which has become symptomatic, and which is better treated outside the gaol system, under the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service. I am not inclined to alter the head sentence, which was entirely appropriate for the criminality which was involved. Moreover, the applicant needs to be reminded of the risks of reoffending, and of the hardship which will attach if he breaks his parole. 
     27 I would accordingly propose that the Court intervene, only to the extent of quashing the non-parole period and of substituting therefore a non-parole period of fourteen months, to expire on 3 January 2002. I would direct the release of the applicant on probation supervision on that date subject to the conditions specified in the Regulations and subject to a condition that he observe such reasonable directions as he may be given as to drug rehabilitation.

     The respondent rode a brakeless bicycle down a sloping driveway onto Cabramatta Avenue. The appellant was driving up Cabramatta Avenue and collided with the respondent. The appellant appealed against the trial Judge’s finding of negligence against the appellant, the assessment of contributory negligence, and quantum of damages. HELD per Meagher JA (Mason P & Young CJ in Eq agreeing):(i) There is no reason to dispute his Honour’s finding of negligence against the appellant. (ii) The act of propelling a brake-less vehicle onto a main road was a major act of contributory negligence. The contributory negligence of the respondent should be increased from 30% to 50%. (iii) The respondent’s non-economic loss should be assessed at 25% of a most extreme case for the purposes of s 79A of the Motor Accidents Act 1988. (iv) Damages for past economic loss should be $1,000.Per Young CJ in Eq (Mason P agreeing):(v) Damages for loss of earning capacity should be $71,033.Per Meagher J (dissenting): 
      
      Damages for loss of earning capacity should be $9,000.

      ABDULLAH ZREIKA 
       
       
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 MASON P: I agree with Young CJ in Eq. 
      
       
     2 MEAGHER JA: The plaintiff, Mr Abdullah Zreika, sued the defendant, Mr Ywau Hei Yip, the present appellant, for damages for negligence arising out of an accident on Cabramatta Avenue, Miller, on 15 February 1997. He succeeded before Moore DCJ in obtaining a verdict of $266,205.72. 
      
       
     3 Although, in the end, the case turned out not to be an easy one, the essential facts may be stated shortly. Cabramatta Avenue, at the relevant place, ran north and south. Mr Zreika entered it on the western side, travelling in an easterly direction. He rode his bicycle (called, in the transcript, a “push-cycle”) down a sloping driveway, across a level footpath, and out onto the Avenue. His bicycle had no brakes. Moreover, as will be seen later, he must have been going at some speed. Unhappily, the appellant was at that time travelling north up Cabramatta Avenue, having just entered it from the west, at a point about 40 metres away. (His Honour said that “The precise distance was not in evidence”, despite the fact that a police officer gave undisputed evidence that he had stepped it out.) 
      
       
     4 The inevitable collision left the plaintiff badly injured. 
      
       
     5 Mr Hoeben SC, learned senior counsel for the appellant, whilst making a formal submission that his Honour’s finding of negligence against his client was unjustified, agreed that the evidence on which his Honour relied in this regard did exist. The appellant admitted that, when entering the Avenue, he saw Mr Zreika, he could have stopped but did not, he knew that the risk of a collision would arise if both parties continued their trajectories uninterrupted, and he took no immediate steps to brake his car. He also knew, obviously, that his motorcar was a more powerful vehicle than Mr Zreika’s bicycle. In these circumstances, I can see no reason to dispute his Honour’s finding of negligence against the appellant. 
      
       
     6 On the other hand, I would find it very difficult to sustain his Honour’s findings on contributory negligence. That Mr Zreika was guilty of some contributory negligence is not in doubt. His Honour found that he did not keep a proper (or any) lookout. Of course, if he had, he would have seen the appellant coming. His Honour did not find that any other head of contributory negligence was made out. I should have thought that the mere act of propelling a brake-less vehicle into a main road was an act (and a major act) of contributory negligence. In the same way pedestrians who rush blindly onto a highway are regularly found to have been contributorily negligent (see for example, Schieb v Abbott (1998) 27 MVR 285). This act of contributory negligence was all the greater in that Mr Zreika must have been riding his bicycle at some speed. This can be inferred from the fact that there was another car, about one car’s length ahead of the appellant’s car, whose driver did not see Mr Zreika and whom Mr Zreika did not see. 
      
       
     7 On this topic his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Some of the particulars of negligence alleged by the defendant against the plaintiff, were that the plaintiff’s cycle had no brakes. The plaintiff readily admitted that lack. This element is not material in assessing negligence in this case. The plaintiff’s negligence lay in not keeping a proper lookout to his right. Having committed that negligence, there was no call for him to attempt to stop, as he rode on, oblivious of the defendant’s presence. The defendant’s account is that the plaintiff simply kept on coming.” 
         
        
        
       I am afraid I quite fail to understand his Honour’s reasoning. To propel a brake-less vehicle into a main road is courting disaster, if for no other reason because it means one cannot stop when the occasion to do so arises, and this must therefore be a central issue on the question of negligence. Indeed, there is strong room for argument that the total culpability for the accident should be divided as to 66% to Mr Zreika and 34% to the appellant; but I am content with a determination that both parties were equally liable for the accident. 
        
       
     8 This brings one to the question of damages. Various heads of damages were decided. As his Honour pointed out, it was exceedingly difficult to ascertain just what damages were suffered. This is so, for many reasons. One is that Mr Zreika’s credibility is not immaculate. He told different stories to different doctors. He concealed facts. He told untruths. He had a lengthy criminal record for various offences, including offences involving dishonesty. Sometimes his testimony was so bizarre that one is left gasping; for example, he gave evidence that he had once run in the City to Surf race, which he then described as a race which began and ended in the City. Nevertheless, his Honour basically believed him (although with reservation) and there is medical evidence consistent with his complaints. What were his complaints about the damage he suffered? He suffered an injury to his right saphenous nerve, but it did not prevent him from running, and it caused a permanent disability to the leg of no more than 1%. His Honour believed him when he complained that he suffered frequent neck pain due to soft tissue injuries; but (a) on his own story, the pain is mild, (b) it was not reported until 6-9 months after the accident, and (c) he has never sought or received any treatment for it. He said (and his Honour believed him) that he suffered from post-concussion headaches, which apparently arose well after the accident. He suffered a closed tibial fracture, which has now united so that he is able to walk on it without a limp. One of his doctors said of this: “he has had an excellent reset from the fractured tibia.” 
      
       
     9 The most severe damage he claimed was psychiatric. This is an area which is particularly difficult to describe. All his life before the accident he had a disturbed personality, and in particular (to quote his Honour) “a grossly abnormal difficulty in controlling his temper”. He had a disturbed childhood, and was physically abused by his father. He had been on many occasions to a psychiatrist before the accident. He had a long list of criminal convictions, many of them for crimes of violence. By the time he was 19 years of age, at the date of the accident, he had spent over three years in prison (as compared, incidentally, to two days in employment). His evidence on this topic, which his Honour accepted – although one would have to be sceptical – was that the accident exaggerated his psychiatric problems until he suffered from an extreme case of Intermittent Explosive Disorder with homicidal tendencies; there was some medical evidence which substantiated his case, although it was mainly conceived as a result of massive falsehood on Mr Zreika’s behalf. 
      
       
     10 On the basis of this evidence, his Honour assessed non-economic loss at 45% of a most extreme case for the purposes of s 79A of the Motor Accidents Act 1988. In my view, in light of the facts I have endeavoured to summarize, the “loss” (which is a measure of his deterioration from his pre-accident position), could not possibly be so high. I cannot see how a figure higher than 25% could be justified. 
      
       
     11 Likewise, his Honour’s figures for past economic loss ($52,384.43) and future economic loss ($179,178.00) seem equally extravagant. The former was calculated on the basis that Mr Zreika but for his injury would have obtained full-time employment and would have retained such employment without losing a day from work to the date of trial. The latter was calculated on the basis that Mr Zreika but for his injury would have engaged in full-time employment as a labourer without losing a day from work to the age of 65, although his work capacity had been reduced by 50% due to the accident. Both these bases are fanciful in the extreme. They are not supported by any evidence at all, and really reflect benevolent guesswork. Nor do they seem to take into account Mr Zreika’s lack of job skills (which were close to zero), the volatility of the labour market (particularly, perhaps, in the Campbelltown area), his pre-injury work history (all two days of it), and his pre-injury personality problems (which arose out of the fact that he seems to be an unstable personality with a criminal record). The totality of the economic loss should be $10,000. 
      
       
     12 The award of interest on damages is governed by s73 of the Motor Accidents Act (1988). s 73(3) provides that no interest is payable on damages for non-economic loss. In assessing whether interest is payable on the remaining heads of damage, it is necessary to consider s73(4) of the Act. 
      
       
     13 The appellant made a formal Offer of Compromise in the sum of $4,000, on 13 January 1999. This was before he had received the reports of Drs Parkington, Cole and Scarf. Under s73(4)(a)(iv) of the Act, interest is not payable unless the amount offered is unreasonable having regard to the information available to the defendant when the offer was made. I agree with his Honour that the offer of $4,000.00 was an unreasonable amount. Accordingly, the appellant is liable to pay interest on damages. s73(6) provides that the rate of interest is to be “three-quarters of the rate prescribed for the purposes of section 95 of the Supreme Court Act 1970…”, say 7%. 
      
       
     14 In the result, I would allow the appeal, and substitute for his Honour’s verdict a verdict in the sum of $21,317.23. This sum is comprised of:

     16 YOUNG CJ in EQ: I have read the reasons for judgment of Meagher JA. 
      
       
     17 Although I believe his Honour’s reasons may be slightly over-generous to the respondent, I am prepared to agree with all that his Honour says with the exception of His Honours assessment of damages. 
      
       
     18 I agree that the trial judge’s assessment was excessive. The basic fault with it was an over-optimistic assessment of what the plaintiff would have earned but for the accident. 
      
       
     19 As Palmer J said in RT & YE Falls Investments Pty Ltd v NSW [2001] NSWSC 1027, “A court must not, under the guise of compensation, award plaintiffs castles of marble where, if no wrong had been suffered, they would probably had but castles in the air.” 
      
       
     20 The only figure adopted by Meagher JA with which I would quarrel is his figure for loss of earning capacity. 
      
       
     21 With respect, the learned Judge was able to accept on the evidence before him that there was a probability that the plaintiff would have settled down and been able to get a job. The Judge’s error was, in my view, that he would have had a job for 42 years. This, as Meagher JA has said, is fanciful. 
      
       
     22 I would allow only a third of this period as being a period for which the plaintiff might work. The multiplier for 14 years is 529.3 which, when reduced by 15% for vicissitudes produces $228,099.32. This figure is too large as it assumes that it is the next 14 years that will be affected. The probabilities are that 14 of the next 42 years will be affected. I thus reduce this figure by one-third to arrive at $142,066. As half the earning capacity is affected, the relevant figure is $71,033. 
      
       
     23 Accordingly, I would reduce the verdict of the plaintiff to $52,334.00 made up as follows: 
      
       
        
       Out of pocket expenses $1,249.45 
        
        Non economic loss 15,500.00 
        
        Past loss of earnings 1,000.00 
        
        Loss of earning capacity 71,033.00 
        
        Interest 70.00 
        
        Cost of future medicals  
       15,815.00 
        
        $104,667.45 
        
        Less 50% contributory negligence  
       52,333.73 
        
        $52.333.72 
        
        
       Rounded off verdict for the plaintiff/respondent for $52,334.00

      REGINA v Neil Andrew SIMPSON 
       
      
      
       
       Facts 
       
       
       The Applicant pleaded guilty to seven counts of obtaining money by making a false statement contrary to s178BB of the  
       Crimes Act 
        1900. His Honour Judge Gibson QC imposed a fixed term of two years for Counts 1-6 and, for Count 7, a term of three years and six months with a non-parole period of two years and seven months. In sentencing the Applicant, his Honour found that there were no special circumstances that would warrant the imposition of a shorter non-parole period under s44(2) of the  
       Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
        1999 (“the 1999 Act”). 
        
        
       The Applicant sought leave to appeal against the sentence imposed. The proceedings originally came before a three judge bench. One of the issues that arose before the Court was whether the discussion of special circumstances outlined by Sperling J in  
       R v Hameed 
        [2001] NSWCCA 287 was correct. The Court reconstituted as a bench of five to determine this and the remaining submissions. 
        
        
       Held 
        
       A Special circumstances 
        
       per Spigelman CJ; Mason P, Grove J, Sully J and Newman AJ agreeing 
        
       1 There is no basis to the proposition that a finding of special circumstances must be based exclusively, or primarily, on the fact that it is desirable for an offender to be subjected to an extended period of supervision on parole.  
       Griffiths v The Queen 
        (1989) 167 CLR 372,  
       R v Moffitt 
        (1990) 20 NSWLR 114,  
       R v Phelan 
        (1993) 66 ACrimR 447,  
       R v Morrissey 
        (NSWCCA, 15 July 1994, unreported),  
       R v GDR 
        (1994) 35 NSWLR 376,  
       R v Edigarov 
        [2001] NSWCCA 436 discussed. 
        
        
       2 The primary perspective in determining the non-parole period is the length of the minimum period of actual incarceration.  
       Power v The Queen 
        (1973) 131 CLR 623 referred to. 
        
        
       3 The scope of the considerations relevant to the determination of special circumstances encompasses the full range of issues that are relevant to the determination of the minimum period of actual incarceration.  
        
        
       4 Section 44(2) operates as a “fetter” or “constraint” on the exercise of the sentencing discretion.  
       R v GDR 
        (supra) referred to. The decision required is, firstly, one of fact (to identify the circumstances) and, secondly, one of judgment (to determine whether those circumstances justify a lower proportion between the head sentence and the non-parole period). 
        
        
       per Sully J 
        
       5 Before any question of special circumstances arises, a correct balance between the proper head sentence and the proper non-parole period must be determined. It is only in the case where the resulting proportion is less than three-quarters that it is necessary to either redetermine the head sentence and non-parole period, or to identify the special circumstances justifying the reduction of the non-parole period. 
        
        
       B Giving of reasons under s44(2) 
        
       per Spigelman CJ; Mason P, Grove J, Sully J and  
       Newman AJ agreeing 
        
       6 There is no obligation to give reasons for not varying the statutory relationship in s44(2) of the 1999 Act.  
       R v Bo Too  
       (NSWCCA, 16 July 1992, unreported) discussed;  
       R v Astill (No 2)  
       (1992) 64 ACrimR 289 approved. 
        
        
       7 His Honour expressly referred to special circumstances. There was no error or ambiguity in his Honour’s reasons. 
        
        
       C Sentence appeals 
        
       per Spigelman CJ; Mason P, Grove J and Newman AJ agreeing 
        
       8 On its proper construction, s6(3) of the  
       Criminal Appeal Act 
        1912 requires an appeal court to form the opinion that another sentence is “warranted in law “ and “should have been passed” before it is possible to quash the sentence imposed and pass another in substitution. Section 6(3) further requires the identification of error.  
       Dinsdale v The Queen 
        (2000) 202 CLR 321 referred to. 
        
        
       per Sully J 
        
       9 Some error must be demonstrated before an appeal court becomes entitled to consider interfering with the sentence passed at first instance under s6(3) of the  
       Criminal Appeal Act 
       .  
       R v Vachalec  
       [1981] 1NSWLR 351,  
       R v Visconti  
       [1982] 2 NSWLR 104 referred to. 
        
        
       per Spigelman CJ; Mason P, Grove J, Sully J and Newman AJ agreeing 
        
       10 In this case the sentences imposed by his Honour were appropriate. 
        
        
       Decision 
        
       Leave to appeal against sentence granted. Appeal dismissed

      REGINA v Neil Andrew SIMPSON 
       
       
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 SPIGELMAN CJ: The Applicant pleaded guilty to seven counts of obtaining money by making a false statement contrary to s178BB of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum sentence for such an offence is five years imprisonment. On 10 October 2000 in the Penrith District Court before his Honour Judge Gibson QC the Applicant adhered to his pleas and asked his Honour to take into account a further twenty-five offences against s178BB on a Form 1. All of the counts in the indictment and all of the offences on the Form 1 were in basically similar terms. Each involved loan applications to banks containing material particulars which were false to the knowledge of the Applicant. His Honour imposed a fixed term of two years for Counts 1-6 and, for Count 7, a term of three years and six months with a non-parole period of two years and seven months. 
      
       
     2 The Applicant committed the offences by obtaining loans from three different banks, the Colonial State Bank, Westpac Bank and St George Bank. He did so by using a number of false names under which he passed himself off by using false and forged documents. There was some dispute between the Crown and the Applicant before the sentencing judge as to the total amount that he had obtained in this manner. His Honour did not find it necessary to determine a precise amount. He held that it was between $140,000 and $220,000 and correctly concluded that this was a substantial amount. It gave a particular level of gravity to the objective seriousness of the offences. 
      
       
     3 The offences indicated a substantial degree of planning over a long period of time. The Applicant manufactured documentation to enable him to pass himself off to bank staff under a range of false identities. 
      
       
     4 After his arrest and plea of guilty there was a long period of delay before sentencing. This arose by reason of the fact that the Applicant made allegations against a number of serving and former police officers as to their involvement in these and similar offences. The investigation into these allegations took some time.  
      
       
        
       Remarks on Sentence 
       
     5 The sentencing judge referred in his remarks on sentence to the subjective circumstances of the Applicant. Those circumstances were unremarkable. As is usual, the information before the Court was based on the Applicant’s own assertions as provided, in this case, to an officer of the Probation and Parole Service for purposes of a report and also to a clinical psychologist. 
      
       
     6 The Applicant referred to a motor vehicle accident in 1995 in which he was injured. Thereafter, he said, he began to consume large amounts of alcohol and engage in excessive gambling. It was during this period that he came into contact with some police officers who informed him of a scheme to defraud banks. He asserted that he became involved with these police officers in such conduct and, after a period of time, began to act in this way on his own. His Honour referred to all of these matters, and to the contents of the two reports. The general thrust of those reports was to affirm the Applicant’s commitment to overcome his drinking and gambling problem. This was confirmed by a further report presented to this Court from the Alcohol and Other Drugs Unit of the Department of Corrective Services. 
      
       
     7 On the basis of the subjective material before the court his Honour concluded that the Applicant had “good prospects of rehabilitation”.  
      
       
     8 In his remarks on sentencing his Honour made reference to the absence of any reparation. His Honour noted that the Applicant had saved a sum of $60,000 but noted that there was no attempt or offer to repay the banks which he defrauded. 
      
       
     9 His Honour also referred to the issue of assistance to the police and concluded: 
      
       
        
         
         “The onus of proving matters of mitigation rests upon the prisoner. The prisoner has on a prior occasion in 1989 been involved in a charge of public mischief made in respect of allegations against officers of Parks and Wildlife. I have read the transcript of the interview he had with the police … I do not feel that it is my function to make a finding concerning the allegations made against other people in this matter. What I have to decide is whether he is entitled to mitigation for information given to the police. There is nothing from them to indicate that it was of assistance. Of course, it does not matter that nothing comes of the information. However, it seems to me that to make a finding that it was in mitigation it must be shown that the information given must be obtained at a time in the investigation to enable it to be properly investigated. That time may vary and information that comes years later may be of vital importance. It may be of no value within hours. 
         
        
        
         
         Looking at the information which he says he had at the time of his arrest and which he deliberately delayed for two years and what happened at the subsequent investigation, it was at the time it was handed to the police of little value and by way of mitigation small, and that is the amount of mitigation I will give it in the circumstances of this case.” 
         
        
       
     10 His Honour indicated that he would take into account the utilitarian value of the plea but did not quantify the amount. 
      
       
     11 Of particular significance in the present case is his Honour’s reasoning with respect to the subject of “special circumstances” and whether a shorter non-parole period should be fixed than by the application of the statutory relationship. Issues have arisen as to what matters his Honour took into account and whether his reasons were adequate. 
      
       
     12 The structure of his Honour’s remarks on sentence were to outline the objective circumstances of the offence, then to outline the subjective material put before the Court, then to consider what, if any, mitigation for assistance should be given. Immediately after the passage on the latter subject that I have extracted above, his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I see no reason to find special circumstances in this case.” 
         
        
       
     13 His Honour then went on to say, immediately after that sentence: 
      
       
        
         
         “This was not an isolated event but of course conduct over an extended period of time. It requires, in my view, a custodial sentence, not just to deter him but also to deter any like-minded person.” 
         
        
       
       
       His Honour continued: 
        
        
         
         “Taking all the matters above-mentioned in mitigation into consideration, including the utilitarian value of the plea, and taking into consideration the twenty-five matters on the Form 1 …” 
         
        
        
       His Honour then imposed the sentence for Count 7 in respect of which he took into consideration the matters on the Form 1. His Honour said that this sentence “will encompass the totality of his criminality in relation to all charges”. His Honour went on to impose fixed terms for the other six counts “because a non-parole period would be ineffective”. 
        
        
       Submissions on Appeal 
       
     14 In submissions to this Court, Mr Game SC, Counsel for the Applicant suggested that this approach was not consistent with the decision of the High Court in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. No complaint, however, was made in the appeal in this regard.  
      
       
     15 There was no significant differentiation between the nature of the offending with respect to any of the seven counts. However, it was Count 7 with respect to which the Form 1 offences were to be taken into account. The sentence for Count 7 was necessarily higher than the sentence for the other counts. I see no reason why the result is not compatible with Pearce but this does not need to be determined. 
      
       
     16 Two matters were highlighted in the submissions as indicating error. It was submitted that his Honour gave little weight to the plea and, specifically, that he failed to quantify the utilitarian value to which his Honour referred (see R v Thompson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 683 at [160]). Counsel noted that at the time the plea was entered, some ten other offences charged were no-billed and, accordingly, it was suggested that something close to the maximum discount identified in Thompson & Houlton was appropriate. 
      
       
     17 The Applicant also submitted that the trial judge should have made a finding of special circumstances and that the brief treatment of this issue in the remarks on sentence constitutes a significant inadequacy in his reasons. Reliance was placed on the evidence concerning the subjective circumstances of the Applicant including the pre-sentence report, the evidence of the psychologist and the evidence of the Applicant’s father. It was submitted that the finding of special circumstances ought to have been made and there was legal error in the failure to do so. Alternatively, his honour failed to give proper reasons in this regard and this would justify this Court intervening. 
      
       
        
       Special Circumstances 
       
     18 This application for leave to appeal was originally listed before a three judge bench. When the matter was first heard an issue of principle arose on which, it was submitted, there were differing views expressed in the judgments of this Court relating to what facts and matters were capable of constituting “special circumstances” for the purposes of s44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the 1999 Act”). Reference was made to the reasons of Sperling J, when sitting in a two judge bench of the Court in R v Hameed [2001] NSWCCA 287. His Honour contrasted what his Honour identified as “the strict approach” to s44 from what his Honour called a “liberal view” to s44. The Court before which this issue arose originally decided that the matter should be referred to a bench of five (see R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 297).  
      
       
     19 Section 44 of the 1999 Act states: 
      
       
        
         
         “44(1) When sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence, a court is required: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) firstly, to set the term of the sentence, and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) secondly, to set a non-parole period for the sentence (that is, the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence). 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (2) The non-parole period must not be less than three-quarters of the term of the sentence, unless the court decides there are special circumstances for it being less, in which case the court must make a record of its reasons for that decision. 
         
        
        
         
         (3) Subsection (2) does not limit any other requirement that a court has, apart from that subsection, to record the reasons for its decision. 
         
        
        
         
         (4) The failure of a court to comply with the requirements of subsection (2) with respect to a sentence does not invalidate the sentence.” 
         
        
       
     20 Section 44 replaced s5 of the Sentencing Act 1989 (“the 1989 Act”) which provided: 
      
       
        
         
         “5(1) When sentencing a person to imprisonment for an offence, a court is required: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) firstly, to set a minimum term of imprisonment that the person must serve for the offence, and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) secondly, to set an additional term during which the person may be released on parole. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (2) The additional term must not exceed one-third of the minimum term, unless the court decides there are special circumstances. 
         
        
        
         
         (3) If a court sets an additional term that exceeds one-third of the minimum term, the court is required to state the reason for that decision. 
         
        
        
         
         (4) The minimum and additional terms set for an offence together comprise, for the purposes of any law, the term of the sentence of the court for the offence.” 
         
        
       
     21 As was noted in R v Carrion (2000) 49 NSWLR 149 at [15] and R v Qutami [2000] NSWCCA 353 at [15] the change in approach reflected in the 1999 legislative scheme did have effects upon the previous decisions of the Court.  
      
       
     22 Prior to the Sentencing Act 1989 this matter was the subject to statutory provision in the Probation and Parole Act 1983 (“the 1983 Act”). It provided: 
      
       
        
         
         “20A(1) If 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) a non-parole period is to be specified with respect to one or more offences (including, where relevant, an offence for which a term of imprisonment is already being served); and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) the offence or at least one of the offences is a serious offence, 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         this section applies to the non-parole period. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) The non-parole period shall be at least three-quarters of- 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) the length of the sentence for the only serious offence involved; or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) the total length of the sentences for all the serious offences involved (any two or more such sentences that are wholly or partly concurrent being treated as one sentence to the extent of their concurrence). 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           … 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (21) … 
         
        
        
         
         (3) Notwithstanding section 20A, a court or the Board, when specifying a non-parole period with respect to a serious offence, may specify a shorter period than that required by section 20A, but only if it determines that the circumstances justify that course. 
         
        
        
         
         (4) If a court or the Board specify such a shorter non-parole period, it shall state the reasons for doing so.” 
         
        
       
     23 As can be seen, the 1983 provision referred only to “circumstances” rather than “special circumstances”. However, this Court had held that circumstances which justify reduction of the non-parole period below three quarters should be “exceptional” or “special or exceptional”. (See e.g. the references in Griffiths v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 372 at 276-377.)  
      
       
     24 The issue that appears to have arisen is whether or not a finding of special circumstances must be based exclusively, or primarily, on a finding that in the circumstances of the case it was desirable that an offender be subject to an extended period of supervision on parole. A decision that special circumstances exist does have the consequence of increasing the period that would otherwise be spent on parole. It also, however, has the consequence of reducing the period that must be spent in detention.  
      
       
     25 What approach is to be adopted appears to me to be simply a matter of perspective, equivalent to asking whether a bottle is half full or half empty. Nevertheless, the difference appears to be regarded as capable of having practical consequences. 
      
       
     26 The Crown submissions to this Court conceded that “special circumstances” could not be confined to cases in which a longer period of supervision was required. It did, however, submit that the vast majority of cases would be of that character. The Applicant’s submission was that the 1999 Act did not require a primary, let alone an exclusive, focus on the purposes of parole. The Crown submitted that the authorities did not suggest that Sperling J’s characterisation of a “strict” versus “liberal” approach was appropriate. 
      
       
     27 In Hameed, Sperling J said at [53]: 
      
       
        
         
         “Some of the authorities state that the only relevant consideration is the need for a longer period under care and supervision on parole than would otherwise be the case for the purpose of rehabilitation. I will call this ‘the strict approach’.” 
         
        
       
     28 His Honour’s reference to “the only relevant consideration” (emphasis added) is his Honour’s interpretation of the effect of the reasoning in the cases to which he refers. No judgment uses that terminology. 
      
       
     29 The origins of what is said to be a narrow or “strict” approach to the scope of considerations which are relevant for the purposes of deciding that there should be a lower than statutory relationship between the non-parole period and the head sentence (previously between the minimum and additional terms), is said to be the judgment of Samuels JA in R v Moffitt (1990) 20 NSWLR 114. (See e.g. Hameed (supra) at [54]). In Moffitt Samuels JA said at 115G-116B: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is unnecessary to attempt a comprehensive definition of ‘special circumstances’; but the general character and scope of the phrase is determined by the statutory content of both language and purpose in which it appears. It must be assumed that s5 has the rehabilitative purpose (affirmed by Pt 3 of the Act) generally perceived to be advanced by a system of release on parole; and regards it as adequately achieved in the ordinary course by setting the period during which a sentence may be served on parole at no more than one-third of the preceding period of incarceration to be served for the same offence. This relationship is the statutory norm which may be varied if ‘the court decides there are special circumstances’. ‘Special circumstances’ must therefore include those circumstances, particular to the prisoner, which justify increasing the statutory proportion which the additional term bears to the minimum term. The purpose of parole being rehabilitative, any extension of that part of a sentence to be served on parole (the additional term)  
         by increasing the time during which the support and supervision of the parole system is available 
         , must be designed to benefit the prisoner. It follows that ‘special circumstances’ must mean those circumstances which justify enlarging in the prisoner’s favour the existing rehabilitative purpose of section 5.  
         (Emphasis added) 
         ” 
         
        
       
     30 It would have come as a great surprise to Samuels JA to learn that his approach to the construction of s5 was restrictive or “strict”. His Honour went on immediately to state: 
      
       
        
         
         “I can see no grounds for reading the phrase ‘special circumstances’ in any more restrictive way.” 
          (At 116C) 
         
        
       
     31 In my opinion his Honour’s reference to “increasing the time during which the support and supervision of the parole system is available” was not intended to identify the sole perspective from which “special circumstances” must be assessed. 
      
       
     32 His Honour went on to distinguish expressly the purpose of s5 of the 1989 Act from what he described as “the solely punitive purpose” of s20A of the 1983 Act, which was discussed by the High Court in Griffith v The Queen (supra). He went on to note that the use of the word “exceptional” in the authorities referred to in that case for purposes of identifying the kinds of “circumstances” which would satisfy the form of s20A was not appropriate for the new s5 by reason of its rehabilitative purpose. His Honour said that “circumstances of less moment may suffice” in the case of s5 of the 1989 Act, than those which appear to have been required under s20A of the 1983 Act. 
      
       
     33 The scope of considerations which his Honour regarded as relevant to the determination, in a particular case, that a non-parole period should be lower than the statutory proportion is made clear in the next passage of his Honour’s reasoning at 116E-G: 
      
       
        
         
         “In determining whether there are special circumstances justifying a proportionate increase in the additional term the court must consider all the relevant circumstances; that is to say … all the factors which the prisoner’s overall situation exhibits and which in combination make the case special and bear upon the suitability of a longer than normal additional term. … 
         
        
        
         
         There seems to me to be no basis for reading the provisions so as to exclude from the category of ‘special circumstances’ factors which might already have been considered in determining the minimum term. … the Act now entails that all facts relevant to the sentence to be imposed must be considered for the purpose of fixing a minimum term.” 
         
        
       
     34 The second reference given by Sperling J in Hameed at [54] as constituting the “strict approach” in Moffitt is the judgment of Badgery-Parker J at 136 where his Honour referred at 136C and 136D to “a longer period of supervision” is “needed” or “warranted”. 
      
       
     35 Again, however, the context in which these references appear suggests strongly that his Honour’s intention was to adopt an expansive rather than a “strict” approach. His Honour said at 135G-136D: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is a matter of mathematical fact that the result of the formula used in s20A of the Probation and Parole Act to express the relationship between non-parole period and head sentence and the formula in s5(2) of the Sentencing Act, expressing the relationship between minimum term and additional term, are the same. This tends to direct one’s attention, in construing s5(2), to the judgments in R v Griffiths: (Court of Criminal Appeal, 23 March 1989 and 21 September 1989, unreported); (High Court) Griffiths v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 372. The judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal emphasised that s20A was intended to be punitive in its effect, and to lay down a prima facie rule as to the proportion between non-parole period and head sentence, from which a sentencing judge was at liberty to depart only in the case of special or exceptional circumstances. The High Court endorsed that view. It seems to me that the different structure of s5(2) of the Sentencing Act leads to a different conclusion; so too does the legislative history. Section 20A was avowedly introduced to ‘toughen up’ sentences in the case of serious crimes only. It was engrafted onto an existing system for that purpose. The object of the Sentencing Act was not to increase sentences – s3 spells out the objective expressly. The requirement for a fixed proportion between minimum term and additional term is not limited to serious offences only, but is of general application. That being so, and noting that a different form of words has been chosen to express the circumstances in which a sentencing judge may depart from the prima facie rule, I am of opinion that while a judge should adhere to the one-third rule unless clear reasons appear to the contrary, the finding of clear reason in a particular case would justify departure from it. It will not be every case where a judge believes that a longer period of supervision is needed that will amount to special circumstances. A judge may not give rein to his own personal philosophy that short periods of incarceration followed by long periods on parole should be the norm. If, however, it can be seen in an individual case that for reasons which can be identified in the facts of the individual case, a longer period of parole supervision is warranted than would be provided by adherence to the one-third rule, the judge is entitled to regard that as a special circumstance justifying a departure.” 
         
        
       
     36 It is by no means clear that his Honour intended the reference to “a longer period of parole supervision” to be a statement of the only circumstances in which a finding of “special circumstances” was able to be made. Indeed, his Honour went on immediately to say at 136D-E: 
      
       
        
         
         “Furthermore, it is clear that the legislature contemplated an additional term equal to one-third of the period of incarceration. In my view, where the period of incarceration is, as it must be in the present case, accumulated to some extent on an earlier sentence, that may of itself constitute a special circumstance justifying departure from the prima facie rule.” 
         
        
       
       
       This is not necessarily related to the desirability of a “longer period of parole supervision”. However, accumulation may require adjustment of a single sentence to re-establish the statutory proportion for the actual total sentence. 
        
       
     37 The reasoning in Moffitt, which I have quoted above, indicates that the Court thought that a less restrictive approach was warranted under the 1989 Act than had been adopted under the 1983 Act. Accordingly, it would be surprising if their Honours identified a narrower range of relevant considerations than the High Court adopted in Griffiths with respect to the 1983 Act. 
      
       
     38 In Griffiths, Brennan and Dawson JJ said at 379: 
      
       
        
         
         “[The Court of Criminal Appeal] correctly observed that particular circumstances may subject an offender to unusual hardship and may be exceptional enough to bring s21(3) into play: for example, the offender’s health, the nature of the particular offence or the fact that the offender has informed on other offenders. These are factors which are peculiar to individual offenders and are out of the ordinary. Whilst particular factors peculiar to an individual offender may make a case special or exceptional, in our view they do not exhaust the circumstances which can justify the specification of a shorter parole period under s21(3). The Court of Criminal Appeal appears to have taken a contrary view and, in doing so, to have fallen into error in this case. 
         
        
        
         
         Although there is no particular factor to which an offender can point which of itself would justify a shorter non-parole period, his overall situation might exhibit a number of factors which in combination make the case exceptional and bear upon the suitability of a shorter than normal non-parole period. The power conferred by s21(3) may properly be exercised in such a case. In the present case, all the offences were committed within little more than a month; the applicant was only twenty-one years of age without any history of serious criminal activity; he was affected by drugs when he committed the offences, although his addiction to drugs was recent and, apparently, short lived; his confession of guilt and co-operation with the police suggest that the offences were episodic rather than the manifestation of any ingrained criminal tendencies; he had a better than average prospect of rehabilitation. Although no one of these factors was exceptional, in combination they may reasonably be regarded as amounting to exceptional circumstances. It appears to us that the Court of Criminal Appeal failed to evaluate the combination and so failed properly to consider matters which were relevant to the existence of a discretion under s21(3).” 
         
        
       
     39 The list of relevant considerations in the joint judgment of Brennan and Dawson JJ, being the second paragraph of the above extract, was specifically referred to in the other judgments of the Court in terms that, on remission to the Court of Criminal Appeal, this Court would take into account all the circumstances including the matters referred to in that paragraph of the joint judgment of Brennan and Dawson JJ. (See Deane J at 388 and Gaudron and McHugh JJ at 397.) 
      
       
     40 Furthermore, at 392 Gaudron and McHugh JJ said that: 
      
       
        
         
         “… it is the totality of the circumstances which must ‘justify’ the exercise of the power conferred by s21(3) to reduce the non-parole period specified by s20A.” 
         
        
       
     41 Similarly, at 396 their Honours referred to the Court being entitled to take into account “all relevant subjective and objective factors” when exercising the power conferred by s21(3) to specify a shorter period than that required by s20A. 
      
       
     42 The reasoning of the High Court in Griffiths, albeit with reference to the 1983 Act, is inconsistent with the adoption of the longer than usual period of supervision perspective as the sole perspective for the determination of “special circumstances”. I do not believe that the judgments in Moffitt intended to adopt such a proposition. 
      
       
     43 The next judgment identified by Sperling J in Hameed adopting the “strict” approach is that of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Phelan (1993) 66 ACrimR 447. His Honour said at 449: 
      
       
        
         
         “What does constitute a matter as a special circumstance within the meaning of s5(2) is its production of the need or the desirability for the offender to be subjected to an extended period of conditional release subject to supervision on parole.” 
         
        
       
     44 It is, however, necessary to set out the whole of the passage in which this sentence appears. When this is done it is by no means clear that his Honour was intending to restrict the scope of matters capable of constituting “special circumstances” only to matters that could be described in that manner. The whole of the passage is at 449-450: 
      
       
        
         
         “To accept that these matters – taken either singly or in their totality – constitute special circumstances within the meaning of s5(2) would effectively remove the adjective ‘special’ from the subsection. ‘Special’ does not necessarily mean ‘unusual’, but it does mean something more than merely a subjective feature of the case. What does constitute a matter as a special circumstance within the meaning of s5(2) is its production of the need or the desirability for the offender to be subjected to an extended period of conditional release subject to supervision on parole. That need or desirability may arise from the prospect of particular difficulties in adjustment after long periods in custody, or from the greater prospect of rehabilitation if supervised whilst on parole than from a longer period of incarceration. Such will often be the case with young offenders who are facing their first custodial sentence. Those statements are taken from the judgments of this Court in Moffitt (1990) 20 NSWLR 114 at 121, 132, 136; 49 ACrimR 20 at 26-27, 38, 41-42. The necessary consequence of a decision that a longer than usual additional term is necessary or desirable is that the minimum term must be shorter than it otherwise would have been: Moffitt (at 118, 121, 134-135; 24, 27, 40-41). But the starting point is the need or the desirability of a longer than usual additional term,  
         not 
          the need or the desirability of a shorter than usual minimum term. 
         
        
        
         
         These statements do not, of course, limit what may constitute special circumstances within the meaning of s5(2 
         ). I referred to some other matters which may constitute special circumstances in Close (1992) 65 ACrimR 55.  
         They are many in number and nature, and I would not want to be thought to have intended to circumscribe the width of the expression which s5(2) has used 
         .”  
         (Emphasis added in last paragraph) 
         
        
       
     45 Hunt CJ at CL stated expressly that he did not intend “to circumscribe the width of the expression” “special circumstances”. Whilst his Honour did expressly adopt the perspective of ‘a longer than usual period of supervision on parole’ it appears to me that his Honour was identifying the most common, rather than an exclusive, perspective. 
      
       
     46 The third case to which Sperling referred in Hameed as adopting the strict approach was R v Morrissey (NSWCCA, 15 July 1994, unreported). However, in that case the Court expressly said that the full range of subjective considerations was capable of constituting special circumstances. Their Honours said that an additional term of only one third will be found to be inappropriate “usually” only where “effective rehabilitation … requires … a longer period of supervision”. The Court was not propounding this perspective as an exclusive one. 
      
       
     47 Similarly, in R v Edigarov [2001] NSWCCA 436, Wood CJ at CL at [52] referred to the reduction of the statutory proposition as “in most cases being referrable to the need for an extended period of post release supervision, or for access to some form of treatment which is not readily available within the prison system” (emphasis added). Again, his Honour was not propounding an exclusive criterion. 
      
       
     48 The issue came before this Court constituted by five judges in R v GDR (1994) 35 NSWLR 376. The Court comprised Gleeson CJ, Mahoney JA, McInerney, Badgery-Parker and Dunford JJ. It is to the joint judgment in GDR that this Court must give primary attention on this appeal. In my opinion, that judgment indicates that whilst the perspective involved in approaching the determination of special circumstances from the point of view of a longer than usual non-parole period is a permissible one, it does not constitute an exclusive perspective. 
      
       
     49 In GDR the Court deprecated the use of the expression “statutory norm”, with respect to the relationship for which s5 provided, as diverting attention from the task of construing and applying the 1989 Act in accordance with its terms (see 379B). The use of the terminology “statutory norm” had diverted attention from the fact that the statutory prescription “… is about setting additional terms in excess of a certain amount; it is not about setting additional terms less than a certain amount” (at 379F and see 380F).  
      
       
     50 The Court referred to the statutory provision as “a statutory fetter upon the sentencing discretion” (at 379E). The Court concluded at 381G-382B: 
      
       
        
         
         “2 Section 5(2) is a statutory provision which constrains a sentencing judge’s exercise of discretion. The language of the provision is clear. The additional term must not exceed one-third of the minimum term unless the court considers that there are special circumstances. The statute does not provide that the additional term must not be less than one-third of the minimum term. 
         
        
        
         
         3 The discretion of a sentencing judge who would otherwise be minded to set an additional term exceeding one-third of the minimum term is constrained by s5(2). There is nothing in s5 which constrains the discretion of a sentencing judge in relation to setting an additional term less than one-third of the minimum term.” 
         
        
       
     51 Of particular significance is the breadth of the facts and matters capable of constituting special circumstances which the Court treated as being open. The Court said at 378C-D: 
      
       
        
         
         “The features of the present case which were said to constitute special circumstances were as follows. First, the applicant will serve his sentence in protective custody. Secondly, this is his first term of imprisonment. Thirdly the applicant surrendered himself to the police, fully admitted his guilt, and in due course pleaded guilty. 
         
        
        
         
         It would have been open to the sentencing judge, in the exercise of his discretion, to regard those circumstances, in combination, as special circumstances within the meaning of s5(2) 
         . However, his Honour was not bound to do so, or to respond to the circumstances by setting an additional term which was in excess of one-third of the minimum term.”  
         (Emphasis added) 
         
        
       
     52 Nothing in this passage suggests that the joint judgment approached the question of special circumstances exclusively from the perspective of the desirability of a longer than usual period on parole. That is a permissible perspective (see e.g. GDR at 382C). However, the express acceptance of all of these matters, including for example the harsher than normal circumstances of incarceration by reason of protective custody, suggests that it is not the only perspective permissible. 
      
       
     53 It is unnecessary to review the numerous authorities in which this Court has made reference to “special circumstances”. The primary authorities said to reflect a “strict approach” do not, in my opinion, reflect a difference as to the matters which may be taken into consideration in determining whether the “circumstances” are sufficiently “special” to warrant a variation in the statutory proportion. Rather, the differences reflect the wide variation in the range of legitimate opinion in the formulation of a discretionary judgment. 
      
       
     54 An analogous issue arose in judgments of this Court to the effect that a non-parole period should generally be fixed as a short period to permit the parole authorities to determine when the offender should be released on parole. (See e.g. R v Portolesi [1973] 1 NSWLR 105 esp at 107 and R v Sloane [1973] 1 NSWLR 202 at 206). The reasoning was based on the proposition that the purpose of a non-parole period was not to fix the minimum sentence to be served, so as to ensure that an offender did in fact suffer at least that degree of actual punishment. The Court gave primary weight to the rehabilitative purposes of parole. The approach to “special circumstances” which focuses on the longer than usual period under supervision, adopts a similar approach.  
      
       
     55 The High Court overruled this earlier line of authority in Power v The Queen (1973) 131 CLR 623. The joint judgment of four justices of the Court said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The judge, in fixing a non-parole period, must, we believe, have regard not to the time within which the paroling authority must consider the prisoner’s case but to the time for which the prisoner must remain in confinement.”  
         (At 627) 
           
         
        
       
       
       And: 
        
        
         
         “It is our opinion that the Act as a whole does not convert a sentence of imprisonment from a punishment into an opportunity for rehabilitation.”  
         ( 
         Ibid 
         ) 
         
        
        
       And: 
        
        
         
         “In a true sense the non-parole period is a minimum period of imprisonment to be served because the sentencing judge considers that the crime committed calls for such detention.”  
         (At 628) 
         
        
        
       And: 
        
        
         
         “… the legislative intention … [is] to provide for mitigation of the punishment of the prisoner in favour of his rehabilitation through conditional freedom, when appropriate, once the prisoner has served the minimum time that a judge determines justice requires that he must serve having regard to all the circumstances of his offence.”  
         (At 629) 
         
        
       
     56 This approach has been affirmed in a number of subsequent joint judgments, including in a joint judgment of seven members of the High Court. (See e.g. Deakin v The Queen (1984) 58 ALJR 367; The Queen v Watt (1988) 165 CLR 474 at 481; Bugmy v The Queen (1990) 169 CLR 525 at 531; Leeth v The Queen (1992) 67 ALJR 167 at 169B.) This conclusion is reinforced, for present purposes, by the express provision in s44(1)(b) of the 1999 Act which identifies a non-parole period as “the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence”. 
      
       
     57 The reasoning in Power indicates that it is not appropriate to determine the non-parole period primarily from the perspective of the length of the period of supervision on parole. Indeed, the primary perspective should be the length of the minimum period of actual incarceration. By enacting a provision that only works one way – requiring specific justification for a lower proportion but not for a higher proportion – Parliament has, in my opinion, reinforced this as the primary perspective. This has the effect that the scope of the considerations relevant to the determination of “special circumstances” must encompass the full range of issues which are relevant to the determination of the minimum period of actual incarceration without hope of release on parole. 
      
       
     58 The length of the non-parole period remains, however, of potential significance. Indeed, the requirements of rehabilitation would be best computed in terms of a period of linear time, not in terms of a fixed percentage of a head sentence. The desirability of a longer than computed period of supervision will be an appropriate approach in many cases. It is not, however, the only perspective. 
      
       
     59 The words “special circumstances” appear in numerous statutory provisions. They are words of indeterminate reference and will always take their colour from their surroundings. The sentencing context in which they appear in the present legislation must be understood against the background of a long-standing line of decisions in the High Court, commencing with Power, which emphasises that the non-parole period is to be determined by what the sentencing judge concludes that all of the circumstances of the case, including the need for rehabilitation, indicate ought be the minimum period of actual incarceration. The proposition that the fixing of a non-parole period is a matter that is to be determined solely, or primarily, by reason of considerations of rehabilitation has long since been rejected. 
      
       
     60 Statutory words of such generality usually lead courts to refuse to identify in advance a list of matters capable of satisfying the statutory formulation. While certain considerations might not often be sufficiently “special”, so that an exceptional justification is required for them to attain the requisite statutory quality, nevertheless there may always be circumstances in which such a factor is of sufficient strength, either alone or in combination with other factors, to justify a conclusion that “special circumstances” are made out on the facts of a particular case. It will be comparatively rare for an issue to arise in terms of a proposition that a particular circumstance is incapable, as a matter of law, of ever constituting a “special circumstance”.  
      
       
     61 The statutory proportion constitutes a ‘fetter’ or ‘constraint’ (to use the words of the Court in GDR, quoted above) on the exercise of what would otherwise be an unfettered and unconstrained discretion. It does not, however, alter the discretionary nature of the judgment for which the statute provides in s44(1)(b) of the 1999 Act, requiring the Court to fix a non-parole period, subject to s45 of the Act. 
      
       
     62 The issues of law that may arise are the same as those which arise on appeal from other discretionary decisions, including whether or not, on the facts of a particular case, a specific fact, matter or circumstance is, either alone or in combination with other facts, matters and circumstances, capable of constituting “special circumstances” of the requisite character, i.e. that it is capable of justifying a variation in the statutory proportion which the legislature has enacted. 
      
       
     63 More significantly, there is the ultimate constraint that the non-parole period must itself appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence. 
      
       
     64 Counsel for the Applicant, submitted that considerations of general deterrence are of greater significance for setting a head sentence than for determining a non-parole period. He referred to Bugmy v The Queen (supra) at 531-532. I can see nothing in the High Court’s reasons in Bugmy which supports that submission. Considerations of general deterrence are at least equally significant to both decisions which are, in any event, interrelated. Indeed the purport of the High Court’s decision in Power was to reject the proposition that considerations of punishment and deterrence were of primary relevance to the determination of the head sentence and of lesser relevance to the specification of the non-parole period. 
      
       
     65 In addition to the need to identify and articulate “special circumstances”, in order to overcome the statutory constraint on the exercise of the discretion to fix a non-parole period, the need to ensure that the time an offender must spend in prison reflects all of the circumstances of the offence and the offender – including the objective gravity of the offence and the need for general deterrence – operates to confine the proper range for the exercise of the discretion. (See R v Maclay (1990) 19 NSWLR 112 at 122G-123A;  R v Morrissey (supra); R v McDonald (NSWCCA, 12 October 1998, unreported); R v Henry & Barber [1999] NSWCCA 107 at [76] per Simpson J.) As the High court said in Power (supra) at 628: 
      
       
        
         
         “To the extent to which deterrence is an object of imprisonment, then imprisonment without a chance of release for a longer time, rather than a shorter time, is within that objective.” 
         
        
       
     66 As Kirby P observed in R v Astill (No 2) (1992) 64 ACrimR 289 at 293: 
      
       
        
         
         “If every circumstance, particular to the case of each prisoner, were determined to be ‘special’ for the purpose of s5(2) so as to authorise a ratio in excess of the one-third there prescribed, the whole scheme of s5 would be undone. By judicial legislation, the intention of Parliament would be subverted.” 
         
        
       
     67 Where a circumstance is taken into account by way of reduction of the head sentence, the application of the statutory proportion will have the result that the circumstance also reduces the non-parole period. Before a sentencing judge further reduces the non-parole period by reason of that circumstance, he or she must undertake a process of analysis which travels beyond that which has been undertaken in the course of determining the head sentence. 
      
       
     68 I have indicated on other occasions my opinion that, in substance, it is artificial to approach this issue in two steps: first, making a preliminary finding that there are “special circumstances” and, thereafter, drawing a conclusion that those circumstances are such as to justify a lower than statutory proportion. (See e.g. R v Hampton (1998) 44 NSWLR 729 at 732F). I remain of that view. The only point in making a finding of “special circumstances” is to make the ‘decision’ for which s44 provides. By s44(2) the non-parole period is not to be less than three quarters of the head sentence “unless the court decides there are special circumstances for it being less”. This qualificatory clause requires a ‘decision’ by application of the composite requirement that the “circumstances” be sufficiently “special” for the statutory proportion to be reduced. 
      
       
     69 Section 44 of the 1999 Act, like s5 of the 1989 Act, operates as a fetter or constraint on the exercise of the sentencing discretion. It operates to guide the discretion in a particular manner. However, the case law does not justify a restrictive approach to the scope of considerations relevant to the determination by a court of what constitutes special circumstances in a particular case. 
      
       
     70 The legislature has long required sentencing judges in New South Wales to impose a non-parole period (or its equivalent) as a fixed relationship to the head sentence, unless the circumstances were such that the sentencing judge believed it appropriate to have a lower proportionate relationship. This statutory guide or fetter or constraint operates in one direction. It is a hurdle to be overcome if a lower proportion than that for which the statute provides is to be determined. There is no hurdle for a sentencing judge if that judge wishes to impose a higher than statutory proportion. Indeed, at all times the sentencing judge has had a discretion to impose a fixed term without a non-parole period of any character (now found in s45 of the 1999 Act).  
      
       
     71 The express obligation, in addition to any common law requirement, in both the 1989 Act and the 1999 Act to set out reasons for varying the statutory proportion indicates that the Parliament requires the relationship to be as stipulated unless there exists what Badgery-Parker J identified in Moffitt at 136C as “clear reasons … to the contrary”. 
      
       
     72 In the absence of the statutory proportion, the fixing of a non-parole period by a sentencing judge in New South Wales would, as in other States and Territories, involve an unfettered discretion. It would be open to challenge on the basis of legal error including, in terms of quantum alone, that it was manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate. This will also often be the primary issue in a “special circumstances” case in this Court. 
      
       
     73 One practical effect of the statutory proportion has been to create a field of disputation which enables matters of fact and judgment to be expressed as if they constituted propositions of law. This arises only because the fetter is expressed in words which suggest a legal standard. It will be a very rare case in which there is no fact capable as a matter of law, of constituting a “special circumstance”. The decision is first one of fact - to identify the circumstances - and, secondly, one of judgment - to determine that those circumstances justify a lower proportionate relationship between the non-parole period and the head sentence. There are well known restraints on an appellate court from interfering with decisions of this character. As a practical matter there are unlikely to be many cases in which this Court will interfere unless the non-parole period is found to be manifestly inadequate or manifestly excessive. 
      
       
        
       Determination of the Appeal 
       
     74 The Applicant’s submissions to the Court proceeded on the assumption that if he could identify some kind of error – either a failure to give proper weight to the plea, or a failure to state reasons with respect to the issue of special circumstances or a failure to make a finding of special circumstances that ought to have been made – then this Court would proceed to allow the appeal and re-sentence the Applicant. This assumption is not in accordance with the jurisdiction which this Court exercises.  
      
       
     75 The need to pay regard to the statutory jurisdiction exercised by a court of criminal appeal has recently been emphasised in Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321. Gleeson CJ and Hayne J said at [3]: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is of the first importance to identify the jurisdiction which the Court of Criminal Appeal exercises, the power the Court is given, and the circumstances in which those powers may be exercised.” 
         
        
       
     76 In that case the court was concerned with the jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal of Western Australia and specifically s689(3) of the Criminal Code (WA) which, relevantly, is in the same terms as s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 of this State, which provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “6(3) On an appeal under section 5(1) against a sentence, the court, if it is of opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefore, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal.” 
         
        
       
     77 In Dinsdale, Gleeson CJ and Hayne J referred to the well-known passage in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505 as identifying the appropriate approach to the determination of whether a relevant error was made in the context of exercising the sentencing discretion. 
      
       
     78 To similar effect are the observations of Gaudron and Gummow JJ in Dinsdale at [21]: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is common ground that, in this case, the Court of Criminal Appeal was empowered by s689(3) of the Code to quash the sentence passed at the appellant’s trial and to pass the increased sentence it imposed upon him, without an order for its suspension, ‘if they [thought] that a different sentence should have been passed’. Further, the respondent correctly accepted that the exercise of the powers conferred by s689(3) was conditioned upon the formation of an opinion by the Court of Criminal Appeal, a process to which there applied the reasoning of this Court (with respect to an appeal against sentence brought directly to this Court under s73 of the Constitution) in the joint judgment in House v The King [(1936) 55 CLR 499]. To that we would add that this opinion of the Court of Criminal Appeal must be expressed as well as formed, so that, to adapt a statement by McHugh JA in Soulemezis v Dudley Holdings Pty Ltd [(1987) 10 NSWLR 247 at 280], the essential ground or grounds for the formation of the opinion are articulated.” 
         
        
       
     79 Sentencing appeals in this Court frequently proceed as if the statutory trigger for the quashing of a sentence were expressed as follows: “If it is of the opinion that error has occurred in the sentencing process.” That is not the statutory formulation. By s6(3) this Court must form a positive opinion that “some other sentence … is warranted in law and should have been passed”. Unless such an opinion is formed, the essential pre-condition for the exercise of the power to “quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefore” is not satisfied. As the judgments in Dinsdale to which I have referred indicate, the exercise of the power in s6(3) further requires the identification of error in the requisite sense. 
      
       
     80 In the present case I do not believe there is any proper basis for the formation of an opinion in the statutory terms; the objective and subjective circumstances do not lead me to the conclusion that “some other sentence … is warranted in law and should have been passed”. The effective sentence imposed by his Honour on Count 7 of imprisonment for three years and six months with a non-parole period of two years and seven months was, in my opinion, entirely appropriate. 
      
       
     81 As noted above, the Applicant identified three errors in his Honour’s decision: 
      
       
       
       (i) Failure to give appropriate weight to the plea and failure to quantify the discount. 
        
        
       (ii) Inadequacy of reasons on special circumstances. 
        
        
       (iii) Failure to find special circumstances. 
        
       
     82 In Thomson & Houlton this Court encouraged sentencing judges to quantify the utilitarian value of the discount given for a plea, in order to serve the broader interests of the administration of criminal justice discussed in that case: 
      
       
        
         
         “Sentencing judges are encouraged to quantify the effect of the plea on the sentence insofar as they believe it appropriate to do so.”  
         (At [160] – see also at [113]) 
           
         
        
       
     83 His Honour’s failure to quantify the discount does not constitute an error. There is no reason to believe that his Honour failed to give appropriate weight to the plea. The sentences imposed are, in my opinion, entirely appropriate. 
      
       
     84 The Applicant’s submission that his Honour failed to give reasons for refusing to find special circumstances should, in my opinion, be rejected.  
      
       
     85 In R v Bo Too (NSWCCA, 16 July 1992, unreported) Hunt CJ at CL said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Where the evidence discloses the existence of material which (if accepted) could amount to special circumstances within the meaning of s5(2), but the sentencing judge does not vary the one third proportion required by that subsection, he or should would usually be expected to explain why. The absence of such an explanation may lead to the conclusion that no consideration was in fact given to whether that proportion should be varied …” 
         
        
       
     86 It may well be that, in accordance with some of the views his Honour expressed in other cases, his Honour had in mind a narrower range of “material” which “could amount to special circumstances” than the authorities I have discussed above indicate to be permissible. These words were used by his Honour as if they were words of limitation but, as a practical matter, they suggest an obligation to give reasons for not varying the statutory proportion in every case. There is no such obligation. 
      
       
     87 In R v Astill (No 2) (supra) at 301-302 Sully J indicated that this passage meant no more than a failure to “explain why” may, but will not necessarily, lead to a conclusion that the Court had not turned its mind to the issue of special circumstances. I agree. 
      
       
     88 In my opinion, in view of the wide range of considerations that are capable of constituting “special circumstances”, a failure to “explain” why the statutory proportion was not varied will not readily be accepted as a basis for an inference that the sentencing judge did not turn his or her mind to the issue. It cannot do so where, as here, the sentencing judge makes the express reference that Judge Gibson made here: 
      
       
        
         
         “I see no reason to find special circumstances in this case.” 
         
        
       
     89 The Applicant submitted that this reference contained some form of ambiguity in that it was not clear whether his Honour was adopting a restrictive view of special circumstances by saying that none of the facts and matters he had referred to were capable, as a matter of law, of constituting special circumstances or, whether, on the other hand, his Honour accepted that the matters were capable of constituting special circumstances but found that, in the circumstances of the case, they were not sufficiently “special” to conclude that the statutory relationship should be varied. 
      
       
     90 Decisions on sentencing matters by District Court judges should not be analysed so finely. (See R v Majors (1991) 54 ACrimR 334 at 338.) The suggestion of ambiguity in the Applicant’s submissions is to manufacture an error in his Honour’s reasons which nothing in his Honour’s reasons warrants. 
      
       
     91 The Applicant sought to draw some support from the fact that the sentence that I have quoted above appears immediately after his Honour’s treatment of the issue of mitigation by reason of assistance to the authorities. I reject the suggestion that his Honour may only have been referring to the subject matter he was considering in the paragraphs immediately before the reference to “special circumstances”. In the pages prior to that reference, his Honour had referred expressly to the various reports that were before him and to all of the matters which the Applicant asked this Court to take into account in order to make a finding of special circumstances.  
      
       
     92 In my opinion, his Honour’s reasons should be understood to say that all of the facts and matters to which he had earlier referred did not constitute a sufficient “reason to find” special circumstances. His Honour was entitled to make a judgment of that character. No error is suggested which would entitle this Court to intervene. 
      
       
     93 The factors which, in combination, were said to constitute special circumstances in this case included the express finding by the sentencing judge of good prospects for rehabilitation and a number of subjective considerations: few prior offences, a stable relationship, the effects of the car accident, etc. I find nothing particularly special about this combination of circumstances. Indeed they seem to me to be quite unremarkable. They are all considerations entitled to weight in determining the head sentence and have, no doubt, led to a lower head sentence and, therefore, to a lower non-parole period, than would have been imposed in their absence. It is by no means clear to me that they would, even in combination, permit a finding of special circumstances. I am quite satisfied that they do not require such a finding. There is no error by the sentencing judge which justifies the intervention of this Court. 
      
       
     94 Leave to appeal should be given but the appeal dismissed. 
      
       
     95 MASON P: I agree with the Chief Justice. 
      
       
     96 GROVE J: I agree with Spigelman CJ. 
      
       
     97 SULLY J: I have read in draft the judgment of the Chief Justice. I agree with the orders proposed by his Honour. As to the merits of the particular application of Mr. Simpson, I do not wish to add to what the Chief Justice has said. 
      
       
     98 I do wish, however, to add some observations of my own as to some of the other matters upon which the judgment of the Chief Justice touches.  
      
       
     99 Whenever an applicant for leave to appeal against sentence submits that there is cause to show why this Court should intervene and reduce the primary sentence, it is, as I think, obvious that the first thing to be established by the applicant is that the primary sentencing discretion has miscarried, by reason of some error of fact or of law; or because of the cumulative effect of errors of both fact and law. The errors, whether of fact or of law, may be either latent or patent; but whether latent or patent, some error must be demonstrated before this Court becomes entitled at all to consider interfering with the sentence passed at first instance: Vachalec [1981] 1NSWLR 351 at 353F; Visconti [1982] 2 NSWLR 104 at 108G. 
      
       
     100 Error once demonstrated, it does not follow automatically that this Court will, without more, intervene in fact and resentence. Before that can happen properly in law, the condition specified in s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) must be satisfied: that is to say, this Court must be persuaded, not only that error has been shown in the process of reasoning of the primary sentencing Court, but that some other sentence is ""warranted in law"".  I agree with the observations made in this connection by Lee AJ in Astill (No 2) [1992] 64 ACrimR 289 at 303, 304. 
      
       
     101 As to the matter of ""special circumstances"", as contemplated by s44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), I would make the following observations: 
      
       
        
       1. Before any question of special circumstances arises at all, there must first be determined a proper head sentence, and a proper accompanying non-parole period. By  
       ""proper"" 
        I mean proper having regard to a correct definition of the relevant objective facts and the relevant subjective factors; and to a correct striking of a balance between those two categories of matters. 
        
        
       2. The striking of that correct balance is not to be conceptualised, or to be approached practically, in some hyper-refined or hair-splitting kind of way. Sentencing is neither a science nor a mere exercise in creative mathematics. Sentencing is an art, the proper manifestation of which brings judgment based upon learning and experience to bear upon given facts and circumstances so as to achieve a result that expresses in the particular case a just resolution of the competing interests, public and private, that are described by Sir John Barry in the passages which are quoted from his paper  
       ""The Courts and Criminal Punishment""  
       by McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ in their joint judgment in  
       Pearce v The Queen  
       [1998] 194 CLR 610 at 623, 624 
       . 
        
        
       3. Once that balance has been struck, correctly in law and soundly in fact, then  
       prima facie  
       the proportion which the determined non-parole period bears to the determined head sentence is  
       ex hypothesi  
       correct. 
        
        
       4. Should it happen that the proportion thus resulting is three-quarters or more, then there is no call to consider  
       ""special circumstances"" 
       . It is only in the case where the proportion proposed computes at less than three-quarters that it becomes necessary  
       either  
       to redetermine the proposed head sentence and non-parole period so as to yield a proportion of not less than three-quarters;  
       or  
       to identify correctly in law and soundly in fact,  
       ""special circumstances"" 
        that justify the reduction of the non-parole period so that its proportion to the proposed head sentence is less than three-quarters. 
        
        
       5. I have no quarrel with the proposition that it is difficult, if not impossible, in practice, and as well undesirable in principle, to attempt some all-embracing definition of what can, and what cannot, satisfy the notion of  
       ""special circumstances"" 
       . But it does not follow, in my opinion, that it is correct in principle to say that in any and every particular case, the subjective matters that have been factored correctly into the definition of a head sentence and a non-parole period, can simply be regurgitated as  
       ""special circumstances"" 
       , so as to require a reduction in what would be, otherwise, a proper non-parole period. Relevant subjective factors and  
       ""special circumstances""  
       are not simple synonyms. They are discrete considerations. Each has its own proper place in the framing of a proper sentence; but neither is ever to be allowed to produce a result that does not adequately, (and to quote from Sir John Barry's paper earlier herein mentioned):  
       ""... reflect and correspond with the sensible ideas about right and wrong of the society …"" 
        for the protection of which the particular sentence is being passed at all. It is worth reiterating the following additional observations of Sir John Barry, which he applies to the criminal law generally, but which have a special relevance in connection with the art of sentencing:  
        
        
         
          
           
           ""[It] must be operated within society as a going concern. To achieve even a minimal degree of effectiveness, it should avoid excessive subtleties and refinements. It must be administered publicly in such a fashion that its activities can be understood by ordinary citizens and regarded by them as conforming with the community's generally accepted standards of what is fair and just."" 
           
          
         
        
       
     102 I do not propose to take time to consider in any extended philosophical way whether or not what I have said in the foregoing numbered paragraphs contradicts in any essential respect the reasoning of the Chief Justice. If it be thought that there is some such incompatibility between my reasoning and that of the Chief Justice, then, with all proper respect, I adhere to what I have written. Otherwise, I agree with the reasoning of the Chief Justice. 
      
       
     103 NEWMAN AJ: I agree with the Chief Justice.

     3 Barr J: This is a Crown appeal against sentences imposed upon the Respondent in the District Court. On 3 November 2000 he pleaded guilty to charges that - 
      
       
        
         
         (i) On 29 October 1997 he dishonestly obtained for himself $30,000 
          
         by deception, namely by electronic transfer of funds from his employer’s bank account to his own bank account; 
          
         (ii) On 29 October 1997 he engaged in a transaction, namely the purchase of a motor vehicle, with money which he knew was the proceeds of a serious offence;  
          
         (iii) On 15 February 1998 he dishonestly obtained for himself a financial advantage, namely $10,000, by deception, namely by swiping his bank card into an electronic machine belonging to a shop, thereby creating a refund transaction for his own credit; 
          
         (iv) On 27 February 1998 he dishonestly obtained for himself money, namely $30,000, by deception, namely the unauthorised transfer of funds from the bank account of another organisation to his own bank account; 
          
         (v) On 28 February 1998 he engaged in a transaction, namely the purchase of a number of electrical components worth $3,000, knowing that the money used was the proceeds of a serious offence; and  
          
         (vi) On 2 March 1998 he engaged in a transaction, namely the purchase of some car wheels worth $1,460, with money that he knew was the proceeds of a serious offence. 
         
        
       
     4 He was sentenced on the first, third and fourth counts to concurrent sentences of two years six months’ imprisonment, commencing on 17 July 2000 and expiring on 16 January 2003. A non-parole period of sixteen weeks and one day was fixed, commencing on 17 July 2000 and expiring on 7 November 2000. The sentencing judge declared that the respondent would be eligible for parole but that it would be a condition of parole that he be admitted to the residential gambling rehabilitation course conducted by the Salvation Army at the William Booth Institute. It was a further condition that he remain in the programme at that Institute and that on completion he submit himself to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service, attend courses and undertake such treatment and do such other things as the Service should require. 
      
       
     5 On the remaining counts the sentencing judge imposed concurrent fixed terms of three months’ imprisonment commencing on 17 July 2000 and expiring on 16 October 2000. 
      
       
     6 The facts, a statement of which was put before the sentencing judge, may be summarised as follows. Between 30 September and 29 October 1997 the respondent was a temporary employee of a company, Gupta’s Communication Pty Ltd, which operated a mobile phone franchise at Neutral Bay. The business had an EFTPOS facility for electronic credit card purchases. It was necessary for refunds to be made to customers’ accounts from time to time, and they could be effected through the same facility. In that way credits could be passed directly to customers’ bank accounts. On 29 October 1997 the respondent used the EFTPOS machine to process four credits into his own bank account, totalling $32, 000. He had no permission to do so and was not entitled to the money. On the same day he withdrew the money from his account and used $29,000 of it to buy a motor vehicle. 
      
       
     7 On 15 February 1998 he entered a telecommunications shop in Haymarket, Sydney and engaged the shop assistant in conversation. Other customers entered the shop and the assistant went to attend to them. The respondent went to the EFTPOS machine and used a card issued to him by a bank in order to process a refund of $10,000 from the shop business to his personal savings account. He did this by entering into the EFTPOS terminal what he knew to be a password routinely issued by the bank on delivery of such machines. He later removed this money or most of it from his account. 
      
       
     8 He befriended Miss Rima Nigroh, an employee of another telecommunications business at St. Leonards. He told her how he had been diverting money to his bank account by the use of EFTPOS machines. He said that he wanted to remove $50,000 from Miss Nigroh’s employer’s business into his account and offered her $25,000 for her assistance. She agreed to help. On the evening of 27 February Miss Nigroh entered her employer’s premises and told a lie to trick the only employee present into leaving the building. Then she let in the respondent. He used the company’s EFTPOS machine to transfer $30,000 into his bank account. He later withdrew most of that money.  
      
       
     9 On the following day he used part of the money to buy electrical equipment for fitment to his car and on 2 March 1998 he used further money from the same source to buy chrome car wheels. 
      
       
     10 Miss Nigroh admitted her part in the deception of her employer and pleaded guilty to obtaining money, a valuable thing or a financial advantage by deception. She was given the benefit of a two-year bond to be of good behaviour. Her statement was put before the sentencing judge. 
      
       
     11 The respondent was born on 28 August 1973, so he was twenty-four years old when he committed the offences. He was twenty–seven years old when sentenced. He was arrested on 25 December 1997, charged with the first two counts and granted bail. He committed the other offences whilst on bail. He was in custody for unrelated offences between 9 June and 14 August 1998. During that period he was arrested and charged with the fourth, fifth and sixth counts the subject of this appeal. On 13 August 1998 he was granted bail on those counts. On 8 September 1998 he was charged with the third count and granted bail. On 12 March 1999 he was committed for trial. On 6 September 1999 he failed to appear for trial at the District Court. He was arrested on 9 September 1999. On 13 September 1999 he was granted bail, which he entered two days later. On 8 May 2000 he again failed to appear for trial. He was arrested on 17 July 2000 and remained in custody until sentenced by his Honour.  
      
       
     12 The respondent gave evidence before his Honour. He said that he had been born and educated overseas and had come to Australia with his family in 1994 and settled here. He had held a range of jobs. His Honour found that the respondent had been a compulsive gambler since 1996. At a time which was not specified he had spent a period of about three months in custody on remand, charged with offences unrelated to the ones now under consideration. Eventually those charges were dismissed, but whilst the applicant was being held in police cells he was assaulted. He told his Honour that he was still suffering from the resulting back pain. He said that he was being held on protection, though that must have been at his own request, because there was no suggestion of any particular contemporary danger. 
      
       
     13 The applicant said that it was his fear of custody, engendered by the assault and its consequences, that made him decide not to appear for trial on 8 May 2000. He did not explain why he had failed to appear in 1999. 
      
       
     14 The applicant told his Honour that he had been reporting daily to the police station as a condition of his bail. In that regard his evidence was only partly true. The conditions of his bail granted on 13 August 1998 did require daily reporting, but they were varied on 23 April 1999 to require reporting on only three days per week.  
      
       
     15 The respondent said that he was ashamed of what he had done. He had formed a relationship with a young woman, then of eighteen months’ duration. Under the influence of that relationship his gambling had dramatically decreased, though it had not ceased. He wanted to stop gambling. He had stopped offending. He wanted to enter the ten-month residential programme offered at the William Booth Institute.  
      
       
     16 There was no evidence to suggest that the applicant had committed any offences before he began residing in Australia. Since 1997 he had been convicted of a number of offences of dishonesty, including seven counts of stealing or embezzling from his employer, three of obtaining a benefit by deception, four of stealing or receiving and two of stealing motor vehicles, all or any of which might have been linked to the respondent’s desire to gamble. There were others, however, with no such apparent connection, namely six offences of driving whilst cancelled or disqualified, two of fraudulently altering or using number plates and three of stating a false name and place of abode. The respondent’s aliases incorporated seven different dates of birth. 
      
       
     17 A pre-sentence report was put before his Honour. The reporter noted that the respondent had strong family support and that he had seen a gambling counsellor. His desire to enter the William Booth programme was noted. It was said that he has some insight into his offences. His remorse appeared genuine to the reporter. 
      
       
     18 His Honour accepted as genuine the respondent’s desire to cure himself of his addiction to gambling. He referred to some remarks of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Eastway, an unreported decision of this Court of 19 May 1992 in which His Honour spoke about the relative strictures of custodial sentences and residential rehabilitation programmes, then to R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 where, his Honour said, the Court made an allowance of seventy-five percent where a person was living under very close police surveillance. His Honour said that he had dealt with the matter in such detail because he proposed to impose a sentence which was commensurate with the seriousness of the offences and for the purposes of general deterrence. 
      
       
     19 His Honour noted the respondent’s desire for rehabilitation, that for a considerable period of time he had reported daily on bail, and that he was being held in strict (sic) protection and concluded that these circumstances justified the fixing of a non-parole period of less than three quarters of the term of the sentences. Accordingly, his Honour fixed on the longer sentences a non-parole period which commenced when the respondent was returned to custody and expired four days after the day on which the sentences were imposed.  
      
       
     20 On appeal the Crown made no complaint about the head sentences or about his Honour’s finding that the circumstances combined to produce the need for a longer period of parole than one-quarter of the effective head sentence. The Crown submitted that the magnitude of the reduction of the non-parole period on that account had produced a sentence which was so manifestly inadequate as to disclose an error of principle. It was submitted that his Honour showed insufficient regard for general deterrence.  
      
       
     21 The non-parole period without reduction under s 44 (2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act would have been one year ten and one-half months. Other than noting the circumstances found to warrant the reduction of the non-parole period, his Honour gave no explanation why he was imposing such an extraordinarily short non-parole period.  
      
       
     22 The Court was referred to a number of cases which were said to show that, exceptionally, I think, the fact that an offence is committed to feed a gambling habit may operate to mitigate criminality, namely R v Calvert Court of Criminal Appeal, New South Wales 18 February 1993 unreported; R v O’Neill Court of Criminal Appeal, New South Wales unreported 24 July 1996; R v Brillo Court of Criminal Appeal, New South Wales unreported 14 May 1997; R v Molesworth [1999] NSWCCA 43; R v Fischer [2001] NSWCCA 143. Allowing that such exceptional cases may exist, however, I do not think it necessary to decide whether this may have been one of them, because in my opinion the non-parole period was in any case inadequate.  
      
       
     23 I infer from his Honour’s express recognition of the need to impose a deterrent sentence and his fixing a non-parole period of only sixteen weeks and one day that his Honour was of the view that it was only the head sentence which should be concerned with general deterrence. If that was his Honour’s view it was erroneous. The non-parole period is the minimum time the sentencing court determines justice requires that an offender must serve, having regard to all the circumstances of the offence, including its objective seriousness: Bugmy v The Queen (1990) 169 CLR 525.  
      
       
     24 In my opinion his Honour failed in fixing the non-parole period to give proper weight to the objective seriousness of the offences, including that most of them were committed whilst on bail, some constituted serious breaches of trust and all were repeated offences of their kind. Neither, I think, did the non-parole period take any account of the need to deter the respondent himself from repeating offences of a like kind.  
      
       
     25 The resulting non-parole period fell so short of an appropriately deterrent sentence that, having in mind the caution with which this Court should approach Crown appeals, I think that the sentences should be disturbed. 
      
       
     26 Two circumstances exist which might enliven the Court’s discretion not to interfere with the sentences in spite of their inadequacy. First, because the respondent was released from custody at the end of the non-parole period fixed by his Honour, the imposition by this Court of a longer non-parole period would ordinarily have resulted in the return of the respondent to custody. The Court is ordinarily cautious about allowing Crown appeals where the resulting sentence would have such an effect. Here the principle does not operate, however, because in the circumstances which I shall summarise the respondent has already been returned to custody because of his breach of the conditions of his parole, something entirely of his own making. 
      
       
     27 The second circumstance is the late service of the Notice of Appeal upon the respondent.  
      
       
     28 His Honour sentenced the respondent on 3 November 2000. On 14 November the respondent was handed a letter informing him that the Director of Public Prosecutions was considering an appeal against the sentences. On the next day he telephoned a solicitor in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and told him that he had been refused entry to the residential course at the William Booth Centre and that his residential address would be 22 Frazer Avenue Lurnea. In due course the Director signed a Notice of Appeal and a solicitor in his office sent it together with associated documents under cover of a letter of 28 November 2000 to the officer in charge of the police station at Liverpool. The letter required immediate service of the Director’s letter and of a copy of the Notice of Appeal. It became the duty of Sergeant Anthony McLean to serve the documents. The covering letter correctly stated the respondent’s address. So did a letter informing the respondent that the Director had lodged an appeal. A copy of that letter, to which were added provisions for the respondent’s signature and particulars of his legal representative, incorrectly stated the respondent’s address as 27 Frazer Avenue, Lurnea. 
      
       
     29 Sergeant McLean did not serve the Director’s letter or the copy of the Notice of Appeal. The respondent was arrested on 14 June 2001 and returned to custody. He was handed a copy of the notice of appeal in June or July 2001 during the period of that custody.  
      
       
     30 Two affidavits of Sergeant McLean were read on the hearing of the appeal and he gave oral evidence and was cross-examined. In his affidavit of 19 September 2001 he said that he had received the copy of the Notice of Appeal for service on the respondent at 27 Frazer Avenue Lurnea and went on to describe his attempts to serve it there. On 28 October 2001 counsel for the respondent signed written submissions drawing attention to the discrepancy between that address and the address at which the respondent had told the solicitor that he would be living. The Crown responded by having Sergeant McLean swear a further affidavit on 29 October 2001. In it he said that he had erred in describing the address at which he had attempted service as 27 Frazer Avenue. It was 22 Frazer Avenue. He had not attended 27 Frazer Avenue. He told the Court that he had used a document sent to him by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to refresh his memory in preparing his affidavit. The document had stated the incorrect address. In that regard, his evidence received support from the copy of the Director’s letter to which I have already referred and which stated the wrong address. It seems clear that on some of its documents the Office of the DPP had recorded the respondent’s correct address and on others the incorrect address. Sergeant McLean said that before attempting to serve documents on the respondent he had obtained an address from police records as well as some photographs of the respondent. Finally, he told that Court that on the evening before the hearing of the appeal he had visited Frazer Avenue, Lurnea. He had looked at the houses numbered 22 and 27 respectively. He reiterated that it was at number 22 that he had tried to effect service. 
      
       
     31 In my opinion the further affidavit and the oral evidence of Sergeant McLean explain the discrepancy and I am satisfied that it was at the respondent’s residential address, 22 Frazer Avenue, Lurnea, that he attended in order to try to effect service of the Director’s letter and of a copy of the Notice of Appeal. 
      
       
     32 In his affidavit of 19 September 2001 and in his oral evidence Sergeant McLean said that between 8 and 18 December 2000 he attended the address on five or six occasions. The front door was open but the wire door was closed. He could hear people inside but could not get anyone to respond to his calls. On the last occasion before 18 December 2000 he was greeted at the door by a man. He told the man that he was looking for the respondent to serve a summons in a matter of an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal. He thought that he might have said that it was about a drink driving matter but he could have been mistaken about that. The man told him that he was the respondent’s father. He said that the respondent was working at Sports Car Rentals in the Kings Cross area. After that date, said Sergeant McLean, he attended the vicinity of the house on a number of occasions, both early in the morning and at night and watched the house. He never saw the respondent entering or leaving the premises. 
      
       
     33 The respondent swore an affidavit on 31 October 2001 and gave oral evidence on the appeal. He said that he was living at 22 Frazer Avenue, Lurnea at all relevant times and denied having avoided service. He said that he had moved to and from those premises during the relevant period of time. 
      
       
     34 It is necessary for the Crown in bringing an appeal to comply strictly with all relevant requirements: Malvaso v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 227. However, there is no requirement in the Criminal Appeal Act or the Rules for service by the Crown of a Notice of Appeal on a respondent or for service in any particular manner. There is no provision for substituted service. 
      
       
     35 Rules 73, 74 and 75 Criminal Appeal Rules appear under the heading Service of Orders and Notices. They are in these terms - 
      
       
       
        
         
       73 Service by police officer  
        
         
         Where personal service of any order or other documents is required, the Commissioner of Police shall, at the request of the Registrar, cause such order or other document to be served by one of his officers. 
         
        
        
         
         74 Service by post  
          
         Any notice or other document, of which personal service is not required by any rule or direction of the Court, may be served by post. 
         
        
        
         
         75 Time of service of notice of appeal or application  
          
         Any notice of appeal, or of any application to the Court by an appellant in custody, shall be deemed to have been given at the time when it is delivered for posting to the officer of the gaol where the appellant is imprisoned, and the time of such delivery shall be indorsed thereon by such officer. 
         
        
       
     36 Rule 75 was promulgated (as Rule 74) on the original publication of the Rules on 15 July 1912, a time before s 5D Criminal Appeal Act was enacted to give the Crown the right of appeal against a sentence. The Regulations have never been amended to deal with the service of Crown appeals.  
      
       
     37 The Court was told that the practice of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is to have all such notices personally served. That, it seems to me, is a sound practice. I think that the question that arises here is whether in all the circumstances the Crown has acted reasonably. 
      
       
     38 It seems to me that the Crown did do all that could reasonably have been required to effect service of the Notice of Appeal personally on the respondent. I think that the respondent would have received official notification of the appeal within a reasonable time after the imposition of sentence if he had not deliberately avoided service. My reasons for coming to this conclusion are as follows.  
      
       
     39 It strikes me as unusual that in all but one of the five or six visits Sergeant McLean made to the respondent’s residence, all made on occasions when there were people in the house, he should have been unable to draw any response at all. On the one occasion when he could draw forth a response the respondent was not there. It is also unusual that the officer should have seen no sign of the respondent near his residence on occasions when he might have been expected to be seen leaving for work or returning from work. The evidence of Sergeant McLean, which I accept, suggests that the respondent was deliberately keeping out of sight in order to avoid being served with the Notice of Appeal which he had good reason to expect had been filed.  
      
       
     40 I am fortified in my conclusions by evidence of the several occasions on which the respondent otherwise deliberately acted so as to frustrate the criminal proceedings which he knew were being brought against him or to refuse to comply with his obligations, in all cases to avoid the risk of being ordered to serve a custodial sentence. The admitted occasions were as follows -  
      
       
        
         
         (i) On 6 September 1999 he deliberately did not attend for his trial; 
         
        
        
        (ii) On 8 May 2000 he deliberately did not attend for his trial; 
        
        
         
         (iii) He ceased to report to his parole officer, Ms Haddad, because he knew, as she had told him, that there were warrants out for his arrest. 
         
        
        
       On each of these occasions his reason for breaching his bail or parole obligation was to avoid, as he saw it, the risk of being sent to gaol. 
        
       
     41 There are other reasons why I would not accept the denials of the respondent that he acted deliberately to avoid being spoken to by Sergeant McLean. His record shows that he is a person who will resort to untruths when he sees an advantage for himself in doing so. He was cross-examined about his failure to report to the William Booth Institute or the Probation and Parole Service on the day of his release at the expiry of his non-parole period. He said that he did not go the William Booth Institute because his Honour’s order was that he be escorted from the prison to that Institute upon his release.  
      
       
     42 The transcript shows that his Honour said this - 
      
       
        
         
         You will be released on parole next week but it will be a condition that Corrective Services will take you to the William Booth Institute… 
         
        
       
     43 The respondent said that he was standing outside the gaol from 2:30 or 3 o’clock in the afternoon. He was waiting a couple of hours and no one showed up to escort him.  
      
       
     44 He conceded that he was told by the officers at the gaol that no one from the Corrective Services Department would escort him and that he should make his own way to the William Booth Institute. Then his evidence changed and he said that he did not get released until 3:30, and had to be at the William Booth Institute by 4 o’clock. He was asked whether he had not previously said in his evidence that he had been released at 2:30 in the afternoon. He answered that Long Bay prison was separated into a lot of sections, that at 2:30 he was still inside the prison and that that was the time at which he signed the paper work. He left the door (of the section he was then in) at 3 o’clock. He did not get released until 3:30.  
      
       
     45 I think that the respondent was changing his evidence in a manner that he thought would suit his case better.  
      
       
     46 The delay between his Honour’s orders and service of the Notice of Appeal was well over seven months. After such a delay, the Court would normally exercise its discretion not to interfere in a sentence, notwithstanding the merits otherwise of the appeal. This, however, is an extraordinary case. I think that the discretion of the Court should be exercised in favour of interfering with the sentences because of the following circumstances - 
      
       
        
         
         (i) The respondent knew on 14 November 2000, eleven days after sentence, that the Director was considering bringing an appeal. 
         
        
        
        (ii) As I infer, he believed that the Director probably would appeal. 
        
        
        (iii) He avoided service of the Notice of Appeal. 
        
        
         
         (iv) The delay did not affect the respondent’s ability to deal with the substance of the appeal. 
         
        
       
     47 The Crown submitted that if it re-sentenced the respondent the Court should fix a non-parole period of less that three quarters of the head sentence for the reasons articulated by his Honour.  
      
       
     48 The evidence about what has happened to the respondent since sentence throws doubt upon his expressed commitment to cure his gambling problem. Although appointments were made for him to see a specialist gambling counsellor at the Australian Arabic Communities Council he failed to keep them. As I have already observed, he withdrew himself from supervision by the Probation and Parole Service. That was what led to the revocation of his parole. Even so, it seems that all his actions have recently been coloured by his fear of prison and there may be some reason to suppose that once he has served a term of custody he will approach the question of his rehabilitation in a more realistic and constructive fashion, especially if, as he now realises, the failure to do so may again result in a revocation of his parole. I would make orders to substitute a head sentence of two years six months equally divided between non-parole and parole periods. I would make it a condition of his parole that he complete the William Booth Institute course. 
      
       
     49 The respondent served sixteen weeks one day of his sentence before being released to parole. He was re-arrested on 14 June 2001 and has been held in custody since that day, effectively serving the sentences imposed by his Honour. The simplest way to deal with the matter seems to be to date the new period of two years six months to commence on the day falling sixteen weeks and one day before 14 June 2001. I propose the following orders - 
      
       
        
         
         Allow the appeal. 
         
        
        
         
         Quash the sentences imposed on the first, third and fourth counts and in lieu on each such count sentence the respondent to imprisonment for a period of two years six months commencing on 21 February 2001 and expiring on 20 August 2003. 
         
        
        
         
         Fix a non-parole period on each sentence of one year three months, expiring on 20 May 2002, on which day the respondent is directed to be released on parole. It will be a condition of parole that he report within 48 hours of his release to the officer in charge of the gambling rehabilitation programme conducted by the Salvation Army at the William Booth Institute, that he then apply forthwith to enter that programme, that he enter it as soon as there is a vacancy for him and that he use his best endeavours to complete the programme. 
         
        
        
         
         The reason for fixing a non-parole period which is less than three quarters of the head sentences is the respondent’s need to rehabilitate himself under supervision.

      HIS HONOUR:  
       
       
      INTRODUCTION 
      
    1 Ali Khalouf (the prisoner) was arraigned on 6 October 2000 on a charge of having murdered Rebecca Diab (Mrs Diab) at Bass Hill in the State of New South Wales on or about 18 February 2000. He pleaded not guilty. The date originally fixed for the trial was vacated and a new date of commencement fixed for 13 July 2001. On that date application was made on behalf of the prisoner for an adjournment for a short period to enable other counsel to be brought into the matter. That application was acceded to and the trial was adjourned until 23 July 2001, on which date the prisoner maintained his plea of not guilty and the trial commenced. 
     
      
    2 On 10 August 2001 the jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder and the prisoner was remanded in custody to a date to be fixed so as to enable the Crown to obtain a pre-sentence report and the Crown and the defence to prepare for a hearing on sentence. This took place on 15 November 2001. 
     
      
    3 At the sentence hearing the Crown tendered a pre-sentence report prepared by an officer of the Corrective Services Department, and several victim impact statements. Counsel for the defence elected not to call the prisoner or any other evidence on behalf of the prisoner.  
     
      
       
      THE ONUS AND STANDARD OF PROOF 
      
    4 The decision of the court on sentence is an important matter for a prisoner. It has often been said that in some instances it is no less important than the decision as to the guilt or otherwise of the prisoner. The standard of proof in a sentencing hearing is the same as it is in a trial, namely proof beyond reasonable doubt. This standard applies to any disputed facts which are not covered by the verdict of guilty. In Regina v Storey (1997) 89 A Crim R 519 a specially constituted Court of Criminal Appeal in Victoria confirmed this statement of the law. Winneke P, Brooking and Hayne JJA and Southwell AJA said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The judge may not take facts into account in a way that is adverse to the interests of the accused unless those facts have been established beyond reasonable doubt. On the other hand, if there are circumstances which the judge proposes to take into account in favour of the accused, it is enough if those circumstances are proved on the balance of probabilities” (at 530) 
        
       
      
    5 In determining what facts are adverse to the interests of the prisoner and what are favourable, the Court must ask what the tendency of the facts is in the particular case under consideration. As was said in Regina v Storey (supra): 
     
      
       
        
        “’Aggravating’ and ‘mitigating’ must be understood in a wide sense and without, eg, drawing the distinction which might be drawn between the significance for another purpose on the one hand of a circumstance which renders the crime more serious (eg, the use of a weapon) or on the other hand of a prior or subsequent conviction. 
        
       
       
        
        The test is not what tag should be applied to any particular fact but what use the judge proposes to make of the fact in relation to the offender. If it is a use adverse to the interests of the offender then proof beyond reasonable doubt is required; if it is a use in favour of the offender then proof on the balance of probabilities will suffice.” 
        
       
       
      and: 
       
       
        
        “We have spoken of disputed ’facts’ … there may be a large number of facts which it is contended demonstrate a relevant conclusion. Just as on a trial the Crown does not have to prove every fact on which it relies beyond reasonable doubt in order to conclude that the offence is proved, so too on sentencing, attention must be directed to the relevant issue and it is the issue that must be established to the requisite standard – not each of the individual facts which is said to bear upon the issue.” (supra at 531 – 532) 
        
       
      
    6 The law of New South Wales accords with these statements. (Regina v Isaacs (1997) 90 A Crim R 587 at 592.) 
     
      
    7 In determining, as I must, the facts on which the sentence is to be imposed upon the prisoner in this case (Savvas v The Queen (1995) 183 CLR 1) I have applied the law as set out above in the light of the verdict of the jury. 
     
      
      
      STATUTORY MATTERS 
       
      
    8 The penalty provided for murder in s 19A(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 is imprisonment for life. However the Court is empowered to impose a lesser term (Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 21).9 Considerations of retribution, deterrence and rehabilitation are material to the sentencing of the prisoner. 
     
      
    10 The Crimes (Sentencing Procedures) Act 1999 makes provision for regard to be had to a number of considerations. These include the nature, extent, significance and usefulness of the assistance given by the offender to the authorities, the truthfulness, completeness and reliability of any information or evidence provided by the offender, the timeliness of any such assistance and the likelihood as to whether or not the offender will commit further offences after release (s 23). In addition in imposing a sentence the Court must take into account any time which the offender has spent in custody in relation to the particular offence (s 24(a)). Furthermore, the age and antecedents of the prisoner are relevant considerations. So too is the effect of the offence on the victim and the family of the victim, but this is to be understood in the manner defined in the decided cases. 
     
      
       
       
      THE MURDER - FACTS 
      
    11 Mrs Diab was killed late on the night of 17 February 2000 in room 506 at the Rydges Hotel at Bass Hill. She was dead before midnight. The evidence of Mrs Mughelli makes this clear. She was in the room next door to the room occupied by Mrs Diab and the prisoner. She was particularly well placed to hear what was going on in the next room and was an acute and intelligent person whose memory of events was good. Her evidence, which I accept, establishes that throughout the period between approximately 10.30pm and 11.45pm on the night in question, she heard raised voices - one male, one female. There was yelling and shouting. It was loud enough for her to hear it over the television which was playing in her room. However, although she could hear it, she was not able to understand what was being said, since it was in a foreign language. At about 11pm, she heard the shower in room 506 start up. The sound of the shower continued for nearly 30 minutes, but the argument did not cease. It was sufficiently disturbing for her to plan to knock on the door of room 506 to ask the occupants to be quiet. Then, at about 11.45pm, everything became quiet in room 506. Mrs Mughelli fell asleep and remained asleep until about 2.30am on 18 February 2000. She then woke to hear a man’s voice coming from room 506. His voice was raised, yelling, but she was unable to understand what he was saying because it was in a foreign language. The man’s voice was the same as that which she had heard engaged in the argument with the woman, however she did not hear the woman’s voice at any time after about 11.45pm.  
     
      
    12 The raised male voice which Mrs Mughelli heard was undoubtedly that of the prisoner; the female voice that of the Mrs Diab. The voice which Mrs Mughelli heard at approximately 2.30am was again undoubtedly that of the prisoner. It was when he was speaking on the telephone. The phone records and other evidence confirm that a telephone call took place at this time. Such evidence supports the accuracy of Mrs Mughelli’s recollection.  
     
      
    13 From the foregoing, I am satisfied that the prisoner had killed Mrs Diab by approximately 11.45pm on the evening of 17 February 2000.14 Mrs Diab’s death was the result of a large number of stab wounds that had been inflicted upon her by the prisoner. The more serious wounds were concentrated in the area of her throat, central thorax and slightly below the central thorax in areas in which there were vital organs. The conclusion expressed by the forensic pathologist, Dr Lee, was that the wounds demonstrated some 12 applications of force to Mrs Diab’s body with a knife. Her jugular vein had been severed, her carotid artery breached, her liver punctured and her vertebral column damaged. Some of the injuries inflicted by the wounds were by their very nature certain to be fatal. The force required to effect the damage to her vertebral column was substantial, indeed sufficient to damage the knife which was used to cause that injury.  
     
      
    15 The immediate cause of Mrs Diab’s death was loss of blood as a consequence of her stab wounds. According to Dr Lee death would have been mercifully quick once Mrs Diab’s jugular vein had been severed or her carotid artery breached in the way in which it was. Death would have come within a matter of minutes, perhaps a couple of minutes at most. Unconsciousness would have come even more quickly. This would have occurred within a matter of seconds once the major wounds had been inflicted.  
     
      
    16 The evidence of Dr Lee also establishes that there had been fourteen applications of force with a knife to Mrs Diab’s hands and arms. These wounds were sustained when Mrs Diab sought to defend herself from the attack on her by the prisoner.  
     
      
    17 The forensic evidence was that all the wounds sustained by Mrs Diab had been inflicted by the knife which was found at the scene of the murder. It had been purchased by the prisoner during the early afternoon of the murder.  
     
      
    18 The evidence of Dr Lee was powerful and unchallenged. I accept it.  
     
      
    19 The circumstances immediately before Mrs Diab was killed clearly involved an argument in which both the prisoner and Mrs Diab were engaged. The picture which clearly emerges from the evidence of Mrs Mughelli is inconsistent with the evidence of the prisoner. In his record of interview, the prisoner asserted that everything was in effect quiet, gentle and happy until midnight on 17 February 2000, when he and Mrs Diab went to sleep. He said that when they were both in bed, having been asleep, Mrs Diab went to the toilet, and when she came back she was playing with a knife that he had purchased that afternoon. He claimed that she was saying that “she was joking,” and that he tried to take the knife off her, as a result of which “she hit me on my finger”, i.e., of the left hand. When asked about details of the events which led to Mrs Diab’s death, the prisoner replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “I don’t know what happened. I took the knife and I found her on the floor, she was dead on the floor after two hours. I called my son and asked him to call the police to tell them what happened with me. The police came and they said, ‘What’s happened?’ The knife was still in my hand, and I told him that I, that the woman is dead.” (Answer 144) 
        
       
      
    20 This is to be contrasted with the prisoner’s oral testimony, in which he said that up until about 11pm, when his son Ahmed rang, things were friendly, with nothing being said that would upset the prisoner. However, within a very short time, perhaps seconds, of the phone call from his son, he claimed that the atmosphere changed, together with the behaviour of Mrs Diab. He said she complained about his son ringing when the two of them were together and then launched into a tirade against the prisoner and his family. He attributed to her the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “Son of a slut, your mother is a slut, your mother is a head of a league of sluts, your children are sluts. Tomorrow you going to go to your birthday. Your daughter is a slut and I am going to fuck your daughter because her husband is paralysed … and your daughter needs this.” 
        
       
      
    21 This language is said to have occurred at a time when the prisoner says Mrs Diab was “very upset” and took only 5-10 minutes, during which time the prisoner “was trying to calm (Mrs Diab) down to pacify her”. 
     
      
    22 In his oral testimony, the prisoner adhered to the evidence in his record of interview that Mrs Diab went to the bathroom. He said that she then came back to the room, where the prisoner was on the bed. However the account in his oral testimony then diverges significantly from that in his record of interview. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I was trying to talk to her gently and calmly. She came, she wanted to get on the bed so I would make love to her again. I said to her;  
         
          
          ‘Please sit down, so we can talk together. I am tired now, and I can’t make love. Let us have mutual understanding calmly.’  
          
         
        She got up from the bed, and there was a cucumber on the table. She was using the cucumber on herself  
         
        … 
         
        she was inserting it on herself from the front and back 
         
        … 
         
        she was swearing and saying the same word that she used before. I asked her, ‘please remove the cucumber’. I was begging her, ‘why are you doing this to me?’ She told me, 
         
          
          ‘I am going to hit it in your mum and dad’ 
          
         
        … 
         
          
          ‘I am going to put it in your mother and father and dad and the whole family. Your whole family. And if you are thinking of going back to your wife, you’re not going to go back to your wife unless I am going to kill you and kill myself first. I will kill you and kill myself.”’ 
          
         
        
       
      
    23 He then gave evidence that the cucumber fell on the floor and he got up from the bed in order to pick it up. As he was bending over she then hit him on the shoulder “with the sole of her foot”. At this time, he was trying “to be very, very calm with her”. 
     
      
    24 When asked what happened next, he said in his oral testimony: 
     
      
       
        
        “When I got up from the floor, and I was going back to the bed, she pulled out a knife and charged me. She hit me the first time and the second time and then other times in my hands and she jumped on me on the bed … I thought that my hand had blown away.” 
         
        
       
       
      He then said: 
       
       
        
        “I remember after she charged at me while I was on the bed, I remembered taking the knife and hitting her, and after that I don’t remember anything  
         
        … 
         
        I took the knife and hit her, and after that I don’t remember anything that happened.” 
        
       
      
    25 The testimony given by the prisoner in relation to his being kicked in the left shoulder by the sole of Mrs Diab’s foot is inconsistent with the answer given by him in his record of interview. In it he said that he was on the bed, took the knife off her “and then she fell on me because her knee hit my shoulder, my shoulder is hurting and then I don’t know what happened.” (Answer 212) It is also to be contrasted with further evidence given by the accused when the inconsistency was later pointed out to him when he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am telling you, it was either her knee, or the sole of her foot. I didn’t see her.”  
        
       
      
    26 Furthermore, he did not explain the discrepancy in relation to where he was at the time of the alleged assault by Mrs Diab. In one version, he was standing, leaning over whilst picking up the cucumber; in another, he was lying on the bed.  
     
      
    27 The jury rejected the prisoner’s claim that he acted in self-defence. The jury also rejected the claim by the prisoner to have been provoked into doing what he did.  
     
      
    28 The oral testimony given by the prisoner was inconsistent, both internally and with his record of interview. It was also inconsistent with the evidence of Mrs Mughelli. His record of interview also conflicts to an extent with evidence given by his son. The prisoner did not present well. I did not find his evidence convincing; indeed, to the contrary.  
     
      
    29 His attempt to vilify Mrs Diab by asserting that she used the most filthy language, which was language of a kind likely to be extremely insulting to a Lebanese man, is inconsistent with his record of interview. In it, there is no suggestion of any filthy language by Mrs Diab and when, at the end of the interview, he was asked if he had anything he wanted to add or to tell the police about the matter, he replied in the negative. He did not add anything about any such language, or about any attack on him by her. 
     
      
    30 The record of interview was taken reasonably proximately to the events which led to the trial of the prisoner. He was not forced to take part in the interview at that time. Indeed, he was given an opportunity to defer further questioning. He declined this opportunity. He had the benefit of a qualified interpreter, and so there is no question as to his proper understanding of the questions nor as to the accuracy of translation of his responses. He said nothing in his interview about any attack upon him by Mrs Diab. The picture painted in the record of interview was one of happiness and serenity. There was no suggestion of any altercation between them. The minor cuts which he received were, according to him, occasioned when, in the course of a playful interlude in which Mrs Diab said she was “joking” and “kidding”, he took the knife from her as they were rolling together on the bed.  
     
      
    31 I do not accept the evidence given by the prisoner that Mrs Diab used language of the kind set out above, or any language of a like kind, to him. I have no doubt that this evidence is an afterthought, designed to support a defence of provocation. Likewise, I reject his evidence that Mrs Diab charged him with a knife. It too is an afterthought intended to support his defence of self defence. His evidence that “she pulled out a knife and charged at me” (T 519; italics added) verges on the absurd. Mrs Diab was, on the evidence of the prisoner, naked. From where did she pull out the knife? If she charged him with a knife in her hand, why did he give the version of events which he gave in his record of interview? The answer to these questions is, without doubt, that his evidence in this regard was a fabrication. The jury rejected his defences of self defence and provocation. I reject the detailed testimony which he gave supporting such defences. The minor cuts on his hands were incurred as he wielded the knife and Mrs Diab sought to defend herself. The somewhat more obvious cut on one of his hands was, as the evidence of Dr Franco and Dr Lee shows, self-inflicted. I also reject his claim that he said nothing in the record of interview about filthy language directed at him by Mrs Diab out of some sense of chivalry towards her, that he did not wish to blacken her in any way.  
     
      
    32 The picture which clearly emerges and which I find is one in which there was a dispute between the prisoner and Mrs Diab. I have no doubt that the dispute arose because Mrs Diab told him that she wished to discontinue their association and that he was not prepared to allow this to happen. He was infatuated with her and had been for some time, as is evidenced by his repeated phone calls to her from Melbourne and his journeys to Sydney to see her. I am further satisfied to the relevant standard that when the prisoner was unable to convince Mrs Diab to leave her husband and children and go with him, he killed her, using the knife which he had purchased that afternoon. 33 That the prisoner was infatuated with Mrs Diab is supported by evidence from a number of the sources. For example, although he was in Melbourne he rang her frequently. The evidence of his sister, Mrs Assaad, establishes this. She said that when her brother came to Melbourne he said he was thinking of asking Mrs Diab “if she could go with him to live in Melbourne”. Later, when her attention was drawn to a statement that she had made shortly after the killing, she agreed that the prisoner said “he wanted to marry (Mrs Diab) and bring her to Melbourne”, and that when he spoke to her on the telephone he was “always happy and laughing”. These telephone conversations were undoubtedly frequent and tended to be secretive on the part of the prisoner. He used to take his mobile phone out into the backyard to speak to Mrs Diab. The telephone calls by the prisoner to Mrs Diab continued into 2000. Whilst they may not have been every day, they were frequent. Furthermore, it was common ground that over a period of approximately twelve months preceding Mrs Diab’s death, she and the prisoner went to the Gardenia Motel on an average of two to three times per month, where they occupied the same room – paid for by the prisoner. In addition, an admission was made that the prisoner travelled from Melbourne to Sydney and Sydney to Melbourne on a number of occasions. These would undoubtedly have been to enable his liaison with her, which was then underway, to continue. The prisoner and Mrs Diab also visited the Padstow RSL on no fewer than 30 occasions between 15 July 1999 and 5 December 1999. 34 The prisoner rang Mrs Assaad’s home in the early hours of the morning following the killing. In the course of his telephone conversation he referred to the deceased as “my wife”. Mrs Assaad confirmed that her brother had a very bad temper, used to get very angry and shout a lot. Her evidence shows that he was clearly a person who was capable of anger and behaviour associated with anger. 
     
      
    35 The foregoing matters reinforce the conclusions to which I have come that the prisoner was obsessional about his association with Mrs Diab, and that it is not sensible to accept that it was the prisoner who was proposing to break off the association. 
     
      
    36 I am satisfied that the multiple stab wounds inflicted by the prisoner on Mrs Diab were inflicted in anger and resentment because Mrs Diab would not comply with the prisoner’s wishes.  
     
      
    37 After the killing, the prisoner took beer from the refrigerator in the room and consumed it. He also smoked a number of cigarettes. I have no doubt from the physical evidence found in the room the he also had a sleep, and as the evidence of Mrs Mughelli clearly demonstrates, he had a shower. All this occurred before he had a conversation with his son and even then, he was anxious for the police not to be called until later. 
     
      
    38 He spoke to his son Ahmed Khalouf at around 2.32am. The conversation was in Arabic. He said, “I think I have committed a crime”. When asked what he meant by this, he said; “I think I have killed her.” His son quickly informed the prisoner that the police would have to be informed, and that it would be necessary “to explain to them what happened.” In the course of this conversation, the prisoner seemed calm. His son said that he would ring another relative and then ring his father back. This occurred a short time later. In the course of this conversation, the prisoner asked his son to make sure that the police called the ambulance. In a third call, the son ascertained where his father was and the prisoner asked his son if he could defer calling the police “until the morning” so that he could have a sleep, notwithstanding that he had earlier said that he had “just woke up” and that Mrs Diab had been “laying there … for two hours”. Very correctly, the son rang the police, who subsequently attended at the scene.  
     
      
    39 In the course of his evidence, Ahmed Khalouf confirmed that he had telephoned his father at about 11pm on the night of 17 February 2000 and had a short conversation with him. He had rung his father because he was worried. In the course of the conversation, he asked his father why he didn’t tell him “something was wrong”. His father replied; “There was nothing wrong, I was out with a friend.” Later, the son challenged his father as to why he had not told him that something was wrong when he phoned at 11pm. The prisoner responded, “I was fine, there was nothing.” This answer does not fit with the evidence of Mrs Mugelli. 
     
      
    40 In his evidence, Ahmed Khalouf said that the prisoner had told him in one of the conversations that occurred early in the early hours of 18 February 2000: 
     
      
       
        
        “She hit me with a knife, she attacked me … she hurt me on my hand, my finger.”  
        
       
      
    41 He was cross examined on a statement which he made, and in the course of this cross examination was asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q - In one of those conversations with your father, is it correct to say you asked him: “How did you do it?” 
         
        A – Yes 
         
        Q – And he said; “With a knife.” Is that right? 
         
        A – Yes 
         
        Q – And you said, “Why?” Is that right? 
         
        A – Yes 
         
        Q – And he said, “She hurt me, she cut me, I grabbed the knife off her and I hit her with it.” 
        
       
      
    42 That these versions were given by the prisoner before the record of interview is significant. They are statements made by a father to a son. Their effect is to make the father seem less reprehensible in the eyes of his son. The fact that this version was proffered to a member of the family, but not to the police to whom it had been said by the son that the prisoner should “explain to them (the police) what happened”, strongly supports the conclusion that the version given by the prisoner to the police is closer to the truth, but is not the complete truth. There was no attack by Mrs Diab. Furthermore, there is no allegation by the prisoner to his son in any of the four conversations detailed by him that the prisoner asserted that Mrs Diab had used filthy language to him, or that any language of such a kind on her part provoked him to do what he had done. I have no doubt that no such allegations were made, because no such words were said. Absence of any such allegation in the record of interview also supports this conclusion.  
     
      
    43 The fact that the prisoner had a knife with him when he went to Rydges Hotel on the night in question was the subject of differing explanations.  
     
      
    44 The Crown argued that the knife had been purchased by the prisoner with the intention of using it on Mrs Diab should she persist in refusing to leave her husband and children and go with the prisoner. Against this was the argument raised by counsel for the prisoner that the knife had been purchased by the prisoner at the request of Mrs Diab so that she could use it to defend herself in the event of an attack on her way home from work. 
     
      
    45 The knife had been purchased by the prisoner shortly after 3pm on 17 February 2000. Mrs Diab was not with the prisoner when the purchase was made. It was only after the knife had been purchased that he met Mrs Diab. This meeting occurred at about 5pm. They went shopping, purchased some fruit and vegetables and then went to the RSL Club. They there had some drinks and then repaired to Rydges Hotel. 46 The room had been booked by Mrs Diab, but the name in which the room was booked was changed by the prisoner to his name, and he paid for the room. They went to their hotel room, where the prisoner says they ate a mango and some red grapes and during this time he told her how he was going to return to his home and “was wishing her a happy life with her family, then we got on the bed and we made love.” I do not accept his evidence that he was cordial with Mrs Diab about her future life with her family.  
     
      
    47 In his record of interview, the prisoner said he bought the knife because he was going to give it to her as a present, as Mrs Diab was looking for a knife, because she said she worked at North Sydney and came back home late at night. This conversation is said to have occurred some ten days before the killing. As against this Mrs Diab’s son said that she had never expressed any fears about coming from her places of employment to home, and had never suggested to any of the family that she should carry a knife. A knife is a less than usual weapon for a woman to use. 
     
      
    48 There is nothing to indicate that the knife was used to peel any fruit or vegetables. The cucumber, to which reference has already been made, was uncut. The prisoner said that other cucumbers were eaten, but without being peeled. This in itself is curious in view of the nature of the cucumbers. There was no mango skin or stone found in the room. I am satisfied that the knife was not used as a fruit knife. Furthermore, I do not accept that Mrs Diab requested the prisoner to purchase the knife. These considerations point to the knife having been purchased for the purpose of possible use in the way in which it was ultimately used. As against this is the fact that the knife was purchased by the prisoner using his credit card. Furthermore, as a result of actions on the part of the prisoner, the room in which he killed Mrs Diab had the booking changed to his name. In addition, he did not attempt to flee the scene, although flight would probably have been pointless. In view of these countervailing circumstances, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the knife was purchased for the express purpose asserted by the Crown, although I think it probable that the prisoner purchased the knife intending to use it in the way in which he did, should the need arise. As a consequence the suggestion of premeditation back to a time antecedent to the night of 17 February 2000 must be resolved adversely to the Crown. 
     
      
    49 The killing was quite horrible. The terror experienced by Mrs Diab in the moments before her death must have been extreme. The ferocity of the attack upon her is manifest by the nature and extent of her injuries; multiple wounds, vital organs struck, the spinal column damaged by the force with which it was struck by the knife – a force sufficient to distort the knife. Neither to the police nor in his evidence did the prisoner express remorse. Worse, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he deliberately lied and blackened even further the reputation of Mrs Diab in his endeavours to escape an adverse verdict from the jury. 
     
      
    50 Although the murder was not one which could be described as of the worst category, it was nevertheless a murder which falls into a high category of blameworthiness.  
     
      
    51 The crime was committed as one of anger, vengeance and deprivation. As I have said, I am satisfied to the relevant standard that the prisoner killed Mrs Diab because she had refused to continue with their liaison, and he dealt with her on the basis that if he could not have her, no-one else would. 
     
      
    52 In imposing sentence, it is appropriate that the Court make it clear that not only is murder a most serious crime, but that fatal attacks upon women of the kind and in the circumstances that gave rise to the death of Mrs Diab, will be visited with a heavy penalty. Not only is this important as a punishment for the perpetrator of the particular crime, it is also important for the community at large. 
     
      
    53 In determining what is an appropriate sentence, it is difficult to find an exactly comparable case. However in its submissions on sentence the Crown drew attention to a number of cases. The first was Regina v Ho Jun Heo (Allen J, 21 May 1993, unreported). That involved a male who was 29 years of age at the time of the killing. The killing arose out of a break-up of a relationship with an attractive young woman with whom the prisoner had become infatuated to the extent that he was obsessional. The victim died as a result of three stab wounds. However, the prisoner in that case expressed immediate contrition, offered a plea of guilty to manslaughter and showed his contrition by a genuine attempt at suicide. A minimum term of eleven years was imposed by the judge in that case. As can be seen from the short summary of the facts, it was a quite different case from the present. 54 In Regina v Twala (CCA, 4 November 1994, unreported), the prisoner had relied at the trial on a defence of diminished responsibility. The jury rejected that defence and returned a verdict of guilty of murder. The prisoner was aged just over 30 at the date of the murder. The trial judge imposed a sentence of penal servitude for life. On appeal, it was held that the killing was clearly influenced by the mental disturbance of the prisoner and should not have been characterised as falling within “the worst category”. Nonetheless, whilst quashing the sentence of life imprisonment, the Court imposed a sentence of penal servitude for 20 years, with a minimum term of 15 years. Again that case is different from the present. The criminality involved was mitigated by the mental disturbance of the prisoner. 55 In Regina v Nixon (CCA, 31 October 1995, unreported), the prisoner had been sentenced to penal servitude for 18 years consisting of a minimum term of 13 ½ years and an additional term of 4 ½ years. Although this sentence comprehended a number of other offences, they were relatively trivial in nature and did not involve any increase in the overall sentence imposed. In that case, the prisoner was 35 years old at the date of the killing. His victim was a female of similar age. They had lived together for about three months and then split up. The killing was by strangulation and was followed by a concealment of the killing by the prisoner burying the body of the deceased. Whether she was dead at the time of burial was not clear from the evidence. On appeal, the crime was described as “a horrible crime” and the Court stressed that “the objective gravity of what the prisoner did must not be overlooked.” Although leave to appeal was granted, the appeal against sentence was dismissed. 
     
      
    56 In Regina v Cheung (CCA, 11 December 1995, unreported), the prisoner had pleaded guilty to the murder of his de-facto wife by stabbing her. He was sentenced to a minimum term of imprisonment for 13 ½ years with an additional term of 4 years. The body of the deceased revealed a stab wound to her abdomen and one to her right breast. In addition, her throat had been cut, and a wound, in which a broken portion of knife was found, had been inflicted to the deceased’s right upper arm. The circumstances were that there had been difficulties in the de-facto relationship, and the deceased indicated she wished to sever her contact with the prisoner. He on the other hand, in a suicide note, proclaimed his love for the deceased. A number of matters were raised in support of the claim that the sentence was excessive. The first was the prisoner’s love for the deceased and his reason for killing her. A second was his manifest contrition. A third was described as “the Chinese cultural element”. Another was a genuine suicide attempt which highlighted the prisoner’s contrition. The prisoner’s appeal against sentence was dismissed. In the course of his judgment, Allen J referred to “what might be called a grand passion for (a woman) which completely overwhelms him”. It had been argued that where this was the case, “there is somehow a degree of respectability in giving vent to that grand passion by seeking to control the life of the woman against her will – indeed, even in an extreme case, taking her life if he believes that is what ought to be done.” In rejecting this argument, Allen J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is no respectability in that at all. It is arrogance. I do accept that having such a grand passion, if it can be so called, can diminish, for sentencing, the importance of the element of personal deterrence. But it certainly does not diminish the importance of the element of general deterrence. Indeed, the very misconception that such a grand passion affords a degree of respectability to what otherwise is abhorrent, makes it all the more important that, for the purpose of general deterrence, it be made perfectly clear that such an approach will not be tolerated in this civilised society.” 
        
       
      
    57 Although there are a number of features of Regina v Cheung (supra) which make it less serious than the instant case, the remarks of Allen J in relation to general deterrence are, in my opinion, appropriate to the present case.  
     
      
    58 In Regina v Leonard [1999] NSWSC 510, 28 May 1999, unreported, Sully J imposed a sentence of 16 years with a minimum term of 12 years on a prisoner who had been convicted of murder after a jury had rejected his defence of provocation. The killing arose out of the break-up of a relationship between the prisoner and the deceased following a period of some five months cohabitation. The relationship had been emotionally brittle and was subject to frequent and volatile swings. It was overshadowed by continuous excessive drinking and drug abuse on the part of the deceased, who had previously been a prostitute. The killing was effected by the prisoner shooting the deceased through the forehead at close range. The prisoner then attempted to commit suicide by shooting himself, but succeeded only in wounding himself. He called the police, and co-operated with them in their investigation. From the very moment of the shooting, he expressed remorse, which the trial judge accepted as genuine. Nonetheless, a term of imprisonment of 16 years, with a minimum term of 12 was imposed. As can be seen from the foregoing, the nature and circumstances of the killing in this case were less heinous than in the case presently under consideration. 
     
      
    59 The Crown next referred to Regina v Serratore [20 July 2000, unreported] in which Kirby J imposed a sentence of 20 years with a non parole period of 14 years in respect of a murder which was described as “a brutal and awful crime” in which a young woman of considerable promise was murdered because she had decided to break off her relationship with the prisoner. The deceased had been strangled, and the injuries on her body indicated that she had attempted to fight off her attacker. Her body was found by the roadside, but whether the murder had occurred there or elsewhere is not clear from the report. The prisoner denied any association with the death of the deceased, and showed no contrition. The prisoner was only young, being just over 22 years of age at the time of the killing. In imposing the sentence, Kirby J reaffirmed that imposed by Newman J following a first trial, and found, as had Newman J, that there were special circumstances as a result of which the non parole period was reduced below the statutory norm.  
     
      
    60 Whilst there is a number of features in Regina v Serratore that are redolent of the present case, there are also features which are different. In favour of the prisoner in the present case is that premeditation has not been found, as it was in Regina v Serratore. As against that is the age and consequent maturity of the prisoner in the present case, and the extent of the violence done to the deceased for the purpose of killing her. On balance, in my opinion, the present case is at least as serious as Regina v Serratore. 
     
      
    61 The final case referred to by the Crown was Regina v Sellen (NSWCCA 5 December 1991). That case was concerned with the hardship of imprisonment as a consequence of the medical condition of the prisoner. The Court indicated that proper allowance must be made for any significant physical disabilities which would increase the burden of the sentence of imprisonment imposed on a particular prisoner. The Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “If it is shown that imprisonment will cause particular hardship (either because of a pre-existing physical or mental disability of the prisoner or because of the circumstances in which the prisoner must be kept for protection) this is a circumstance to be taken into account in determining the duration of the imprisonment.” 
        
       
       
      And referred to: 
       
       
        
        “…serious physical disabilities which will render the period of imprisonment more burdensome for the appellant than for the average prisoner. It is our view that the prisoner’s established poor health constitutes special circumstances within s (2) of the  
        Sentencing Act 
         so as to warrant the additional term we propose to impose …” 
        
       
      
    62 The Crown also produced a schedule of sentences imposed in a number of cases. Whilst the schedule included those referred to specifically above, they also included a number of other cases which in my opinion are sufficiently different from the instant case not to be of much assistance. Those specifically referred to appear to me to provide some basis for comparability of sentence. 
     
      
       
      VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENTS 
       
      
    63 Victim impact statements from the widower of the deceased, from her three daughters and from her son were tendered.  
     
      
    64 Mr Elie Diab, the widower of the deceased expressed his grief at the loss of his wife and the loss of the mother of his children. He had known her for 28 years. They had been married for 25 of those years. Together they took decisions about their future and the future of their children. True it is that there were ups and downs in the relationship but as a result of his wife’s death Mr Diab said that he had been left alone with the burden of pain and the problem of raising and supporting the children on his own. Since the loss of his wife he has experienced depression and said “my life is ripped apart”. His depression required daily medication and because of it he needed counselling. 
     
      
    65 Mrs Diab’s eldest daughter Rackel spoke of the immense pain and suffering that she had experienced from the loss of her mother. From her statement it is clear that Mrs Diab was a loving attentive mother who, especially during the turbulent early years of Rackel’s life in Lebanon in the late 1970’s, had been protective, caring and loving. After immigration to Australia the family quickly adopted the Australian way of life. In the house Mrs Diab was described as the peace keeper, mediator and diplomat. Her hard work helped to provide for the family. Ms Diab said that the way in which her mother died “haunts me day in and day out”. As a result of her mother’s death she finds it increasingly difficult to trust people, especially men. Many friendships she has made with members of the opposite sex have suffered as a result. This has led to her having to seek counselling.  
     
      
    66 The son of the deceased, Gilbert Diab, said that in the first period following his mother’s death he experienced a gamut of responses which was both extensive and extreme. His responses included the agony and torment of bereavement, and although these interrupted the normalcy of his life he returned to university and found work. However, his mother’s death caused his enthusiasms and optimism to wane and he felt sad, helpless, confused, depressed and physically fatigued. Arguments at home grew in regularity and intensity, no doubt due to the stress under which all members of the family were placed. Because the anxiety and consequent depression were taking their toll on him both mentally and physically he saw a counsellor and persisted with this for some time. Notwithstanding the counselling he was overcome by a bout of depression and as a consequence prozac was prescribed for him. Because his father was incapacitated, the loss of the income of Mrs Diab from the work which she undertook resulted in her son’s studies and work plans having to be changed so that he could assist in providing for the family. Clearly, his life has been changed by the loss of his mother. Although he has worked hard to minimise the effects of the loss, they are undoubtedly deep-seated and ongoing. 
     
      
    67 Another daughter, Matilda Diab is only young. Her statement is short but heart wrenching. In it she says, “You wouldn’t believe how much I miss my mummy. If I had one wish it would be to see her face again”. The loss by this child of her mother has meant that sometimes she cries herself to sleep, a readily understandable response by a child for a loving mother who has been killed. 
     
      
    68 Mrs Diab’s youngest child, Michelle, also expresses her sense of loss: 
     
      
       
        
        “I lay in bed crying because my mummy is no longer her with us … I will always remember her and pray for her.” 
        
       
      
    69 The sense of loss and sadness, the psychological consequences and other effects on the family flowing from Mrs Diab’s death are understandable. To an extent they mirror the reactions of ordinary members of the community to a death such as occurred in this case. However, because of the intimate connection between the makers of the statements and Mrs Diab the effects, of her death on them are, as is to be expected, much more profound. 
     
      
    70 I have considered the victim impact statements but conformably with authority (Regina v Previtera (1997) A Crim R 76; Bollen v Regina (1998-99) A Crim R 510) have not made use of them either so as to increase the penalty which should otherwise be imposed, as confirmation that the conclusion to which I have come is the appropriate one or at all. 
     
      
      
      PROBATION AND PAROLE SERVICE REPORT 
       
      
    71 A report dated 18 September 2001 from the Probation and Parole Service of the Department of Corrective Services reveals that although the prisoner appears, for a substantial period of his life, to have been a man with good ethical values who taught his children the difference between right and wrong and was respected in the community, he underwent a substantial change. This change is mirrored in the evidence. He lost his business. He sold his interest in his house. He began drinking and gambling and as a consequence wasted what had previously been his substance. 
     
      
    72 Despite the offence of which he has been convicted his family is said to remain supportive of him and his son in particular still respects him. The report reveals that the prisoner has suffered from diabetes for approximately 17 years and from high blood pressure and ulcer problems for approximately 12 years. All of these conditions are managed by daily medication. The history give to the reporting officer is one in which the prisoner undoubtedly puts the most favourable light on his behaviour. For example, he alleges that Mrs Diab deliberately stabbed him before he stabbed her and that it was not his intention to hurt her. I have rejected these claims, as the verdict of the jury must have rejected them. He further seeks to place the blame for the events on Mrs Diab by claiming that it was he who sought to break off the relationship and that as a consequence of her refusal to accept his decision in this regard she attacked him. I have also rejected this claim in the findings of fact made for the purpose of determining the sentence to be imposed on the prisoner. The report continues “the offender did not initially accept full responsibility for his offending behaviour but gradually came to acknowledge his role to some degree” (italics added). I do not accept that even today the prisoner has any genuine sense of contrition and it is my firm view that he does not accept the enormity of the crime that he has committed, or his responsibility for such crime. 
     
      
       
      Arguments advanced on Behalf of the Prisoner 
      
    73 Counsel for the accused stressed that the prisoner, who is now aged 49, suffered from medical conditions that would make imprisonment more onerous for him than for the ordinary prisoner. Whilst it was recognised that there would be no need for any special protection for the prisoner it was argued that the medical conditions from which the prisoner suffered constituted special circumstances. Furthermore, it was said that although the sentence to be imposed could not be short, the age and medical condition of the prisoner should be reflected in the minimum term, ie the non parole period. 
     
      
    74 The medical condition of a particular prisoner may result in imprisonment being more onerous for him than for the ordinary prisoner. Such a situation can amount to special circumstances. However, there was no medical or other evidence called to suggest that treatment for the disorders diagnosed in the prisoner would be unavailable in prison. What treatment is required for his diabetes is unclear. The pre-sentence report reveals that his diabetes and his other medical conditions are managed by daily medication. The nature of that medication is not stated. There is no evidence to suggest that the daily medication which he has been taking for many years will be denied him in prison. However, both diabetes and degenerative heart disorders are progressive in their natures and are therefore likely in the future to require more or different medical attention from that which the prisoner has had over the last 12 to 17 years. In these circumstances I am of opinion that his medical condition combined with his age constitutes special circumstances.  
     
      
    75 The second matter relied upon by counsel for the prisoner was that there should not be a finding that the prisoner intended to kill Mrs Diab. In support of this submission reference was made to Regina v Bell (1985) 2 NSWLR 466 at 485. In addition it was argued that although the jury had rejected the defence of provocation I should be satisfied that there was some provocation which should be taken into account as a mitigating factor. I reject this submission. As I have already indicated I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner killed Mrs Diab, not because he was attacked or because he was provoked by any insulting words or gestures on her part, but because he was not prepared to let any other man have her if he could not have her. The nature and circumstances of the killing are such as to call for a firm message of general deterrence being sent to the community that behaviour of the kind engaged in by the prisoner is unacceptable in our society. 
     
      
    76 The third matter raised in mitigation was that the killing was not premeditated. I have already dealt with the facts underlying this submission. Although I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the killing was premeditated in the sense that preparations were made for it during the course of the afternoon, I am certainly not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that it was not premeditated. Indeed, as I have already determined I think it is probable that it was. In these circumstances premeditation can not be and is not used adversely to the prisoner, but on the other hand lack of premeditation is not to be used in his favour. 
     
      
    77 It was next submitted that by virtue of his age alone, namely 49, imprisonment may be more onerous for the prisoner. Although the age of the prisoner is a matter to which the court is to have regard I do not think that this prisoner can properly be described as elderly. Furthermore, there is no evidence to suggest that imprisonment for a man aged 49 is any more adverse than to a man 10 years younger than that. There is certainly nothing in the evidence to suggest that imprisonment would have a grossly adverse effect on the prisoner or his health. As a consequence, although I have regard to the age of the prisoner, I do not consider it to be a factor which should be used to reduce an otherwise appropriate sentence. 
     
      
    78 Counsel for the prisoner then referred to the various cases to which reference was made by the Crown and to which I have averted above. He submitted that if the Court were to find that the prisoner stabbed Mrs Diab with the intention of killing her then the various cases to which reference has been made would indicate that the killing in the instant case should be treated as less serious a crime than those referred to in such cases. 
     
      
    79 I have already dealt with the cases in some detail. None of them is the same as the present case. In some of them eg. Regina v Nixon, Regina v Cheung the prisoner pleaded guilty. As a consequence a not insignificant discount on the sentence was appropriate. In some, sincere remorse and contrition were expressed; eg. Regina v Ho Jun Heo, Regina v Leonard. In one, Regina v Twala, the fact that the killing was not in the worst category and was influenced by a mental disturbance of the prisoner resulted in a life sentence being reduced to imprisonment for twenty years on appeal.  Nonetheless, it was submitted that the sentence to be imposed upon the prisoner should be less than the sentences imposed on the prisoners in the cases referred to by the Crown. As I have already indicated those cases are not directly applicable but are helpful to indicate that the crime of the prisoner in the instant case is a very serious one, to contrast his lack of contrition with the contrition that was apparent in a number of those other cases and to provide some basis for comparability of sentence.80 An examination of the facts, the decided cases and the other relevant factors adverted to above, indicates that a term of imprisonment of 20 years would be appropriate in the instant case.  
     
      
    81 The final submission made on behalf of the prisoner was that he was unlikely to re-offend and that as a consequence the statutory relationship between the sentence imposed and the non parole period should be altered in favour of the prisoner. 
     
      
    82 As I have already said the murder committed by the prisoner falls within the category of very serious, but not within the worst category of such crimes. Moreover, I am satisfied that it is unlikely that the prisoner will commit a further murder after his release. Furthermore, the prisoner, as part of his rehabilitation, will have an opportunity to undertake courses in anger management and other like courses which should help him to control his actions in the future. Accordingly, I think that there is some substance in this final submission and combined with the medical condition of the prisoner suggests that a departure from the statutory ratio provided between the sentence and the non-parole period would be appropriate. 
     
      
    83 Although not specifically averted to by counsel for the prisoner in his address the prisoner is entitled to have the Court consider his antecedents. He has none that are adverse. However, in a case such as the present that should not in my opinion result in the imposition of lesser penalty. 
     
      
      
      SUMMARY 
       
      
    84 The actions of the prisoner in killing Mrs Diab were very serious. A life has been taken. The prisoner has not demonstrated before the Court any contrition or remorse. Notwithstanding the pre-sentence report, I am satisfied that the prisoner is not remorseful. Although his age combined with his medical condition constitutes special circumstances, the nature of the crime and the circumstances in which it was committed call for a sentence which is substantial, constitutes a significant retribution and makes it clear to others that actions of the kind engaged in by the prisoner are unacceptable in our community and will give rise to heavy penalties if engaged in.  
     
      
    85 In the instant case I am of opinion that the appropriate sentence for the prisoner is imprisonment for 20 years but that in view of the special circumstances the non-parole period should be reduced to 13 1/2 years. The sentence should commence on the date on which the prisoner was taken into custody namely 18 February 2000. 
     
      
      
      SENTENCE 
       
      
    86 Ali Khalouf, you have been found guilty be a jury of your peers of having murdered Rebecca Diab at Bass Hill on or about 18 February 2000. I sentence you to imprisonment for 20 years in respect of that crime, such sentence to commence on 18 February 2000 and to expire on 17 February 2020. 
     
      
    87 In view of the special circumstances that exist in this case I fix the non-parole period to conclude on 17 August 2013. You will become eligible for parole on 18 August 2013.

      On application by the Crown for witness JD to give evidence via audio-video link. 
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: In this matter application has been made on behalf of the Crown to take the evidence of a particular witness by audio-video link pursuant to the provisions of the Evidence (Audio and Audiovisual Links) Act 1998. 
     
      
    2 Evidence has been tendered and argument has taken place as to whether or not the Crown has established a threshold case for the exercise of the powers conferred by that Act. Having heard such argument I have determined that such a threshold case has been made. 
     
      
    3 Counsel for both accused wish, before a final decision is made in respect of the application, to cross-examine the witness whose evidence is sought to be taken by audiovisual link. Since the ground on which that witness seeks to have his evidence so taken is his fear and apprehension arising out of the fact that there is a gang known as Sing Wa (or Wah or War, it being variously spelt in the documents that are before the Court), the Crown has made application to have the cross-examination of the proposed witness on the voir dire taken in a closed court. 
     
      
    4 A basic principle of the common law is that of transparency in relation to dealing with the rights and liabilities of individuals. Courts should ordinarily conduct their business in public. That has many advantages. It is also a practice which is of very longstanding in the common law. To depart from such a situation requires good reason and adequate legal support. 
     
      
    5 The Supreme Court Act 1970 provides that the Court shall have all jurisdiction which may be necessary for the administration of justice in New South Wales (s 23). This of itself would in my opinion be an adequate ground to order that certain matters be dealt with in a closed court should the circumstances so dictate. 
     
      
    6 However, there is in addition, to that provision a more specific provision in the Supreme Court Act namely s 80. That section provides that subject to any Act the business of the Court may be conducted in the absence of the public in a number of nominated circumstances, one of which is where the presence of the public will defeat the ends of justice; a second is where the proceedings are not before a jury and are formal or non-contentious. That last mentioned circumstance seems to me not to be appropriate to the present case because without doubt the matter is contentious. A third is on the hearing of an interlocutory application, but that is subject to the proviso that it does not apply while a witness is giving oral evidence. 
     
      
    7 This means that the Court is thrown back to s 80(b) pursuant to which the Court may exercise its discretion to conduct the matter in the absence of the public where the presence of the public will defeat the ends of justice. 
     
      
    8 In the present case I am mindful of the fact that the application presently before the Court is a matter on the voir dire. No rights will be finally determined by any decision made in respect of the present application. No liabilities will be imposed. The situation is, therefore, quite different from the situation that pertains in relation to the trial of an issue be it a criminal issue or a civil issue. 
     
      
    9 For those reasons I am of the opinion that in a voir dire application such as the present, the disinclination of the common law to deal with matters other than in the presence of the public is not as strong as it is in the case of dealing with the rights and liabilities of individuals either under the civil or criminal law. 
     
      
    10 In the present case concern has been expressed by the witness as to his being possibly identified by other than the accused persons. The fact that this case is, on the evidence before me, one which involves a gang, gives to the case an atmosphere which would not pervade an ordinary case where no such allegation was made or involved. 
     
      
    11 In those circumstances I am of the opinion that the powers conferred both by s 23 and s 80 of the Supreme Court Act are appropriate statutory sources of power to make the order sought by the Crown. 
     
      
    12 Furthermore a superior court of record, as the Supreme Court is, and has always been (s 22 Supreme Court Act 1970), has an inherent jurisdiction to determine its procedure in such a way as to ensure that the interests of justice are best achieved. 
     
      
    13 In my opinion both under the statute and by virtue of the inherent jurisdiction there is a discretion conferred on the Court to order the closing of the Court. The circumstances in this case justify that particularly, as I have said, because the matter is a voir dire matter rather than a trial and, therefore, I order that the cross-examination of the witness take place in a closed court.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
      
     1 IPP AJA: I will ask Grove J to give the first judgment. 
     2 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentence imposed by Shillington DCJ in the Newcastle District Court on 12 December 2000. 
      
       
     3 The applicant had appeared for sentence upon six counts, four of them charging her with being an accessory after the fact to robbery and two counts charging robbery, in each of which the Crown case was that she was a principal in the second degree. 
      
       
     4 The facts of the offences followed a fairly standard pattern. A man called Adam Dudgeon, recently released from prison, came to reside with the applicant, her de facto husband and her children. During this residence it appears that an affair took place between the applicant and the man Dudgeon, and she came to be somewhat influenced by him. 
      
       
     5 A spate of offences occurred, the first on 22 December 1999 and the last on 19 January 2000. The offences followed, as I have said, a general pattern. They were robberies of retail outlets, including chicken stores, bakeries, and pizza parlours, and one attack upon a liquor store. 
      
       
     6 The applicant was involved frequently as the driver of the vehicle which came to the place of the offence. Dudgeon entered the premises to commit the actual offences, often disguising himself with a balaclava. 
      
       
     7 The facts also reveal that on occasions the applicant was actually stopped by police in her vehicle, and gave explanations which were false, but which at the time satisfied police investigators. 
      
       
     8 It can also be remarked that on the occasions of some offences she was accompanied by children, specifically by her ten year old daughter. The applicant received shares of the proceeds, sometimes by way of a distribution of some drugs, which she was at the time using. As I have said, it is not necessary to detail the whole six of the offences. 
      
       
     9 His Honour imposed sentences of fixed terms of twelve months imprisonment on each of the four counts charging that the applicant was an accessory after the fact to robbery. Those sentences have been fully served and are now expired. 
      
       
     10 On the two counts of robbery in which, as I have mentioned, the applicant was alleged to be a principal in the second degree, his Honour imposed imprisonment terms concurrent for four years and six months, with a non-parole period of two years. Those sentences are currently being served, and the applicant’s earliest date of eligibility for release to parole is 3 December 2002. 
      
       
     11 On behalf of the applicant a number of arguments were presented, principally by way of very full written submissions. As I am of the view that one of those grounds is made out, it is appropriate to deal relatively briefly with the others. 
      
       
     12 The applicant complained that the learned sentencing judge did not sufficiently take into account the applicant’s voluntary disclosures of guilt. These disclosures followed a second interview by police. I have already referred to the occasions when she was stopped whilst virtually in flight from the offences, and the same situation pertained to her first formal interview, but shortly thereafter, in a second interview, she did make full disclosure. 
      
       
     13 It is true that his Honour did not make specific reference to the voluntary disclosure of guilt. However, the very objective mildness of the sentences imposed is strongly indicative of the circumstance that his Honour gave full weight and measure to such a matter. 
      
       
     14 It was argued that his Honour did not quantify the discount which he gave for the pleas of guilty by the applicant. Again, that statement, standing alone, is literally accurate. However, as appears from the case of R v Thomson & Ors [2000] 49 NSWLR 383, error is not established simply because a discount is not quantified. Again having regard to the sentences imposed, it is manifest that his Honour gave full and proper weight to such considerations. 
      
       
     15 It was also argued that the applicant harbours a justifiable sense of grievance having regard to sentences imposed upon co-offenders. Dudgeon, who as I have mentioned carried out the actual offences, was effectively sentenced to imprisonment for seven years, with a non-parole period of five and a half years. The comparison that is sought to be made, as I understand the submission, is between that sentence and the sentences imposed upon the applicant. 
      
       
     16 The applicant was not herself without prior record. It is true that the involvement of Dudgeon was much more serious than her involvement. On the other hand, it is a matter of simple arithmetic that his non-parole period is some two and a half times that imposed upon her. I cannot as a matter of assessment perceive that any sense of grievance harboured by her on this basis is justifiable. 
      
       
     17 Mention was made of sentences imposed upon her de facto husband, a man called Douglas. He received imprisonment for three and a half years, with a non-parole period of eighteen months, but it should be pointed out that he was involved in only two of the offences. There were other circumstances which were dealt with by the sentencing judge, who was aware of other sentences which had by this point been imposed, and again I am unable to assess any sense of grievance harboured by the applicant as being justifiable. 
      
       
     18 The final matter which I regard is unsustainable is a complaint that his Honour did not backdate the sentence which he directed to commence from 4 December 2000, that is to say, the date upon which the applicant was placed in custody by his Honour. She had been in custody for some nineteen days after arrest, prior to being granted bail in the Supreme Court. 
      
       
     19 His Honour expressly said that he would take into account that she had been in custody for some nineteen days before she was bailed, and for my part, I see no reason to express any scepticism about his Honour’s expressed statement to that effect. It is true that statements in this Court have encouraged judges to backdate sentences in order to enable there to be clarity about matters being taken into account, but it does not demonstrate error for a judge not to do so. 
      
       
     20 Accordingly, I am of the view that none of those grounds are made out. 
      
       
     21 However, I turn to the final ground, which I have indicated I regard as having been sustained. This relates to the value of assistance to authority which in the event, has been given by the applicant. By consent of the Crown, there has been put before the Court certain information, to which I will later refer, concerning events subsequent to his Honour’s sentence. 
      
       
     22 At the time of sentence the applicant gave evidence. It appears that then, for the first time, and to the apparent surprise of the advocate then representing her, she indicated that she was prepared to give evidence to assist the Crown in any proceedings against her co-offenders. His Honour dealt with the matter in these terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “There has been some indication in your evidence, and this apparently has been the first formal indication, that you are prepared to assist in the forthcoming trials of the principals Dudgeon and your de facto husband Tony Douglas. It seems somewhat problematical as to whether that in fact is really the situation. You have certainly had the opportunity of making formal statements for use by the prosecuting authorities. You say that you had thought about it prior to your absconding and had even discussed the matter in general terms with Ms Zahra, who appears for you today. 
         
        
        
         
         As nothing direct has resulted from those discussions, and although you have yourself said in your evidence that you are prepared to give that kind of assistance, one could understand that ultimately that may not be the position, particularly as one of those involved is the father of your children. Ms Zahra herself has realistically suggested that because of your psychological situation it may not be practical for you to give that assistance. However, there is the possibility that you will do so, and I have taken that matter into account.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     23 Subsequent events have shown that it was not possible for his Honour to fully appreciate the commitment offered by the applicant. In January 2001 the applicant made a full statement to police authorities, which was incriminating of her two co-offenders. 
      
       
     24 More significant than that, in my view, was the circumstance that the co-offender Dudgeon on several occasions wrote from his position in custody to the applicant, and without reciting the entirety of the content of his letters, it suffices to observe that he proposed to the applicant that she should provide him with false evidence in order to enable him to escape justice. Not only did the applicant decline so to do, but she very properly handed over those letters to authorities. 
      
       
     25 I think it is reasonable to conclude that the subsequent pleas of guilty by Dudgeon and by Douglas were very much inspired by the offer of the applicant to give evidence on behalf of the Crown, and by her conduct which I have just described. 
      
       
     26 That ground having been made out, it is appropriate for this Court to consider the matter of sentence and possible re-sentence. I have already observed that in my view the sentences imposed by the learned District Court judge were mild indeed. Nevertheless, there is before the Court information concerning the steps towards rehabilitation which the applicant has taken. I also think it appropriate to take into account the family circumstances, the promises of future rectitude, and the other matters which are set out in lengthy affidavits by both the applicant and her mother. 
      
       
     27 The learned sentencing judge found there were special circumstances justifying the reduction of the non-parole period component of the sentence, and for reasons identical to him, I would reach the same conclusion. 
      
       
     28 There is one further matter to which reference should be made. There is evidence before the Court that whilst in custody the applicant has herself been the subject of some attack. It is reasonable to conclude that that attack may itself have been inspired by information becoming available that she has given assistance to the Crown of the type that I have indicated. 
      
       
     29 The consequence is therefore that it is likely that the applicant’s period in custody will be more onerous than his Honour had expected at the time he was imposing sentence, when the matter of assistance needed to be dealt with as a mere and somewhat faint possibility, as his Honour indicated. In my view the offences were serious, but nevertheless, having regard to the findings that I would make, there should be a reduction in favour of the applicant. 
      
       
     30 I would therefore grant the application for leave to appeal and allow the appeal, and quash the sentences imposed upon counts four and five in the indictment. In lieu thereof, on each count, to be served concurrently, I would sentence the applicant to imprisonment for three years and six months, to date from 4 December 2000, and I would specify a non-parole period of one year and six months to commence upon the date just expressed and to expire on 3 June 2002. The applicant would therefore be eligible for release to parole on 3 June 2002. 
      
       
     31 IPP AJA: I agree. 
      
       
     32 DOWD J: I also agree. 
      
       
     33 IPP AJA: The orders of the Court will accordingly be as proposed by Grove J.

       R. v. G.S. 
        
        
       Judgment 
       
     1 POWELL JA: From 2 January 2001 until 23 January 2001, the Appellant stood trial before McGuire DCJ and a jury of twelve in the District Court Sydney indicted on seven counts alleging offences committed upon his daughter F.S., the counts in the indictment being that he: 
      
       
      1. between 1 January 1974 and 31 December 1974 at Rouse Hill did assault F.S. and at the time of such assault did commit an act of indecency upon F.S., then being under the age of 16 years, namely, the age of 5 or 6 years; 
       
       
      2. between 2 February 1977 and 31 December 1978 at Rouse Hill did assault F.S. and at the time of such assault did commit an act of indecency upon F.S., the said F.S. being under the age of 16 years, namely, between the ages of 9 and 10 years; 
       
       
      3. between 2 February 1980 and 31 December 1980 at Rouse Hill did assault F.S. and at the time of such assault did commit an act of indecency upon F.S., the said F.S. then being under the age of 16 years, namely, of the age of 12 years; 
       
       
      4. between 2 February 1984 and 30 June 1984 at Rouse Hill, then being a father, unlawfully and carnally did know F.S., a girl above the age of 10 years and under the age of 17 years, namely, the age of 16 years, and then being the daughter of him, the said G.S; 
       
       
      5. between 2 February 1984 and 30 December 1984 at Kings Cross did have carnal knowledge of F.S., she being the daughter of G.S.; 
       
       
      6. between 1 January 1986 and 31 December 1986 at Bondi, did have carnal knowledge of F.S., she being the daughter of G.S.; 
       
       
      7. between 1 August 1988 and 31 August 1988 at Sydney did have carnal knowledge of F.S., she being the daughter of G.S. 
       
     2 Each of counts 1 to 3 was based upon the provisions of s.76 of the Crimes Act 1900 as they were between 2 August 1974 and 14 July 1981 prior to their repeal by the Crimes (Sexual Assault) Amendment Act 1981. Count 4 was based upon the provisions of s.73 of the Crimes Act 1900 as they were between 1 October 1924 and 23 March 1986 when they were repealed by the Crimes Act (Child Assault) Amendment Act 1985. Count 5 was based on the provisions of s.78A of the Crimes Act 1900 as they stood between 1 October 1924 and 23 March 1986 when they were repealed by the Crimes (Child Assault) Amendment Act 1985. Count 6 could be supported by the provisions of s.78A of the Crimes Act 1900 as they were prior to their repeal on 23 March 1986 or by the provisions of s.78A of the Crimes Act 1900 as they were following the coming into operation of the provisions of the Crimes (Child Assault) Amendment Act 1985. Count 7 was based upon the provisions of s.78A of the Crimes Act 1900 as they have been since the coming into operation of the provisions of the Crimes (Child Assault) Amendment Act 1985. 
     3 At all times since its insertion into the Act by the Crimes (Amendment) Act 1924, s.78F of the Crimes Act 1900 has provided as follows: 
      
       
       “78F  
       Sanction of Attorney-General 
        
       (1) No prosecution for an offence under sections 78A or 78B shall be commenced without the sanction of the Attorney-General. 
        
       (2) All proceedings under the said sections shall be held in camera.” 
       
     4 The Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986 provides (inter alia) as follows: 
      
       
       “4.  
       Director 
        
       (1) The Governor may appoint a Director of Public Prosecutions. 
        
       (2) The Director shall have and may exercise the functions conferred or imposed on the Director by or under this or any other Act. 
        
       (3) The Director is responsible to the Attorney General for the due exercise of the Director’s functions, but nothing in this sub-section affects or derogates from the authority of the Director in respect of the preparation, institution and conduct of any proceedings. 
        
        ………. 
        
       11.  
       Consents 
        
       (1) The Director may consent to prosecutions for offences, being offences of a kind in relation to which an order under subsection (2) is in force. 
        
       (2) A person who has, under a law of the State, the power to consent to prosecutions for offences of a particular kind may, by order published in the Gazette, authorise the Director to consent to prosecutions for offences of that kind.  
        
        ………. 
        
       (5) If the Director consents to a prosecution for an offence, being an offence of a kind to which an order under subsection (2) is in force, the prosecution may be instituted and conducted without the consent of any other person. 
        
       (6) The Director shall notify the person who gives an authorisation under this section of the giving or refusing of consent under the authorisation. 
        
       (7) If the Director gives or refuses consent under an authorisation under this section, the person who gives the authorisation is bound by the Director’s decision. 
        
       (8) In this section: 
        
       ‘consent’ includes authorisation, sanction and any similar authority.” 
       
     5 Sections 48, 49 of the Interpretation Act 1987 provide (inter alia) as follows: 
      
       
       “48.  
       Exercise of statutory functions 
        
       (1) If an Act or Instrument confers or imposes a function on any person or body, the function may be exercised (or, in the case of a duty, shall be performed) from time to time as occasion requires. 
        
       (2) If an Act or Instrument confers or imposes a function on a particular officer or the holder of a particular office, the function may be exercised (or, in the case of a duty, shall be performed) by the person for the time being occupying of acting in the office concerned. 
        
       49.  
       Delegation of functions 
        
       (1) If an Act or Instrument confers a power on any person or body to delegate a function, the person or body may, in accordance with the Act or instrument, delegate the function to a person or body by name or to a particular officer or the holder of a particular office by reference to the title of the office concerned. 
       
       
       ……… 
       
       
       (5) A delegated function that purports to have been exercised by a delegate shall, until the contrary is proved, be taken to have been duly exercised by the delegate. 
        
       (6) A delegated function that is duly exercised by a delegate shall be taken to have been exercised by the delegator.  
        
        ………. 
        
       (8) If a function is delegated to a particular officer or the holder of a particular office: 
        
       (a) the delegation does not cease to have effect merely because the person who was the particular officer or the holder of the particular office when the function was delegated ceases to be that officer or the holder of that office, and

     6 On 10 July 1987 there was published in the Gazette an Order made by the then Attorney-General, the Hon. T.W. Sheehan, bearing date 1 July 1987 which Order, so far as is relevant, was as follows: 
      
       
       “ 
       DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS ACT 1986 - 
        
        ORDER 
        
       IN pursuance of section 11(2) of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986, I do, by this my Order, authorise the Director of Public Prosecutions to consent to prosecutions for the offences in respect of which my consent is required under the following provisions: 
        
         
          
          Crimes Act 1900 – sections 78F, 78T, 172 and 547A 
          
         
        
       
       
       ………” 
       
     7 On 10 November 1997, the Director of Public Prosecutions, N.R. Cowdery Esq QC executed an Instrument which was in the following terms: 
      
       
       “SANCTION OF THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS 
        
        New South Wales 
         
        Section 78F(1) Crimes Act, 1900 
        
       PURSUANT to an Order published in the Government Gazette on 10 July 1987, by authority of Section 11(2) of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986 I HEREBY SANCTION the commencement of proceedings against (GS) for three offences contrary to Section 78A of the Crimes Act 1900.” 
       
     8 The trial before McGuire DCJ and jury in January 2001 was the second trial of the Appellant, the first trial, based on the same seven counts as in the indictment in January 2001, having lasted for some 4 weeks in March 2000. At that trial the jury were unable to reach agreement in respect of any of the counts in the then indictment. 
     9 Although the matter is not entirely clear, it would seem that either prior to, or at the time of, the presentation of the first indictment, application was made to J.X. Gibson DCJ for an order that proceedings on counts 5 to 7 of the proposed indictment, or of the indictment, be stayed, that application being based upon the submission that the “sanction” of the Director of Public Prosecutions to the commencement of the prosecution of the Appellant upon the charges the subject of those counts was null and void and that any trial on indictment based on such “sanction” was invalid as, in the absence of a validly given “sanction”, the Appellant could not lawfully be convicted of the offences the subject of those counts. That application appears to have been dismissed by J.X. Gibson DCJ on 7 March 2000. 
     10 Application was made to this Court (Sheller JA, James and Dowd JJ) pursuant to the provisions of s.5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 for leave to appeal from the Judgment of J.X. Gibson DCJ of 7 March 2000. Having considered the matter, the Court declined to grant the leave sought. 
     11 At the conclusion of the trial before McGuire DCJ, the jury found the Appellant guilty of the offences charged in counts 1, 3 to 7 inclusive but not guilty of the offence charged in count 2.  
     12 On 16 February 2001, McGuire DCJ imposed the following sentences upon the Appellant: 
      
       
      1. Count 1: a fixed term of 12 months to commence on 23 January 2001 and to expire on 22 January 2002; 
       
       
      2. Count 3: a fixed term of 18 months to commence on 23 January 2002 and to expire on 22 July 2003; 
       
       
      3. Count 4: imprisonment for a term of 7 years to commence on 23 July 2003 and expire on 22 July 2010 with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months to expire on 22 January 2007; 
       
       
      4. Counts 5, 6 and 7: imprisonment for a term of 4 years and 6 months to commence on 23 July 2003 and to expire on 22 January 2008 with a non-parole period of 3 years to expire on 22 July 2006. 
       
       
      McGuire DCJ concluded his remarks on sentence as follows: 
       
       
       “The first two sentences comprise fixed terms which have been imposed having regard to the effect of the succeeding sentences. The sentences imposed on the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh counts are concurrent on each other and cumulative upon the sentences imposed on the first and third counts. 
        
       For certainty I state it to be my intention that the overall sentence will result in a non-parole period of six years and a parole period of three years six months.” 
       
     13 As amended, the grounds of appeal taken by the Appellant are as follows: 
      
       
      1. Pursuant to s.78G (sic) of the Crimes Act 1900, the “sanction” relied upon by the Respondent in prosecuting the Appellant in respect of the s.78A offences (being counts 5 to 7 on the indictment) is null and void and/or otherwise invalid; 
       
       
      2. The Appellant received an unfair trial in that the Trial Judge failed to discharge the jury in respect of prejudicial evidence led by the Crown from Dr. A; 
       
       
      3. The Trial Judge failed to adequately and/or properly direct the jury in relation to the Crown prosecutor’s criticism of (A..S.) the Appellant’s elder son, a Crown witness, by failing to direct the jury that the witness had not been given the opportunity to respond to the assertions made by the Crown; 
       
       
      4. The Trial Judge erred in permitting the Crown to recall (Dr. C.Q), a Crown witness following the Appellant giving evidence in his defence; 
       
       
      5. The Trial Judge erred in permitting the Crown to read onto the record the witness statement of (H.S.) the Appellant’s wife, a Crown witness in respect of whom the Crown was given leave to cross-examine pursuant to s.38(1)(c) of the Evidence Act 1995; 
       
       
      6. The Trial Judge erred by failing to permit the Appellant to lead evidence in his defence; 
       
       
      7. The Trial Judge erred in rejecting a no case submission made at the close of the case for the Crown in relation to count 6 on the indictment; 
       
       
      8. The Trial Judge erred in his directions to the jury by: 
       
       
        
        (a) by failing to adequately and/or properly direct the jury in that, in directing the jury to look at each count on the indictment separately, he failed to direct the jury that they were entitled to take into account any reasonable doubt in respect of one count when considering the other counts; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) by failing to warn the jury that, in the circumstances of this case, should they have a reasonable doubt with respect to the Complainant’s evidence on any count, such ought to be taken into account on the Complainant’s credibility and truthfulness generally; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) by failing to direct the jury that they could not use evidence of complaint as evidence of the truth of what was being asserted; 
        
       
       
        
        (d) by commenting in an impermissible manner in relation to the nature of the charges preferred against the Appellant; 
        
       
       
        
        (e) by failing to direct the jury as to the potential unreliability of the evidence of (Dr. S.), a Crown witness; 
        
       
       
      9. The verdicts are inconsistent; 
       
       
      10. The verdicts cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence; 
       
       
      11. Generally there has been a miscarriage of justice. 
       
     14 The Written Submissions which were filed on behalf of the Appellant contain a short summary of the Crown case at trial, which summary was as follows: 
      
       
       “The Crown case at trial alleged that the Appellant had an incestuous relationship with his natural daughter (F.S.) which was commenced in 1974 and lasted some 14 years. It was alleged by the Crown at trial that the relationship commenced by way of indecent acts towards (F.S.) in the nature of masturbation and oral sex and that full penile penetration commenced some time during 1984 and lasted for four years, being counts four to seven on the indictment.  
        
       The evidence in support of the Crown case consisted of 
        
       (a) the complainant’s evidence; 
        
       (b) admissions by the Appellant of a general nature, but none which went specifically to a particular charge; 
        
       (c) cards and letters written by the Appellant which he gave to the complainant (his daughter); and 
        
       (d) observations made by the Appellant’s brother and that brother’s wife of what was considered to be inappropriate behaviour between the father and daughter. 
        
       The complainant’s evidence was that during the fourteen year period she had sexual contact with the Appellant, consisting of him rubbing his penis against her, graduating to oral sex, masturbation and then to full penile sexual intercourse. In relation to this sexual contact, it was the case for the Crown that the seven counts on the indictment were selected instances of a more comprehensive pattern of behaviour of the Appellant with such evidence being led by the Crown as contextual or background evidence by the Crown.” 
       
     15 However, while that summary provides a convenient general statement as to the nature of the Crown case, it is necessary, if one is fully to understand the case made by the Crown and the grounds of appeal taken on behalf of the Appellant, that a more detailed summary of the evidence tendered at trial be given. 
     16 The Complainant F.S. is the natural daughter and eldest child of the marriage of the Appellant and his wife H.S. whom the Appellant, then a United States citizen, had met while serving with the United States Armed Forces in Korea in about 1966 or thereabouts. The Complainant was born in Korea in February 1968. The Appellant, his wife and the Complainant appear to have come to Australia in about 1970 when the Complainant was 2 years of age. The elder of the Complainant’s brothers, A.S., was born in July 1972, the younger of the Complainant’s brothers, D.S., was born in August 1976 and the Complainant’s younger sister, T.S., was born in February 1983. 
     17 Although, after they arrived in Australia the Appellant, his wife and the Complainant – and, after his birth, A.S. – lived for a time at Paddington and, later, Randwick, in about December 1973 they moved to Rouse Hill, following which the Complainant commenced to attend Annangrove Public School.  
     18 The case which the Crown sought to advance in respect of the several counts in the indictment was as I set out below.  
     19 Count 1: The first time something of a sexual nature appeared between the Complainant and the Appellant was soon after Complainant started at Annangrove in 1974. On that occasion the Appellant came to the Complainant’s bedroom while she was in bed. The Complainant shared that bedroom with her brother, A.S. The Appellant lifted the Complainant’s nightie and swung her legs around and took off her underpants. He then separated her legs and rubbed his penis against her vagina. This went on for a while and then he ejaculated onto her stomach.  
      
       
      After the first occasion, the Complainant’s mother, H.S., was giving the Complainant a bath. H.S. said the Complainant’s vaginal area looked red and asked her whether she had touched herself there, to which the Complainant replied “ 
      No, but Daddy has 
      ”. H.S. confronted the Appellant who denied touching the Complainant. 
       
       
      Instances similar to the first one happened again on several occasions through the first part of that year. Sometimes the Appellant would also rub his fingers on the outside of the Complainant’s vagina.  
       
     20 Count 2: Things started to change when the Complainant was in fifth class. One Sunday morning the Complainant and the Appellant were alone in the house. The Appellant had just taken a shower and was wearing only a towel. They had a conversation about sperm. They then went into a bedroom and the Appellant lay on the bed and asked the Complainant to lie next to him. He unwrapped the towel. His penis was erect and he started to rub his hand up and down it. He asked the Complainant if she could do the same, and she put her hand on his penis and rubbed it up and down. He put his hand over hers and rubbed it a bit faster and then ejaculated. The Appellant told the Complainant that that was what sperm looked like, that she was a very good girl and this was their special secret and not to tell her mother. 
      
       
      The Appellant and the Complainant had a very close relationship at this stage. There was an emotional bonding, which, if resisted by the Complainant, would result in the Appellant using “emotional blackmail”.  
       
       
      After the above incident, the Appellant started rubbing his penis against the Complainant’s vagina during the day if the two of them were alone. He would also ask her to masturbate him which she did.  
       
     21 Count 3: One day when the Complainant was in first form the Appellant came into her bedroom and sat down on her bed with an erect penis. He told her to take her clothes off and she did. He asked her kneel between his legs and suck his penis which she did. They heard a door open and HS called out. The Appellant put his pants back on and the Complainant ran into a built-in cupboard and put on her school uniform telling her mother “I’m just showing Daddy my new uniform”. She said this because the Appellant had told her that if her mother knew what was happening, her mother would be sent to a mad hospital.  
      
       
      In late 1993-early 1994, the Complainant and the Appellant went to America. In New York they visited the Appellant’s brother SS and his family. They also visited the family in late 1985 and late 1987. It was in an hotel in New York on this first trip that the Appellant first had sexual intercourse with the Complainant. Sexual intercourse went on almost daily when they were on overseas trips, or when the opportunity presented itself when they were at home at Rouse Hill. 
       
     22 Count 4: Shortly after returning from the first trip to the United States the Complainant and the Appellant were alone in the house at Rouse Hill. The Appellant came into the Complainant’s bedroom, massaged her shoulders and asked her if she would like to do it in his bedroom or hers. He then undressed the Complainant and himself. They engaged in oral sex and sexual intercourse. They used a condom. 
      
       
      The Complainant had been studying music since aged 5 or 6 years. She played viola with the Sydney Youth Chamber Orchestra. The Appellant oversaw her practice, took her to lessons, and generally encouraged her.  
       
     23 Count 5: On the occasion of the Complainant’s first rehearsal with the orchestra the Appellant picked her up from school and told her he had a surprise for her. They drove to the Hyatt Hotel in Kings Cross. She stayed in the car while he registered and got the keys to their room. In the room they engaged in oral sex and sexual intercourse with a condom. He told her how extremely lucky they were to have this sort of relationship. He then drove her to her rehearsal.  
      
       
      Approximately once a week after that in 1984 the Appellant would take the Complainant to the Hyatt before rehearsals and have sexual intercourse with her. However this changed when her rehearsal times changed. However, the Appellant would go to different towns for work e.g. Richmond or Cootamundra and take the Complainant with him. 
       
     24 Count 6: Around 1986 when the Complainant was in her first year of university, the family bought a flat in Bondi. The Complainant and the Appellant were alone there one day, and engaged in oral sex and digital penetration.  
      
       
      Similar things would occur at the Bondi premises several times a week.  
       
       
      About this time the Complainant began to feel that the relationship was not something she could hide as easily as before, but the Appellant told her she was just as guilty as he was, and there was nothing to worry about because it was a loving relationship. After beginning university the Complainant began to resist the Appellant more and “tried to put things off”.  
       
     25 Count 7: In her third year of university, in 1988, the Complainant commenced her first serious relationship with JA. She was finding it more difficult to keep up the relationship with the Appellant, as well as having a sexual relationship with JA. On the last occasion they had sexual intercourse the Appellant had taken the Complainant to an hotel in Coogee called The Esron. He was licking the Complainant’s vaginal area and then tried to get on top of her. She resisted and became angry. She then submitted to sexual intercourse but became distressed and began crying. The Appellant told her that he had gone to a lot of trouble and expense to bring her there and he expected her to be in a more reasonable condition when he got back. He then went for a walk. When he returned they went home.  
     26 After the Complainant had given the evidence to which I have referred above, there were then tendered Exhibits B-N which exhibits were tendered in order to show what was the relationship between the Appellant and the Complainant. These exhibits were notes and cards that were written by the Appellant to the Complainant with what were said to be inappropriate comments on them implying a sexual relationship. Later, during the course of the Appellant’s cross-examination, the Appellant was cross-examined as to the terms of an affidavit, prepared by him, and sworn by him in September 1996 in relation to certain civil proceedings in which the Appellant stated that “From about 1982 we would jokingly refer to our closeness as being lovers and our sexual relationship”.  
     27 It was during the period when those exhibits were being tendered that McGuire DCJ gave to the jury a direction which had been agreed to by both the Crown Prosecutor and the Appellant’s counsel as appropriate at that stage with regard to relationship. That direction was as follows (T. 54): 
      
       
       “Ladies and Gentlemen, as you are aware from what you have seen in that indictment there are seven charges brought against the accused. It is the obligation on the Crown, if it is to prove those charges, to prove them on the evidence to a standard of beyond reasonable doubt.  
        
       You have heard evidence from the complainant that there were many other acts of sexual contact involving rubbing the penis on the vagina, oral sex, masturbation, full penile penetration and so on. The accused is not charged with that conduct. You may be wondering why you are hearing that evidence and what you are to do with it. That evidence of the conduct which has not been charged is relevant in order to place the evidence of the actual offences charged into a true and realistic context, in order to assist you to appreciate the full significance of what otherwise appears to be an isolated act occurring without any apparent reason. It can be used for that purpose and no other purpose. You are not entitled to substitute the evidence concerning the acts not charged for those the subject of the charges. You can not use the evidence of the acts not charged as establishing any propensity on the part of the accused to commit offences of the type charged. 
        
       In the course of my summing-up, I will give you a fuller direction with regard to that aspect of the case but I give you that direction in the meantime in order that you may appreciate just how you are not to treat the evidence. You can not treat it as establishing a likelihood of committing the acts charged. You can only use it in the way in which I have outlined it to you.” 
       
     28 The second witness called in the Crown case was HS, who, on 15 February 1990, at Paddington Police Station, had been interviewed by, and given a statement to, Constable N. I. McGrath, who was then attached to the Child Mistreatment Unit, in the course of which statement she corroborated the Complainant’s version of some of the events especially those regarding counts 1 and 3.  
     29 Despite what was contained in that statement, HS, in the course of her oral evidence gave a different version of what had occurred at the times referred to in counts 1 and 3, a fact which led to the Crown Prosecutor applying for leave pursuant to the provisions of s.38 of the Evidence Act 1995 to cross-examine her in relation to the statement which she had made in 1990, which leave was granted by McGuire DCJ. During the course of that cross-examination, HS said that what was contained in the statement was only what she had been told by the Complainant in 1990, before which she had no suspicions, and that the Complainant’s account of the events the subject of counts 1 and 3 had never occurred. 
     30 At the conclusion of HS’s evidence, the Crown Prosecutor sought to tender HS’s statement, to which tender the Appellant’s counsel objected. In the course of developing his objection, counsel said (inter alia) (T.313): 
      
       
       “Now it is anticipated from what the jury said earlier they will probably have a transcript anyway if they ask for it, subject to your Honour’s view of course. One has to, with respect, draw the line and it should be drawn against tendering a statement such as this because it is not normally done. I’m not saying it can’t be done. But it is not normally done and particularly in the circumstances where the witness has been taken through the statement.  
        
       And it is no advantage to the Crown to have the jury have the statement in their possession. They have heard the evidence, they have been obviously paying very close attention to the evidence and they will probably have access to the transcript in any event. And even the officer, if necessary, could read the statement onto the record. So your Honour one particularity (sic) in a case like this, where this sort of emphasis could alert the jury to the fact that this is what the girl had said, this is the written word, when in fact the only purpose of the statement going in is reflective upon the credibility of a witness for the prosecution, and not the complainant. So it strengthens the complainant’s evidence in written form when the purpose of the cross-examination was to attack the credibility of (HS).” 
       
      At the time, McGuire DCJ deferred ruling on the application until he had had an opportunity to review the transcript of HS’s evidence. 
       
     31 The transcript for the following day records (inter alia) the following (T. 412): 
      
       
       “CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, perhaps as a compromise I would be prepared to adopt Mr. Bellanto’s suggestion that rather than the written statement to go before the jury that the police lady who took the statement read it onto the record.  
        
       HIS HONOUR: Yes. 
        
       HIS HONOUR: I have never previously admitted a statement to police over an objection. I was tempted in this case to depart from the practice, having regard to what I consider to be the deliberate obfuscation and frustration in the cross-examination which might have made it virtually impossible for the jury to understand or retain what was being put to the witness, being necessary to keep coming back to the question after numerous interruptions in one form or another. There is a risk that undue emphasis would be placed on the statement if it goes before the jury in written form. That is to say, that the statement is tendered, and in those circumstances, with some misgivings, I reject the tender on the basis that the police officer reads the statement on to the record so that it will appear in some intelligible form. I take it that you have no objection to that course which you suggested yesterday? 
        
       BELLANTO: Dragging and kicking your Honour but, no.” 
       
     32 On the following day, the former constable who had taken HS’s statement and, as well, a statement by AS was called to give evidence, in the course of which (T.417-420) she read HS’s statement onto the transcript.  
     33 After HS had concluded her evidence and before the former constable was called to give her evidence, there were called the Appellant’s brother SS, the Appellant’s sister-in-law, Mrs. SS, and Dr. A, the father of JA, who, as I have earlier recorded, for a time had kept company with the Complainant. 
     34 SS, who is a physician and a qualified psychiatrist and who lives with his wife and family in New Jersey in the United States, gave evidence as to the relationship between the Appellant and the Complainant which he had observed over a period of years. In 1982, by which time the Complainant was 14 years of age, SS, while on a family visit to Australia noticed that the Appellant and the Complainant were very physically affectionate with each other, the Appellant frequently embracing the Complainant, and the two of them kissing and cuddling a great deal. In 1984, when the Appellant and the Complainant visited SS and his family in the United States, SS noticed there was even more physical closeness between them than before with kissing and cuddling and the Appellant treating the Complainant “as one treats a lover”. Although SS and his family expected the Appellant to say with them in their home, the Appellant said that he and the Complainant preferred to say in Manhatten at an hotel. SS also noticed that the Appellant and the Complainant dressed in almost identical clothing. In 1986, when the Appellant and the Complainant again visited SS and his family, SS observed the same sort of behaviour as before. Although SS asked the Appellant and the Complainant to stay with him and his family, the Appellant again said that he preferred to stay in New York at an hotel. In 1988, when the Appellant and the Complainant again visited SS and his family, SS noticed that the relationship appeared to have changed to some degree, the Complainant appearing restive and giving him the impression that she would have preferred to have remained at home. While the Appellant continued to “paw” her, to touch her, to pull her, to embrace her, the Complainant was more resistant. Later in 1988, following the death of SS’s, and the Appellant’s, mother, SS and his family visited the Appellant and his family in Australia. At that time SS noticed that there appeared to be a heightened tension between the Complainant and the Appellant. Prior to 30 January 1990, SS had had a series of telephone conversations with HS and the Complainant who had remained in Australia while the Appellant had taken AS and DS on a trip to Europe before returning to stay with SS and his family. On 30 January 1990 SS spoke with the Appellant in the presence of his (SS’s) wife and confronted him with the allegations which he (SS) said had been made to him by HS and the Complainant that the Appellant had been sexually molesting the Complainant from the age of 6 or 8 until the age of 20. In the course of a lengthy conversation which extended over many hours, the Appellant made such statements as “Well, what of it?”, “Well, what business is it of yours?”, “I never hurt her, I never forced her to do anything that she didn’t want to do.”, “Everything that we did together was to both our self interests.” and “Look, just because you psychiatrists have some idea that it is bad, I don’t believe it, I don’t believe that loving your daughter is bad and I don’t buy it, that is I don’t buy what you psychiatrists have to say about it.” Later SS and his wife spoke to AS and DS and told them of the allegations which were said to have been made by HS and the Complainant.  
     35 Mrs. SS gave evidence in similar terms to that of SS as to her observations over the years as to the physical relationship between the Appellant and the Complainant. Mrs. SS also gave evidence that, prior to the Appellant and his sons returning to New York, she had received a telephone call from HS in which HS told her about the sexual relationship that the Appellant had had with the Complainant from the time she was a little girl up until the time she was almost 20. At one stage in the course of his evidence in chief, Mrs. SS gave the following evidence (T.383-384): 
      
       
       “A. … 
        
       At one point in the conversation I asked (the Appellant) about why (the Complainant) no longer was in the home anymore? He had told me that he was angry with her and she had been asked to leave. And I asked him what happened? You know, that she essentially had been kicked out of the house. And he told me, in effect, was that she had a boyfriend. 
       
       
       ……… 
       
       
       CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. Tell us what was said? A. Okay. And what (the Appellant) said was: ‘I was angry at (the Complainant) because she had her boyfriend, (JA), and she no longer wants to sleep with me. She no longer wants to have a sexual relationship with me.’ And (the Appellant) told me that he said to her ‘I have had a sexual relationship with you and your mother all these years. Why can’t you have a sexual relationship with both me and your boyfriend (JA)?’ (The Appellant) told me that (the Complainant) refused and that’s why he asked her to leave the home. When I said to (the Appellant) that I thought what he had done was hurtful to (the Complainant) he told me that he felt that he hadn’t done anything that she hadn’t agreed to; that everything that he had asked her to do, she had consented to. I said to (the Appellant) that – ‘There is no way a child of six or eight or ten or twelve or any age child has the free will to consent to anything like that.’ (The Appellant) said to me that he felt that what he did was in her best interests. He loved her in the way that he thought was in her best interests and that my notion of what was in a child’s best interests is based on some conventional do-gooder notion of what was in the child’s best interests that just wasn’t accurate, and that I was wrong. (The Appellant) also told me that he didn’t have full sexual intercourse with (the Complainant) until she was of age and that again therefore he hadn’t done anything that she didn’t agree to. He hadn’t done anything wrong.” 
       
     36 Dr. A gave evidence of a conversation which he said he had had with the Appellant at St. Vincent’s Hospital where HS was then convalescing. He said (T.398): 
      
       
       “… I said that I was aware of his relationship with (the Complainant) and I was distressed firstly about what was happening or what was happening to her emotionally and I mentioned my fears about the younger child, the little girl. That was my conversation …” 
       
       
      At that point, McGuire DCJ stopped Dr. A and the jury was sent outside. Following some discussion, the Appellant’s counsel informed his Honour that he was instructed to ask for a discharge. After further discussion, the transcript records (T. 401-403): 
       
       
       “HIS HONOUR: However, he said it Mr. Bellanto and I agree that causes a problem. If you are seeking a discharge on that basis the short answer is no. There has been a four week trial last year, this matter is already of some antiquity. You’re aware that two witnesses have come out from America and they are going back today. I don’t propose to discharge the jury.  
        
       BELLANTO: Your Honour, the next problem how do we deal with it. To tell the jury they should ignore it really doesn’t go far. We ask your Honour to tell the jury that they may have picked up something which refers to the younger daughter but is reference to other proceedings but the consequence or result of that there is no finding that (the Appellant) has done anything of a sexual nature towards the younger daughter and is clearly at home something along those lines your Honour. 
        
        ……… 
        
       HIS HONOUR: I propose to tell the jury something along these lines: If anybody wants to suggest some additional deletion or variation, let me know. 
        
         
          
          ‘You may have heard reference to the accused’s younger daughter and reference to proceedings and infer that they related to the younger daughter, (TS). 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Ladies and gentlemen, let me make it crystal clear, there is no evidence or, indeed, any allegation of any propriety (sic) or misconduct with regard to (TS), the younger daughter. Indeed she still lives with the accused.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          As a matter of law I give you this direction: You must genuinely put aside any reference to (TS) or any speculation that may have been raised in your minds. If you do not, you would be untrue to your oaths and affirmations.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The oaths and affirmations you took involved your solemn undertaking to determine the question of guilt or otherwise of the accused on the evidence admitted before you. If you do not do so you would acting (sic) unfairly as well being (sic) in breach of your oath or your affirmation.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
       BELLANTO: I am happy with that your Honour.” 
       
     37 When the jury returned, McGuire DCJ then gave a direction in virtually identical terms with those which he had read to counsel (T.406). 
     38 Dr. A’s wife gave evidence of a conversation which she had had with HS. That evidence was as follows (T. 431-432): 
      
       
       “Q. And what was the conversation? A. (HS) brought up the fact that she knew that (the Complainant) had told me that her father had been having sexual relations with her. I asked her whether she had known about this, and she said she suspected it for some time, and then one day when (the Complainant) was around 17, she saw her father emerge, that’s her husband, emerge from (the Complainant’s) bedroom naked. And then she said that she knew what she had suspected was true. 
        
        ……… 
        
       Q. And did (HS) say anything in that conversation about how she felt about what had occurred between her husband and daughter? A. She did. 
        
       Q. What did she say? A. She sounded resentful of (the Complainant), she blamed (the Complainant). She said (the Complainant) had been trying to get her father or (HS’s) husband away from her.” 
       
     39 AS, who, as I have earlier recorded, had given a statement to the police in February 1990 gave evidence as to his questioning the Appellant concerning the allegations that had been made during the course of the confrontation with the Appellant when they were at SS’s home earlier that year. In the course of that evidence AS said that the Appellant flatly denied the allegations. On two occasions the Crown Prosecutor sought leave pursuant to s.38 of the Evidence Act 1995 to cross-examine AS because of what were said to be inconsistencies between his oral evidence and certain parts of the written statement which had given to the police but those applications were rejected, although McGuire DCJ did indicate (T. 458-459) that, depending on the evidence which AS gave in the course of cross-examination, the application might be renewed. 
     40 Despite the suggested inconsistency between his oral evidence and the statement which he had given, AS appears to have adhered to other parts of the statement, as, for example, that, at one stage in the course of his being questioned by AS, the Appellant said that he loved the Complainant and she offered him something that HS could not, and that she had all these new and exciting ideas which the Appellant could discuss with the Complainant which he could not discuss with HS (T.455-456) and that in the course of his statement he had said that the relationship between the Appellant and the Complainant was like that of a married couple (T.457), although in the course of cross-examination (T.464), AS said that he did not mean by that expression to convey anything sexual.  
     41 Dr. CQ, a psychiatrist, gave evidence of having been consulted by the S family in 1991 on which occasion all members of the family were present. During the course of her evidence in chief, Dr. CQ gave the following evidence (T.476-477): 
      
       
       “Q. Did (the Complainant) speak of the sexual contact that she had with her father over the years at that visit? A. Yes. 
        
       Q. And talk in some detail about it? A. Not a lot of actual detail of the sexual activity, but talking about the fact that there had been a sexual relationship between herself and her father since she had been very young.  
        
       Q. And what, emotionally, was she like when she was speaking? A. She and her mother were very agitated. (The Complainant) was – it was a crises (sic) situation so there was a lot of distress. But mostly the mother and the older daughter were very distressed. 
        
       Q. Did the father say anything? A. He didn’t say a lot. He was not particularly distressed.  
        
       Q. Do you remember anything he said at all? A. I remember very clearly his attitude seemed to be one of as if he wasn’t sure why there was such fuss being made. Also that he made no attempt at all to deny anything. 
        
        ……… 
        
       Q. Do you remember anything he said specifically? A. Well the one thing I remember specifically was his statement to (the Complainant), ‘But you were my mistress’, which was something that is fairly unforgettable, so.  
        
       Q. Was that directed at her? A. I can’t remember all of the preceding conversation but it was something about which (the Complainant) very distressed (sic) and weeping and saying to her father words to the effect of, ‘How could you have done – or look what you have done to me, something like that’. I can’t remember the precise words but I do remember clearly his response. He was looking at her and said ‘But you were my mistress’.” 
       
      Although Dr. CQ was cross-examined briefly to suggest that what the Appellant had said was “ 
      What do you think she was, my mistress 
      ?” – a suggestion which Dr. CQ rejected – it was not suggested to her that she had “badgered” the Appellant during the course of the interview.  
       
     42 In the course of his evidence in chief, the Appellant gave the following (inter alia) evidence concerning the occasion of which Dr. CQ had given evidence (T.592): 
      
       
       “Q. Then, was a point reached when you said in response to what said (sic)? A. At a much later stage in this discussion, yes. 
        
       Q. What was the topic of the discussion? A. (The Complainant) was speaking first and raising the same sort of allegations (that) SS had raised to me but of course not in that graphic language. It went along these lines that ‘You did this and you did this and you did this’. That sort of thing. At some stage (Dr. CQ) took over (the Complainant’s) cause and kept the same, badgering me, but on the same lines. ‘Why did you do it to her’. 
        
        ……… 
        
       Q. (Dr. CQ) said something? A. Yes. 
        
       Q. Was a point reached when you said something? A. Yes. 
        
       Q. What did you say? A. I said without the leading up to, what I said is ‘what the hell do you think, she’s my mistress?’ 
        
       Q. When you said that, what were you intending to convey? A. I was intending to confront the allegations that (Dr. CQ) was making to me.” 
       
     43 After that evidence had been given, the Crown Prosecutor submitted to McGuire DCJ that if the Appellant wished to persist in the suggestion that Dr. CQ had “badgered” the Appellant, she should be recalled to answer what was being raised, a submission that was opposed at that stage (T.593) by the Appellant’s counsel. However, the transcript (T.599) records the following at the end of the discussion: 
      
       
       “HIS HONOUR: Short of recalling (Dr. CQ), what do you say, Mr. Bellanto or Crown, if I was to adopt this course; and tell the jury that what the accused said about (Dr. CQ’s) badgering him and him responding to (Dr. CQ), they should disregard, that having never been put to (Dr. CQ) and indeed I was entirely at odds what with what (sic) (Dr. CQ) said, and what the doctor said at page 477. 
        
       BELLANTO: Your Honour I think she should be recalled that is if the Crown wishes to have her recalled. 
        
       CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, I do.” 
       
     44 The transcript (T.710) records the following evidence given by Dr. CQ in chief when she was recalled: 
      
       
       “CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. (Dr. CQ), you gave evidence the other day on the 15th (sic) January this year in relation to the first meeting you had with the (S) family at a family therapy session. And you gave evidence that at one state (sic) during session (sic) (the Complainant) was very distressed and weeping and said to her father words to the effect of, ‘How could you have done these things?’ or ‘Look at what you have done to me’ and it was in response to that you said that he gave the clear response to her, looking at her, ‘But you were my mistress’. Is that right? A. Yes. 
        
       Q. Do you agree with that as being your evidence? A. Yes. 
        
       Q. What do you say to any that, that was in fact a response to what you said to him? A. No, that is not what it was. 
        
       Q. And/or that was a response to you taking over her cause and badgering him along the lines of, ‘Why did you do it to her?’ A. No, no, that is not how I would conduct a session like that.” 
       
      Although Dr. CQ was again cross-examined with a view to her conceding that what the Appellant had said was “What the hell do you think she was, my mistress?” it was not suggested to her during that cross-examination that she had “badgered” the Appellant during the course of the interview. 
       
     45 Dr. S, a psychiatrist who had been the Complainant’s treating psychiatrist from 1989, was called to give evidence, in the course of which he gave evidence of an interview with SS, his wife and, in all probability, the Complainant, in July 1996, in the course of which SS told him certain things concerning the Appellant and the family background. Dr. S had a note to the effect that, in 1990, SS had confronted the Appellant which note was followed by the word “denial”. Although he had earlier thought that the note meant that the Appellant denied the behaviour of which he was accused, he later came to believe that the word “denial” was a reflection of the Appellant’s ability to rationalise his behaviour. 
     46 JP, a close school friend of the Complainant, gave evidence of a close physical relationship between the Appellant and the Complainant. 
     47 Ms. MH, a solicitor, first gave evidence of having been retained in January 1990 by the Complainant who, at that time, was accompanied by HS. Having done so, she then gave the following evidence in chief (T.500): 
      
       
       “CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. In early 1990 did you meet (the Appellant)? A. Yes I did. 
        
       Q. Was that after the visits, the two visits of (the Complainant) and her mother? A. That’s correct. 
        
       Q. Did he come to your office? A. Yes. 
        
       Q. Do you know how long after (the Complainant) and her mother visited, (the Appellant) came to your office? A. It was within about two weeks of our second meeting. 
        
       Q. Please tell the circumstances under which you met him; where did it happened (sic), first of all? A. My office wasn’t located in the main office. It was at 170 Riley Street. I had a separate office, on the corner of Oxford Street and Riley Street and (the Appellant) just arrived in my office one day. The door of the office was always opened, except when I had clients, and he just appeared in my office one day.  
        
       Q. Did he come in with anyone, that you saw? A. No, he was completely alone. 
        
       Q. What did he say, to you? A. He said to me, words to the following effect: ‘I’m (the Complainant’s) father. I know she has been to see you about me sexually molesting her. I did sexually molest her’. 
        
       HIS HONOUR: What did he say? A. ‘I did sexually molest her’, words to that effect. I can’t remember whether it was assault, molest, abuse. It was words to that effect? ‘I’m sorry, I’m sick’ and he then burst out crying and he said, ‘I need help’. 
        
       CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. What did you say to him? A. I said to him, ‘Well I can’t do anything for you. All I can do is tell (the Complainant) that you have been to see me and tell her what you said.’ Words to that effect. 
        
       Q. Why couldn’t you do anything for him at that point? A. Well, he wasn’t my client.” 
       
      In the course of her cross-examination Ms. MH denied that she had “invented” the conversation which she said she had had with the Appellant. 
       
       
     48 At the conclusion of the Crown case, the Appellant’s counsel applied to have Count 6 withdrawn from the jury on the ground that the evidence which had been given in respect of it was not sufficiently particular with respect to date to enable the count to go to the jury. Having considered the matter, McGuire DCJ later (T. 549) ruled that the evidence did identify the allegation with sufficient particularly and that Count 6 would be left to the jury. 
     49 In his case, the Appellant detailed the sleeping arrangements of the household both before and after renovations to the Rouse Hill house which were begun in 1979. 
      
       
      He then detailed the comings and goings of various people who lived in the house at Rouse Hill over the years. These included the Appellant’s parents, friends of the Complainant, MB – who, in 1981, when he was still a school student, had for one term stayed during the week at the house – HS’s sister, KSP, and a Korean student, YHP, who stayed for around 12-18 months over 1979-1980 and often slept in the Complainant’s bedroom.  
       
       
      The Appellant denied any sexual impropriety ever took place with the Complainant, at Rouse Hill, at the Bondi property, overseas, or anywhere else. The Appellant denied having ever taken the Complainant to an hotel in Sydney. 
       
       
      The Appellant said that he had a very close loving relationship with the Complainant, which relationship would be displayed publicly but not in a way which the Appellant considered inappropriate. This relationship included kissing on the lips but this became more rare as the Complainant grew older. 
       
     50 The notes and cards which the Appellant had written to the Complainant (Exhibits B-N) were described by him as showing the love and affection he felt for her and did not contain expressions of a sexual nature. As an example, the sentence “but I can’t live without our relationship and not be wanted by you, loved by you” in Exhibit D1 were explained by the Appellant in the following way (T.564): 
      
       
       “A. Yes, yes, should I explain that? Well at this stage, she had a couple of boy friends in that period of 1986 to 1989. I don’t know which boyfriend she had at this time. She had a gentleman who she was very fond of and there was a close bond between them. That’s fine. I’m telling her, I don’t expect you to be home just for your family. It is ridiculous. I accept the fact that she has grown up and these things happen when you grow up and I encourage that. But I still felt that she should have time for me and for her other family, family members but particularly me in this family.” 
       
     51 The Appellant said that these cards were not delivered to the Complainant in a secret way but were often left where other members of the family could see them.  
     52 When he came to deal with the confrontation which he had had with SS in January 1990, the Appellant said that he had denied that he had ever molested the Complainant. In addition, the Appellant said that at no time on that day did he have a conversation solely with Mrs. SS and that the conversation of which Mrs. SS had given evidence did not occur. Although the Appellant said that during the course of the confrontation with SS and Mrs. SS he did use words to the effect of “This is no concern of yours” it was in the context of how he raised his children. A little later, during the course of his cross-examination, the Appellant said that if he had, as SS had said, used words to the effect of “I never forced her to do anything” that would have been in the context of the Complainant’s academic achievements. 
     53 When he came to deal with the evidence given by MH, the Appellant said that he went to MH’s office in company with HS for the purpose of collecting documents which belonged to him and which had been left with MH by the Complainant. Those papers, so HS had said during the course of her cross-examination, had been taken by the Complainant from the Appellant’s bank safety deposit box and taken to MH to arrange a divorce for HS. The Appellant said that, when he went to collect the documents, he gave MH a cheque for the amount which she claimed was owed to her and he then took the documents and left. The Appellant said that the conversation of which MH gave evidence did not occur. 
     54 At the conclusion of his evidence-in-chief the Appellant gave evidence of an occasion when, so it was suggested, the Complainant was aged about five, six or seven when, so he said, the Complainant sustained an allergic reaction to a bubble bath, which reaction took the form of red dots and raised skin near the genital area and also on her chest. On that occasion, so the Appellant said, the Complainant was taken to the family’s general practitioner. The Appellant also denied that, at that time, there was any conversation between HS and himself as to any sexual conduct on his part directed towards the Complainant. 
     55 CB, the father of MB, who had, for one term during 1981, stayed with the S family at the house in Rouse Hill, gave evidence that he, his wife and children were accustomed to visit the house at Rouse Hill on four or five occasions a year. His evidence was to the effect that on the occasions when they visited they found the Appellant to be an exemplary father, the affection he showed the Complainant being no greater than he showed to any of his children.  
     56 KSP, HS’s sister, came to Australia in November 1981 and, since that time, had lived with the S family. She slept in each of the children’s bedrooms at some stage or another until TS was born. When the Bondi property was purchased she would stay there for a number of nights each week. Her evidence was that she never saw the Appellant there except during the holidays when he came with the family. She said that she had never seen the Appellant touch the Complainant in a sexual way. 
     57 DS also gave evidence. He said that he had never seen the Appellant behave in a sexual way towards the Complainant. He detailed the confrontation in 1990 with SS and said that the Appellant immediately and forcefully denied the allegations that were made. He said that the Appellant may have used the words: “What is wrong with that” but that referred to pushing the children academically. He was present during the consultation with Dr CQ and said that at one stage the Appellant yelled out words to the effect of: “What do you think she was, my mistress?” DS also said that on occasions such as birthdays or when he had performed well at school, or even when there was no particular reason, the Appellant would give him cards using phrases such as: “To my special guy” or “I love you very much”. 
     58 DS was the last witness called in the Appellant’s case. There was no Crown case in reply.  
     59 In the course of her closing address to the jury, the Crown Prosecutor said (inter alia) (T 801-802): 
      
       
       “So the Crown case is the evidence of (the Complainant). The cards and letters that would lend some support in the various ways that I have described. The admissions made to these people the admissions in relation to (Dr A), (SS and Mrs SS), (MH), (Dr CQ), all of them have either misheard or their (sic) liars. You get this picture of like these people are following (the Complainant) like lemmings over the precipice into this pit of dishonesty that the accused and his sons would suggest. 
       
       
       Let’s not forget the evidence of (AS) and (DS) who says with respect to (Dr CQ) it happened in just exactly the same terms that their father has said. Well, their truthfulness is a matter for you to determine. But you might want to scrutinise their evidence very closely. I don’t propose to go into it in any great depth, but there was much, particularly in relation to what (DS) had to say yesterday that would cause you grave concern about his preparedness to be truthful. I propose you might consider that (HS) was one of these lemmings who saw how far down the precipice she might have been headed and has been back pedalling ever since in order to distance herself from the statement she made back in 1990. 
       
       
       The evidence of (AS) in regard to what happened in 1990 for example he says his dad, as does his dad and (DS), his dad flat out denied the allegations. This wasn’t true, it only lasted an hour and a half or something. But he proceeded to cross-examine his father and I’ll just find it. ‘How often did you ask him? Continuously usually there wouldn’t be an hour went past when I wouldn’t have put it to him.’ And it might be useful to remind you of what it was he got from his father in this cross-examination apart from flat out denials. But I think you have just got to ask him, why would someone keep questioning, why would the son keep questioning his father about something he says he knows not to be true, about something his father has flat out denied, and he continues for the rest of the time. 
       
       
       ……………………………………………………………………………………. 
        
       It just doesn’t ring true at all what he has had to say about that. You might get the impression that he is trying to conceal this, “Do you think you have a mental problem?’ ‘I don’t know, maybe I do.’ ‘Why did you do all of those things to (the Complainant)?’ ‘I don’t know’. A patent admission. You might think that (AS) is going out of his way to conceal those words by saying well look, I just wore him down by questioning and he just got tired of this and just gave me those answers, that seems to be what he is saying”. 
       
     60 The transcript records the following after the conclusion of the Crown Prosecutor’s final address to the jury (p 810): 
      
       
       “BELLANTO: May I raise a matter. The Crown Prosecutor, in relation to (AS’s) evidence made a number of criticisms and, doing the best we can, I think they amount to these two points: the jury should question his truthfulness and the jury should scrutinise carefully his evidence, particularly in the light of his devotion to his father. Secondly, his account of his cross-examination of his father did not ring true and he was trying to conceal the tacit admissions of his father. I am not suggesting that is entirely word for word but I think this is the gist of what has been suggested. 
       
       
       HIS HONOUR: Truthfulness should be carefully scrutinised. His evidence in the light of his devotion to his father, his account of his cross-examination of the father didn’t ring true. What else did you say? 
       
       
       BELLANTO: He was trying to conceal the tacit admissions of his father in the light of that cross-examination by him. I think that’s generally what the learned Crown was putting to the jury. 
       
       
       In our submission the Crown Prosecutor should tell the jury that (AS) was a Crown witness and the Crown had no obligation to call him, and that he was provided with no opportunity to respond to the criticisms made by the Crown”. 
       
       
      and, later (T 814-815): 
       
       
       “HIS HONOUR: … 
       
       
       Because in this case the Crown, right from the outset made it plain that the Crown regarded (AS) as a hostile witness and wanted him treated as an unfavourable witness. And as I recall it you stop (sic) me in (sic) I am wrong, there was a voir dire examination of (AS) and it was following that that I refused the Crown’s application to treat him as unfavourable. You really can’t have it both ways. You have asked me not to declare him unfavourable not to give the Crown the opportunity to cross-examine him and now you say the Crown is to be averted from any criticism of (AS). You know that the rules of evidence don’t allow the Crown to cross-examine a witness he not having been declared unfavourable. 
       
       
       BELLANTO: It is not that the Crown should not criticise him, it is that the Crown should balance that by saying to the jury he has told lies, he is been (sic) untruthful, he is protecting his dad, you don’t have to accept his denials that he wasn’t doing that but bear in mind he hasn’t had the opportunity to respond to that. Nor we seek is a balance. I suppose I do not say the Crown doesn’t have the right to criticise the Crown’s witnesses, but that addendum be added that he hasn’t had that opportunity, that is all. 
       
       
       HIS HONOUR: Well, Mr Bellanto, you would concede I think that he was in your camp? 
       
       
       BELLANTO: Yes. 
       
       
       HIS HONOUR: Now, you had the opportunity to cross-examine him and you were in the position to be able to put to him matters which could have addressed this problem, weren’t you? 
       
       
       BELLANTO: There are a number of reasons why one takes a view about how far one cross-examines a witness that might be seen to be favourable. There are questions which are often seen as inappropriate. But the bottom line I suppose for us was that we didn’t have to because he had already denied certain matters and his evidence, we would say, stood firm in the way he expressed himself in chief and that we were content with that. 
       
       
       HIS HONOUR: As I say if any mistake was made it was my mistake in not declaring him unfavourable and giving the accused that advantage. 
       
       
       BELLANTO: If your Honour pleases”. 
       
     61 At the outset of his summing-up McGuire DCJ, when discussing the relative functions of himself and the jury, said (SU 19/01/01 p 3): 
      
       
       “As judges of the facts you are entitled to be selective, you are entitled to sift the evidence. You can look at a witness and say I believe all of his evidence or I believe none of it or I accept this part, however, I am a bit doubtful as to that. So, in short you place to one side that which you consider reliable, reject which you consider to be unreliable. The mere fact that you think a witness might be unreliable as to one facet of his or her evidence doesn’t mean you have to reject that witness. You may do so, but you do not have to”. 
       
     62 A little later (SU 19/01/01 pp 4-5) McGuire DCJ said: 
      
       
       “It is easy to be sympathetic towards a woman, a girl as she was, who says that she has been sexually molested. It is also easy to be sympathetic towards a man who sits in the dock in a criminal court. He sits there alone, obviously, facing serious charges. You put aside all sympathies, you put aside all biases. 
       
       
       As a matter of commonsense you know that people do molest their children. You know that teachers molest pupils, priests and ministers molest little children, their parishioners. Scout masters have molested cubs and little scouts. You see reports of such matters every second day. You see and hear what occurs on television, you view it every night. So, there is no question that this sort of crime does occur. You might have had experience within the range of your own families or friends. You must put aside what know (sic) or what you think know (sic) about some other matter.  
       
       
       This accused is entitled to be tried by you on the basis of the evidence in this Court. So no bias, no prejudice, no sympathy. Your oath or your affirmation requires you to be cold, hard and dispassionate. If the Crown has proved its case, you convict. If it has not, you acquit”. 
       
     63 Later (SU 19/01/01, pp 11-12) McGuire DCJ, after referring to the fact that there were seven counts in the indictment, said: 
      
       
       “Because there are seven crimes charged, seven counts on the indictment, you are obliged to consider each of the charges separately attributing to each charge the evidence which relates to that charge alone. The circumstances giving rise to each charge are somewhat different in relation to the time and the place and the sexual activity described. When considering each charge it is important for you to remember that you are entitled to return different verdicts, that is to say you do not have to automatically return seven guilty verdicts or seven not guilty verdicts. You might feel that in relation to one particular charge, two, three, more, whatever, that there is some doubt, some reasonable doubt. And if that were so you would acquit. At the same time you might find in relation to some other charges that there was no reasonable doubt. As I say to you, you look at each charge separately, it is not a case of one in, all in, or one out, all out. 
       
       
       What I suggest you do is that you consider the evidence in relation to the first count, arrive at your verdict and move to consider the material relating to the second count and arrive at your verdict and so on. Compartmentalise your evidence. Some of the evidence of course is common to all of the counts, but there is some evidence which is peculiar or specific to a particular count”.  
       
       
      and a little later (SU 19/01/01 p 13): 
       
       
       “Returning to this case, let me make it perfectly clear it is the law that you can convict on the basis of the unsupported evidence of the complainant alone, provided that you find her to be an essentially reliable and honest witness with regard to the sexual misconduct she described. So what you do is look at all of the evidence, including the complainant’s evidence, and determine the question of whether the accused’s guilt has been established beyond reasonable doubt in relation to each of the counts on the indictment”. 
       
     64 McGuire DCJ returned to the question of the Complainant’s evidence a little later (SU 19/01/01 p 14), where he said: 
      
       
       “It would be plain to you, ladies and gentlemen, that the Crown case stands or falls upon the evidence of the complainant. Her account is fundamental to the Crown case. It is therefore essential that you carefully scrutinise her evidence. Remember what she said and the manner in which she gave her account. It is for you the jury to say whether the complainant gave an honest and reliable account with regard to the essential features of her evidence as to the sexual misconduct she described. There may be inconsistencies with regard to matters of no real importance. However, carefully consider her account and pose the question; ‘Was she both honest and reliable when she told you what the accused, her father, did to her?’ If you find that she was, such a finding may be used as a basis for a guilty verdict. If you do not conclude that she was both honest and reliable as to the essential features of her account, then it would not be open to you to find the accused (sic) guilt proved beyond reasonable doubt”. 
       
     65 When he resumed his summing-up on the following Monday, McGuire DCJ said (inter alia) (SU 22/01/01 pp 2-3): 
      
       
       “As you are aware, the events complained of are said to have commenced in 1974 and to have concluded in 1988. You will appreciate that the accused in this case has lost the opportunity to have accounted for his movements to have accurately accounted for his movements at the times in question. He has lost the opportunity to have called witnesses as to what occurred in relation to sleeping arrangements in (the Complainant’s) room or in relation to the country trips, when he told you that (Mr R) travelled with he (sic) and (the Complainant). 
       
       
       The Korean lady has disappeared. (Mr R) has died, as have the accused’s parents. You must therefore carefully scrutinise her evidence in satisfying yourself as to whether she did or did not give you a truthful and accurate accounts (sic) of the sexual assaults complained of. 
       
       
       Unless you were completely satisfied as to the reliability of her evidence, it would be dangerous to convict on her evidence alone. What you must do is carefully scrutinise what she said. If you consider that she was both truthful and reliable, act upon her evidence. If you do not believe that she was both truthful and reliable you would reject her evidence in relation to such of her accounts where you found that she was or could have been unreliable.  
       
       
       To recapitulate, what you do is you look at the evidence in relation to each charge, as it were, in a separate compartment. Go to the next charge and look at the evidence which relates to it and so on”. 
       
     66 The transcript records (SU 22/01/01 pp 57-58) the following discussion which occurred in the absence of the jury at the conclusion of McGuire DCJ’s summing-up, but before he requested the jury to retire to consider their verdict: 
      
       
       “CROWN PROSECUTOR: The other matter is in relation to what use the jury might make of the complaint evidence. As the law currently stands I understand that the Crown would be entitled subject to any exercise of discretion by the trial Judge, the Crown would be entitled to the jury use (sic) complaint evidence as the truth of what is asserted, I have had some discussion with Mr Bellanto about this during the course of the trial and ultimately in my address to the jury I stepped away from that proposition of her complaint or the complaint to (HS) should be used as the truth as what is asserted, rather I suppose to go to the old use for which it was put of consistency of conduct and so on. I believe the current position in relation to that is though, the jury needs to be told exactly what use they should make of that evidence. 
       
       
       HIS HONOUR: Crown I think you are right, I think it is available to the jury to use complaint, the contents of complaint as truth of what was asserted but I have a discretion on that do I not? 
       
       
       CROWN PROSECUTOR: You do your Honour. 
       
       
       HIS HONOUR: The complaint to which she refers was made when she was six or thereabouts and I do not propose to put to the jury that they can use that as evidence of the truth of what was raised. 
       
       
       CROWN PROSECUTOR: I must say that’s precisely why I stepped away from the idea that the concept of it should be used as the truth of the contents but I believe there is a decision somewhere, I can’t think of it right now, that would indicate the jury should know what use they put the piece or to what you can say make of a piece of evidence. 
       
       
       HIS HONOUR: By way of consistency or ? 
       
       
       CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, I think that would be the only use to which they could put it. 
       
       
       HIS HONOUR: Well no doubt when we come back you will be able to hand me a copy of that, won’t you. What do you say Mr Bellanto as to that matter? 
       
       
       BELLANTO: On that. Well I agree with your Honour with respect that it’s only a matter of background material bearing on the evidence, not the truth of what is asserted. 
       
       
       HIS HONOUR: Well do you suggest that I or do you want me to give any direction with regard, any further direction with regard to complaint? 
       
       
       BELLANTO: Only that your Honour would tell them that it is not evidence of the truth. 
       
       
       HIS HONOUR: Well no …  
       
       
       BELLANTO: But I appreciate – I know what that may involve. 
       
       
       HIS HONOUR: It is only because of some interpretation of the Evidence Act, that that is the situation. If they are not told anything about it, it doesn’t enlighten them on the issue.  
       
       
       BELLANTO: Yes. 
       
       
       HIS HONOUR: Now I’m not going to tell them that they can’t use it as evidence of the truth because they would be entitled to use it as evidence of the truth. It’s just that I’m not going to as a matter of discretion instruct them to that effect. But I am not going to tell, I’m not going to go to the extent of putting it in the negative, that they can’t do so. 
       
       
       BELLANTO: Well I think in those circumstances your Honour should leave it alone”. 
       
     67 In the event, the only further direction which McGuire DCJ gave to the jury before they retired to consider their verdict was one which had been sought by the Appellant’s counsel as to the motives which it had been suggested that the Complainant might have to lie, which direction was as follows (SU 22/01/01 pp 64-65): 
      
       
       “Ladies and gentlemen, the accused does not have to advance any motive, nor does he have to prove any motive. Even if you do not accept any motive advanced, that does not constitute any proof of guilt. It does not entitle you to confer that the complainant’s account was correct merely because you disbelieve the motive that has been suggested. You would still have to find the guilt of the accused on the whole of the evidence. So you simply do not say, well, I do not accept that that was a motive, therefore that establishes that what (the Complainant) said was correct and that constitutes some proof of his guilt. Even if you don’t accept the motive, you still have to look at all of the evidence and determine whether the guilt of the accused has been proved to the requisite onus”. 
       
     68 When the appeal was called on for hearing, Mr W G Dawe QC appeared for the Crown while Mr P L G Brereton SC appeared with Mr P Lowe for the Appellant.  
     69 Although, in accordance with the usual practice, written submissions had been filed on behalf of the Appellant prior to the appeal being called on for hearing, in the course of his opening the appeal, Mr Brereton said (T 2): 
      
       
       “May I outline the way in which I propose orally to develop the submissions for reasons which, I hope, are logical. They will not follow the sequence of the written submissions and I do not propose orally to develop all the grounds of my written submissions. If I can outline the course I do propose to embark upon: the first submission will be that the guilty verdicts on counts 1 and 3 to 7 are unreasonable and cannot be supported, having regard to the acquittal on count 2, and that encompasses grounds 9 and 10.  
       
       
       The second submission is that the trial Judge failed to give the jury a Markuleski (sic) direction when such a direction was called for. That encompasses ground 8 (a) and (b). The third is that the trial miscarried by reason of misuse of the permission afforded to the Crown to recall (Dr CQ); that is ground 4. 
       
       
       The fourth submission is that in his Honour’s summing-up, the trial Judge first failed to give appropriate directions in respect of the appellant’s son (AS) to the effect that he had been afforded no opportunity to answer the criticisms made of him by the Crown; that is ground 3. And secondly, to the appellant’s prejudice commented on prevalence of the type of offence in question in the community; that is ground 8 (d).  
       
       
       The fifth submission will be that the prosecution of counts 5, 6 and 7 was null and void by reason of the absence of a valid sanction of the Attorney General under section 78F of the Crimes Act. I do not propose to address orally grounds 2, 6, 7, 8 (c) and (b) and 11”. 
       
     70 In the circumstances it seems convenient to deal with the submissions in the order outlined by Mr Brereton.  
      
       
       
      Ground 9 The verdicts are inconsistent 
       
      Ground 10 The verdict cannot be supported having regard to the evidence 
     71 Reduced to its most simple form, the submission which was made on behalf of the Appellant in respect of these two grounds of appeal was that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, the basis for that submission being what was said to be the inconsistency between the verdicts found on counts 1, 3 and 4-7 on the one hand, and that found on ground 2 on the other. In the course of developing that submission, Mr Brereton referred to the recent decision of this Court in R v Markuleski ([2001] NSWCCA 290) which decision he accepted as having wrought a return to the primacy of MacKenzie v The Queen ((1996) 190 CLR 348) and which had disapproved of the approach which had earlier been taken by this Court in R v RAT ((2000) 111 A Crim R 360). As put by Mr Brereton (T 2): 
      
       
       “In my submission the test now is whether the verdicts are logically and reasonably irreconcilable, and that test is not satisfied where there is nothing to differentiate the evidence of the complainant on the count on which there is an acquittal, from those on which there are convictions”. 
       
     72 With respect, it seems to me that the judgment of Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ, which judgment, in this respect, was concurred in by Dawson and Toohey JJ, in MacKenzie v The Queen (supra) does not, in my view, support so bald a submission. In the course of their judgment Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ said (inter alia), (supra) at 366-368: 
      
       
       “From a review of the cases, a number of general propositions can be stated: 
       
       
       (1) A distinction must be drawn between cases of legal or technical inconsistency and cases of suggested factual inconsistency.  
       
       …………………… 
       
       
       (2) Suggestions of factual inconsistency have arisen both as between different verdicts affecting the same accused and different verdicts affecting the co-accused or persons tried separately in relation to connected events. 
       
       
        ……………………… 
       
       
       (3) Where, as is ordinarily the case, the inconsistency arises in the jury verdicts upon different counts of the originating process in a criminal trial, the test is one of logic and reasonableness. A judgment of Devlin J in R v Stone is often cited as expressing the test:  
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘He must satisfy the court that the two verdicts cannot stand together, meaning thereby that no reasonable jury who had applied their mind properly to the facts in the case could have arrived at the conclusion, and once one assumes that they are an unreasonable jury, or they could not have reasonably come to the conclusion, then the convictions cannot stand’. 
          
         
        
       
       
       (4) Nevertheless the respect for the function that the law assigns the juries (and the general satisfaction with their performance) have led courts to express repeatedly, in the context both of criminal and civil trials, reluctance to accept a submission that verdicts are inconsistent in the relevant sense. Thus, if there is a proper way by which the appellate court may reconcile the verdicts, allowing it to conclude that the jury performed their functions as required, that conclusion will generally be accepted. If there is some evidence to support the verdict said to be inconsistent, it is not the role of the appellate court, upon this ground, to substitute its opinion of the facts for one which was open to the jury. In a criminal appeal, the view may be taken that the jury simply followed the judge’s instruction to consider separately the case presented by the prosecution in respect of each count and to apply to each count the requirement that all the ingredients must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Alternatively, the appellate court may conclude that the jury took a ‘merciful’ view of the facts upon one count: a function which has always been open to, and often exercised by, juries. 
       
       
       ……………………………………… 
       
       
       (5) Nevertheless, a residue of cases will remain where the different verdicts returned by the jury represent, on the public record, an affront to logic and commonsense which is unacceptable and strongly suggests a compromise of the performance of the jury’s duty. More commonly, it may suggest confusion in the minds of the jury or a misunderstanding of their function, uncertainty about the legal differentiation between the offences or lack of clarity in the judicial instruction on the applicable law. It is only where the inconsistency rises to the point that the appellate court considers that intervention is necessarily required to prevent a possible injustice that the relevant conviction will be set aside. It is impossible to state hard and fast rules. ‘It all depends upon the facts of the case’.”  
       
     73 Let it be assumed, however, that Mr Brereton is correct when he asserts that the test of whether or not verdicts are logically and reasonably reconcilable is incapable of being satisfied where there is nothing to differentiate the evidence of the complainant on the account on which there is an acquittal from that on those counts on which there are convictions. The submission that the present is a case in which that test has not been satisfied appears to proceed upon the bases, first, that the current case stood or fell upon the evidence of the Complainant in the sense that hers was the only direct evidence as to any of the offences charged, and, second, that no – or, at least, no reliable – corroborative material had been tendered to support the Complainant’s evidence, it following – so it appeared to be submitted – that the jury could not, as a matter of logic, accept the Complainant’s evidence as to counts, 1, 3 and 4-7, while at the same time not accepting her evidence as to count 2.  
     74 With respect, it seems to me that, so put, the submission overstates the position, and that there are several answers to it: 
      
       
      (1) The statement made by HS to Constable McGrath in February 1990 did contain material supportive of the evidence given by the Complainant as to the events which were the subject of counts 1 and 3, albeit that, as I have earlier recorded, in the course of her oral evidence at trial, HS asserted that what was contained in the statement was only what she had been told by the Complainant in 1990, before which she had no suspicions, and that the Complainant’s account of the events the subject of counts 1 and 3 had never occurred; 
       
       
      (2) As is apparent from what I have earlier recorded, the first 3 counts in the indictment charged the appellant with indecent assault. In the course of his summing-up, McGuire DCJ gave the jury the following direction (S/U 19/01/01, pp 9-10): 
       
       
        
         
          
          “If you go to the indictment you will see that the first three counts involve allegations of what we call indecent assault. The matters which the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt in relation to those first three counts are as follows. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (1) Within the periods mentioned in those first three counts the accused assaulted (the complainant). That is the first thing. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (2) The second is at that time he committed an act of indecency. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Assault, in this context does not mean punching somebody in the nose or hitting them with a stick. It simply means the intentional unlawful touching of another person without that person’s consent and without lawful excuse. The assaults and the acts of indecency alleged are one and the same thing. If there was a touching of somebody in an indecent fashion that constitutes an indecent assault. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          There is no definition within the law as to what constitutes indecency. It simply means conduct which is contrary to the ordinary standards of decency of people in the community. As jurors you represent the community and it is for you to judge whether any conduct which you find proved against the accused offends against the ordinary standards of decency of people in your community. So if you find that the matters charged, that is to say the actions charged: the touching, the various acts covered by those counts, if you find those actions occurred, you then ask yourself, ‘well, do those actions constitute indecency?’ If you find both of those matters proved then there is to be a guilty verdict. If you don’t find both of those matters proved beyond a reasonable doubt then you acquit.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        There is, as it seems to me, a different quality in relation to the conduct of which the Complainant gave evidence in relation to counts 1 and 3 and that of which she gave in relation to count 2 and it may be that the jury took the view that the conduct of which the Complainant gave evidence in relation to count 2 did not constitute an assault or did not involve the Appellant committing an act of indecency upon the Complainant.  
        
       
       
      (3) Other evidence which could have been regarded as supportive of the evidence given by the Complainant, particularly in regard to counts 4-7, was that given by Mrs A as to her conversation with HS, the evidence of SS and Mrs SS as to their confrontation with the Appellant in January 1990, the evidence of Dr CQ on what occurred at the family consultation in 1991, the evidence of MH as to her conversation with the Appellant when he came to her office in 1990, and the various cards and letters which were tendered as exhibits B-N. 
       
       
      (4) Finally, there is the fact that, as I have earlier recorded, in the course of his summing-up, McGuire DCJ directed the jury that they were obliged to consider each of the charges separately, attributing to that charge the evidence which related to it alone, it following that, in the present case, the jury simply followed his Honour’s instruction to consider separately the case presented by the Crown in respect of each count and to apply to each count the requirement that all the ingredients must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. 
       
     75 These matters lead me to the conclusion that this Court should not interfere on these grounds as the verdicts on several counts do not themselves render the convictions for the appellant unsafe or unsatisfactory. 
      
       
      Ground 8 
       
       
      The trial Judge erred in his directions to the jury by: 
       
       
      (a) failing to adequately and/or properly direct the jury in that, in directing the jury to look at each count on the indictment separately, he failed to direct the jury that they were entitled to take into account any reasonable doubt in respect of one count when considering the other counts; 
       
       
      (b) by failing to warn the jury that in the circumstances of this case should they have a reasonable doubt in respect to the complainant’s evidence on any count, such ought to be taken into account on the complainant’s credibility and truthfulness generally. 
       
     76 It is to be observed that, notwithstanding that, at trial, the Appellant was represented by a very senior and experienced member of the inner Bar, no such directions as are now suggested should have been given were sought from McGuire DCJ even though, as is the practice, at the end of McGuire DCJ’s summing-up counsel were invited to indicate whether, and if so what, further directions were required. This notwithstanding, it seems to me appropriate to consider the merits of the submissions before finally determining whether or not leave to raise questions ought to be granted. 
     77 In the developing the submission Mr Brereton prayed in aid some of the observations made by Spigelman CJ and others made by Wood CJ at CL in their respective judgments in R v Markuleski (supra). 
     78 In the course of his judgment in R v Markuleski (supra) Spigelman CJ wrote (inter alia): 
      
       
       “173 The appellant made two distinct criticisms of the directions with respect to the jury’s assessment of the credibility of the complainant. 
       
       
       174 The first criticism was the failure of the trial judge to expressly inform the jury that the delay in the making of the complaint was itself a matter to be taken into account in assessment of the credibility of the complainant. The second criticism was the failure of the trial Judge to direct the jury as to the assessment of the complainant’s credibility if the jury were minded to acquit on any count. 
       
       
       ……………………………… 
       
       
       176 In this case the central significance of the credibility of the complainant must have been obvious to the jury. His Honour informed them that they needed to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt ‘as to the truth and reliability of the evidence that she gives’. His other directions reinforced the proposition. 
       
       
       177 It may be reasonably obvious to most persons that delay in coming forward in the making of a complaint is required to be taken into account in assessing credibility. Nevertheless in a case such as the present, where delays are a lengthy period, in my opinion, a direction of this character should have been given to ensure a fair trial. 
       
       
       178 In view of the clear direction that the Crown did depend on the complainant’s evidence and the strong  
       Longman 
        warning I may have been minded to reach the same conclusion as in  
       Davies 
        that the complainant’s credibility had been adequately left to the jury. However, when this omission is combined with the next matter complained of, a different conclusion is appropriate. 
       
       
       ……………………………………… 
       
       
       181 The appellant eventually relied on alternative formulations of a direction requiring the jury to take into account the failure of the complainant’s evidence to satisfy it beyond reasonable doubt in one or more respects on any count, when assessing her evidence on other counts. In this respect the appellant relied on the observations of Fitzgerald JA in  
       R v Robinson 
        (2000) 111 A Crim R 388 at [9]: 
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The circumstances might be such that the jury should also be instructed that if they hold a reasonable doubt concerning the reliability of a complainant’s evidence on one or more counts, whether by reference to the complainant’s demeanour or for any other reason, they must take that into account in assessing the reliability of his or her evidence in relation to other counts’. 
          
         
        
       
       
       …………………………………… 
       
       
       183 Fitzgerald JA’s observations in  
       Robinson 
        were made in a context in which his Honour had identified the usual practice of directing a jury to consider each count separately and tell it that it was entitled to accept part of what a witness said and reject other parts. His Honour indicated that directions of this character may not always be sufficient. 
       
       
       184 As with many aspects of the process of weighing evidence, a judge may be able to assist the jury by drawing its attention to certain matters, even matters which would be regarded by many to be obvious. I express considerable reluctance to add to the number of directions and warnings which trial judges are already required to give. McHugh J noted in  
       KRM v The Queen 
        (2000) 75 ALJR 550; [2000] HCA 11 at [37]:  
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The more directions and warnings juries are given the more likely it is that they will forget or misinterpret some directions or warnings’. 
          
         
        
       
       
       185 Nevertheless, the case law of inconsistent verdicts, particularly in the context of sexual assault cases but not limited to that context, indicates that there is recurring difficulty in this respect. It may appear to be obvious that a reasonable doubt about one aspect of a complainant’s evidence ought to be taken into account when assessing that witness’s evidence on other matters. However, there have been a significant number of cases in which Courts of Criminal Appeal have acted on the basis that the jury may have failed to do so. 
       
       
       186 In the light of the number of cases it is desirable that the traditional direction as to treating each count separately is supplemented in a word against word case. Some reference ought to be made to the effect upon the assessment of the credibility of a complainant if the jury finds itself unable to accept the complainant’s evidence with respect to any count”. 
       
     79 Not dissimilar passages may be found in the judgment of Wood CJ at CL. Thus, after a reference to the observations of Fitzgerald JA in R v Robinson (supra), his Honour wrote: 
      
       
       “261 I see no reason to confine the direction to reliability. It is equally, if not more, applicable in relation to credibility or truthfulness. Moreover, I see no reason to do more than bring to the attention of the jury the circumstance that, depending upon the nature of, and the degree of, any question which arises in relation to the evidence going to the count in respect of which they have a reasonable doubt, it is both permissible and proper for them to take that into account when considering the evidence of the complainant or central witness upon the remaining counts.  
       
       
       262 This should, however, be kept in context in that the jury should be reminded that it is but one of the circumstances that they can properly take into account, when evaluating the overall credibility and reliability of the complainant, as it impacts upon the remaining counts, including any other fact or circumstance which may provide an explanation for any question which may arise. It is, in my view, inappropriate for any direction, or comment, in this regard to become elevated by reason of the mandatory terms in which it is expressed, to a principle of law or to operate as a straightjacket for the jury. 
       
       
       263 In some cases, where it is obvious that the witness’s reliability or credibility has been seriously undermined in relation to one count, a strong comment may be appropriate. In other cases it may be appropriate to indicate to the jury that they may have a difficulty in accepting the witness’s evidence on some counts, or on particular counts, if they have a reasonable doubt about his or her reliability in relation to other counts. In other cases a more neutral reminder of the entitlement of the jury to take such a matter into account may suffice. In yet other cases, it may not be necessary to say anything”. 
       
     80 In the light of the submission advanced on behalf of the Appellant, the following matters should be noted: 
      
       
      (1) As I have pointed out, in the course of his summing-up McGuire DCJ directed the jury that in the light of the fact that there were 7 counts in the indictment they were required to consider each of the charges separately, attributing to each charge the evidence which related to it alone; 
       
       
      (2) In the course of his summing-up, McGuire DCJ directed the jury that the Complainant’s account was fundamental to the Crown case and that it was therefore essential that they carefully scrutinise her evidence and, if they did not conclude that the Complainant was both honest and reliable as to the essential features of her account, then it would not be open to them to find the accused’s guilt proved beyond a reasonable doubt; 
       
       
      (3) In the course of his summing-up, McGuire DCJ gave the jury a strong  
      Longman 
        
      direction and pointed out that, unless they were completely satisfied as to the reliability of the Complainant’s evidence, it would be dangerous to convict on her evidence alone; 
       
       
      (4) While, as I have earlier noted, it was true that the only witnesses to give direct evidence as to the matters the subject of the several counts in the indictment were the Complainant and the Appellant it was not, in my view, a “word against word case”; on the contrary, as I have earlier recorded, there was evidence to which the Crown Prosecutor, in the course of her final address, and McGuire DCJ, in the course of his summing-up, drew attention which was supportive of the evidence given by the Complainant.  
       
     81 These matters, in my view, make it appropriate to refer to what was said by Hunt J (as he then was), with whom Slattery CJ at CL and Carruthers J concurred, in R v Davies ((1985) 3 NSWLR 276), to which Spigelman CJ referred in the course of his judgment in R v Markuleski (supra), which passage was as follows (supra) at 279: 
      
       
       “The trial judge did give detailed directions to the jury concerning the credit of the complainant, and concerning the conflicts between her evidence and the evidence of the witnesses for the accused. The jury could not have been under any misapprehension as to the relevance to her credit of the conflict between the complainant and Wilson as to making the complaint. But that circumstance does not meet the appellants’ argument. It was never put specifically to the jury that the failure to complain was itself relevant to the complainant’s credit. Mr Hidden on behalf of the appellants said that this was the very sort of case which cried out for such a direction to be given. If this was so, it is surprising that not one of the four experienced counsel who appeared on behalf of the accused thought it necessary to ask the trial judge to give such a direction. Quite apart from the requirement of the Criminal Appeal Rules r 4, that circumstance is eloquent evidence that the impression conveyed by his Honour’s summing-up at the time was that the issue of the complainant’s credibility had been adequately put before the jury. It may well be relevant also to the issue under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 s 6, as to whether a substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred, but it is unnecessary for me to explore that issue in this case. 
       
       
       In my judgment, leave to rely as a ground of appeal upon the omission to give any direction in accordance with  
       Kilby’s 
        case should be refused and the ground of appeal itself should be rejected”. 
       
     82 In this case I am of the view that leave to rely on these grounds of appeal should be refused, and these grounds of appeal themselves should be rejected. 
      
       
       
      Ground 4 
       
       
      The trial Judge erred in permitting the Crown to recall (Dr CQ), a Crown witness following the appellant giving evidence in his defence 
       
     83 It will be seen that, as framed, this ground differs from the ground – that the trial miscarried by reason of the misuse of the permission afforded to the Crown to recall (Dr CQ) – sought to be advanced by Mr Brereton.  
     84 Given the facts, first, that, as I have earlier recorded, it was Mr Bellanto who indicated to McGuire DCJ his view that Dr CQ should be recalled if that were the Crown Prosecutor’s wish, and, second, that when Dr CQ was recalled no objection was taken by Mr Bellanto to the evidence which she gave in chief, and no application was made by him to have that evidence struck out, it is my view that this ground of appeal as originally taken should be rejected and the ground of appeal now sought to be advanced by Mr Brereton should not be entertained. 
      
       
      Ground 3 
       
       
      The trial judge failed to adequately and/or properly direct the jury in relation to the Crown Prosecutor’s criticism of (AS), a Crown witness, by failing to direct the jury that the witness had not been given the opportunity to respond to the assertions made by the Crown 
       
     85 I have recorded above (para 59) that part of the Crown Prosecutor’s final address to the jury which forms the basis for this ground of appeal, as also have I recorded above (para 60) the application which was later made by the Appellant’s counsel and part of the discussion which followed the making of that application. 
     86 The following observations might be made in relation to that part of the Crown Prosecutor’s final address: 
      
       
      (1) As is apparent, the criticism is not limited to the evidence of AS but relates also to the evidence of DS and that of HS; 
       
       
      (2) As, in the course of that discussion (T 811) McGuire DCJ was to observe, in the circumstances the Crown was obliged to call AS as a witness; 
       
       
      (3) As I have earlier recorded (para 39), on two occasions the Crown Prosecutor sought leave pursuant to s 38 of the  
      Evidence Act 1995  
      to cross-examine AS because of what were said to be inconsistencies between his oral evidence and certain parts of the written statement which had been given to the police. At the time when the Crown Prosecutor made the first of those applications, an examination of AS on the voir dire was conducted, during the course of which that statement was put to AS and, at a number of points, he appeared to suggest, either, that words attributed to him had not been spoken by him, or alternatively, that, although he had perused the statement before signing it, he had not read it carefully. At the conclusion of that examination and after the jury had been recalled the Crown Prosecutor at McGuire DCJ’s suggestion (T 455) directed AS’s attention to various passages in the statement and asked whether he had adhered to the words recorded in those passages. It was the answers he then gave which led to the second application by the Crown Prosecutor; 
       
       
      (4) As, in the course of the discussion on the application made by Mr Bellanto, McGuire DCJ observed, Mr Bellanto had opposed the Crown Prosecutor’s application for leave to cross-examine (T 449) and, further, exercised the right to cross-examine AS (T 460-471); 
       
       
      (5) Finally, as, in the course of that discussion Mr Bellanto had conceded, AS was clearly in the Appellant’s camp. 
       
     87 In seeking to develop this ground of appeal Mr Brereton submitted that, where it is to be submitted that the evidence of a witness may be unreliable, and it has never been suggested to that witness that he or she was unreliable, he or she should be given the opportunity to answer the attack on his or her evidence, in default of which it is incumbent on a trial judge to a give a clear direction in the summing-up as to how the jury should approach the evidence of that witness - a submission to support which reference was made to the judgment of this Court in R v ATM ([2000] NSWCCA 475) - and that, in the absence of such a direction the Accused would have had an unfair trial a submission to support which reference was made to the decision of this Court in MRW ((1995) 113 A Crim R 308). 
     88 With respect, it seems to me that this was not a case calling for a direction such as was contended for by Mr Brereton. The situation in this case was far from that under consideration in R v ATM, albeit that what was there involved was an appeal against conviction on two charges of child sexual assault. The particular question considered in R v ATM was the apparent contradiction between the evidence of two medical practitioners called during the Crown case, a Dr Amin, a General Practitioner who had examined the Complainant following a complaint and who found no evidence of bruising and found that the hymen was intact, and a Dr Marks, a Medical Practitioner with a Post Graduate degree in Paediatrics employed in the Child Protection Unit at the Children’s Hospital at Westmead, who had not spoken to Dr Amin but had examined her, who gave evidence (inter alia) of cases where there had been a mistaken interpretation made of the state of a child’s hymen and explained how that might occur. 
     89 In the course of his judgment, Howie J, with whom Sully and Whealy JJ agreed, wrote (inter alia): 
      
       
       “54 One of the difficulties with this area of the evidence was that because Dr Amin was called by the Crown and as the defence did not wish to undermine her evidence, her expertise and the reliability of her examination were never called into question except indirectly by the evidence of Dr Marks. Yet Dr Marks had never spoken to Dr Amin about her examination of the Complainant or the course she normally followed when examining the genitalia of a young child. Nor was it ever suggested to Dr Amin during her evidence that she was inexperienced in examining the sexual organs of young children or that she may have been mistaken in what she thought was the Complainant’s hymen, or that there may have been damage which she did not observe or note.  
       
       
       55 At the very least it seems to me to have been unfair to Dr Amin that the jury might have been left to consider her evidence on the basis that it may have been unreliable when this was never suggested to Dr Amin and she was never given the opportunity to answer the attack upon her evidence, which at least must have been implied by the Crown calling Dr Marks. There were no directions in the summing-up as to how the jury should approach this evidence except by the judge summarising the submissions made by both counsel. 
       
       
       56 Perhaps the answer to what I consider to have been the unsatisfactory nature of this part of the evidence was for the Crown to have sought leave to treat Dr Amin as an unfavourable witness and tested her evidence under Section 38 of the Evidence Act. In  
       R v Milat 
        (SC (NSW)) Hunt CJ at CL, unreported, 23 April 1996) it was held that the section could be applied where a witness was called by the Crown to permit cross-examination by the defence. Here the Crown was calling the evidence under its duty to put all relevant material before the jury. I note that the operation of the section is under consideration by the High Court which granted Special Leave to Appeal from the decision of this Court in  
       R v Adam 
        (1999) 47 NSWLR 267. 
       
       
       57 By itself the evidence of Dr Amin was not decisive. It was open to the jury to consider the evidence of the findings of Dr Amin in the light of the evidence of Dr Marks and conclude that the results of Dr Amin’s examination of the Complainant were not so inconsistent with the Complainant’s version that the Complainant could not be telling the truth. But in light of the Complainant’s evidence of repeated acts of penetration over a number of years leading up to the medical examination in September 1992, the evidence of Dr Amin hardly inspires confidence in the reliability of the Complainant’s evidence”. 
       
     90 In the present case, it seems to me that AS could not have been under any misapprehension about the fact that the Crown was seeking to suggest that the oral evidence he had given was inconsistent with what was contained in the statement which he had earlier given to the police and that it was for that reason unreliable. This being so, it does not seem to me that the comment made by the Crown Prosecutor in the course of her final address to the jury was unfair. 
     91 Further, it is to be noted that, at an early stage in his summing-up (SU 19/01/01 p 8), McGuire DCJ observed: 
      
       
       “You will have observed that some witnesses called by the Crown gave evidence that suited the Prosecutor’s case and some of the evidence given by those witnesses suited the Accused. In a prosecution such as this, the Crown is under an obligation to place witnesses before you, as a matter of fairness, if those witnesses can give relevant evidence, regardless of whether their account suited the Prosecution or suited the Accused.  
       
       
       Snippets of evidence from the previous trials have been quoted. Quite rightly, witnesses were taken to what they said in some proceedings in this trial in this Court some 10 or 11 months ago. You have also been referred to extracts and affidavits. Ladies and gentlemen, do not guess or speculate as to what other evidence was produced in that trial or what other information is contained in those affidavits. It is a perfectly valid exercise to refer a witness to previous evidence or to an affidavit. May I suggest to you that you concentrate on what you have seen and heard in this Court because here you saw all of the witnesses, heard all of the questions and all of the answers and here you saw the way witnesses answered. You saw their demeanour and you had an opportunity here to assess them”. 
       
     92 I would reject this ground of appeal.

      The Trial Judge Erred in his Directions to the Jury by: 
       
       
      ………………………… 
       
       
      (d) by commenting in an impermissible manner in relation to the nature of the charges preferred against the Appellant 
       
     93 In para 62 I have set out that part of McGuire DCJ’s summing-up which is the subject of this ground of appeal. 
     94 Quite apart from the fact that it seems to me that, in its context, there is nothing objectionable in what his Honour there said, it is to be noted that neither at the conclusion of the first part of McGuire DCJ’s summing-up, nor at the conclusion of the whole of his Honour’s summing-up, was any application made on behalf of the Appellant to have that part of the summing-up withdrawn, or to have any further direction in relation to it given to the jury. This being so, I would reject this ground of appeal. 
      
       
      Ground 1 
       
       
      Pursuant to s 78G (sic) of the  
      Crimes Act 1900,  
      the “sanction” relied upon by the Respondent in prosecuting the Appellant in respect of the s 78A offences (being counts 5 to 7 on the indictment) is null and void and/or otherwise invalid 
       
     95 In paras 3 to 5 I have set out the statutory provisions relevant to this ground of appeal and in paras 6 and 7 I have set out the Order upon which the Director of Public Prosecutions relied, and the form of the sanction which he executed prior to the commencement of these proceedings. 
     96 Although in the written submissions which were filed on the Appellant’s behalf two alternative submissions were advanced to support this ground of appeal they being: 
      
       
      (1) that an authorisation given to the Director of Public Prosecutions relating to the sanction to commence proceedings under s 78F of the  
      Crimes Act 1900  
      does not continue in force after the Attorney-General who gave it has ceased to hold office; and 
       
       
      (2) that the form of sanction executed by the Director of Public Prosecutions in this case is defective in that it lacks the necessary particularity to constitute a valid consent; 
       
       
      in the course of his oral submissions, Mr Brereton sought to develop only the first of those alternative grounds.  
       
     97 In seeking to develop his submissions on this ground, Mr Brereton relied upon the decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria in Wood v Pfeiffer ([1925] VLR 167), which decision concerned an application to review the decision of a Police Magistrate convicting the then Defendant of an offence under the Vermin and Noxious Weeds Act 1922 (Vic). Section 43(1) of that Act provided: 
      
       
       “All penalties imposed by or under this Act shall be recoverable upon the information of the Superintendent if authorised on that behalf by the Minister in writing either generally or in any particular case or upon the information of any other person so authorised”. 
       
     98 In that case the informant possessed and tendered a General Authority to Prosecute dated 14 March 1924, signed by the Minister for Lands at that date who, however, had, by the time the information was laid, ceased to hold office as such. In what can only have been described as an extraordinarily brief judgment, Irvine CJ said ((supra) at 169): 
      
       
       “Mr Lewers, for the Crown, argued that the form of the Authority given to the Inspector, being general, the Authority continued after Mr Allen ceased to be Minister for Lands. We think that argument cannot be upheld. It would be against the proper construction to be given to sec. 43 to assume that any such Authority would continue after the Minister resigned”. 
       
     99 The decision in Wood v Pfeiffer was distinguished by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria in Benwell v Gottwald ([1978] VR 253) a decision concerned, not with an authority to prosecute, but with an authority to operate a breath analysing instrument. In the judgment (Crockett J, with whom Starke and Gray JJ agreed) the following appears ((supra) at 254-256): 
      
       
       “Before us it has correctly been pointed out that the only feasibly possible construction that can be placed upon the words ‘authorised in that behalf by the Chief Commissioner of Police’ are, either that the words mean the Chief Commissioner at the time of the test having been taken by the person purportedly authorised (a construction for which the defendant contended in the Court below), or that ‘Chief Commissioner’ means the Chief Commissioner at the time that the authority was given. Of course it is the latter construction for which counsel appearing on behalf of the informant before us contended. 
       
       
       In my view the latter construction is the only reasonable and sensible one which the words used can permissibly bear. There are a number of indications as to why this is so.

       The authorities that bear on a similar question appear with one exception to support that construction of the legislation. In  
       Seaton v Chen Fong 
         
       Yan 
       , [1908] QSR 195 the Full Court adopted a construction of a section where a similar point arose for consideration that is confirmatory of the view which I have expressed. And in  
       Dore v Gormley 
       , [1963] QWN 38 Gibbs J, who was then a member of the Supreme Court of Queensland, expressed himself as concurring in that view. Then again, in  
       Larcher v 
         
       Dunleavy (No 2 
       ) (1938), AR (NSW) 548 the Full Industrial Court in upholding a decision of Ferguson J expressed a like view for reasons not dissimilar from those which commend themselves to me. The only authority (the existence of which was responsible for the order nisi’s being returnable before this Court) to which we have been referred and which would suggest that the view which prevailed in the Court below might be correct is a decision of this Court in  
       Wood v Pfeiffer 
       , [1925] VLR 167. However, having examined the report of the case, I am persuaded that the Court was there dealing with a different section and a different Act, and, in consequence, it can afford no binding authority as to the correct interpretation of the section which now falls for construction. In any event, it appears that the view which was expressed by the Court in this connection was clearly obiter and apparently expressed without argument having been heard upon the matter. 
       
       
       In consequence I should not be disposed to accept the opinion referred to in that case as governing the decision that is for determination in the present motion”. 
       
     100 To the authorities referred to by Crockett J in his judgment in Benwell v Gottwald might be added the decision of Neaves J in Kelly v Watson ((1985) 10 FCR 305) and of the Full Court of the Federal Court (Morling, Jenkinson and Heerey JJ) in Aban v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs ((1991) 31 FCR 93) – a decision relating to an instrument of delegation by a Minister who had thereafter ceased to hold office – each of which decisions was to the effect that an instrument of delegation would continue to have a valid operation after the delegator ceased to hold office.  
     101 I would therefore reject this ground of appeal. 
      
       
      Grounds 2, 5, 6, 7, 8(c) (e), 11 
       
     102 Given that Mr Brereton did not seek to develop these grounds of appeal, I do not consider that anything more is called for than for me to indicate that I would reject each one of them. 
      
       
      Orders 
       
     103 For the reasons which I have recorded above, I would propose that the appeal be dismissed. 
      
       
     104 SULLY J: I agree with Powell JA. 
     105 BELL JA: I agree with Powell JA.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Mariya Teraguchi has been charged with the murder on 24 July 2001 at Yagoona of her mother, Ryoko Teraguchi. The Crown case is that the accused left Rozelle psychiatric hospital, where she was a mental patient, went to the house of her parents and stabbed her mother to death. 
     
      
    2 The question of the unfitness of the accused to be tried was raised and the Solicitor General, by virtue of the power conferred upon him as delegate of the Attorney General, determined on 22 November 2001 that there should be an enquiry whether the accused were fit or unfit to be tried for the murder. 
     
      
    3 The legislation provides for the trial of such issues by jury, but the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 provides also for the accused to elect for trial by judge alone. On 3 December 2001 the accused signed an election for trial by judge alone.  
     
      
    4 Where an accused person who makes such an election suffers from a mental illness, as this accused does, the Court must be careful to ensure that the accused made an informed election and had the capacity so to elect. The Court has received evidence from Ms Dianne Tipper, a solicitor with the Legal Aid Commission of New South Wales who has long experience in acting for persons experiencing mental impairment, including those suffering from psychiatric disorders, intellectual disability and the like. Some few days before the election was made Ms Tipper interviewed the accused and had the assistance of an interpreter in the Japanese language. Ms Tipper swore an affidavit on 5 December 2001 and, having read it, I am satisfied that the accused was fully informed before making her election about the nature of the enquiry into her fitness to be tried and about the respective parts played by the several participants. 
     
      
    5 The Court has received reports written by Dr. Boettcher, Dr. Nielssen and Dr. Westmore, psychiatrists. Dr. Boettcher at present has the care of the accused. Notwithstanding their universal opinion that the accused is suffering from a serious mental illness, they agree that when she made her election for trial by judge alone the accused had the mental capacity to do so.  
     
      
    6 Accordingly, it is appropriate that the trial into the question of the accused’s fitness to be tried be held before a judge alone. 
     
      
    7 This matter has been able to be dealt with in a shortened form because the evidence about the issues to be tried is all one way. 
     
      
    8 In order that an accused person may receive a fair trial, there are certain minimum standards with which he or she must comply. Those standards are based on a well known explanation given by Alderson B in R v Pritchard (1836) 7 Car. & P. at 304 as elaborated by Smith J in R v Presser [1958] VR 45. They require the ability to understand the nature of the charge, to plead to the charge and to exercise the right of challenge of jurors, to understand the nature of the proceedings, namely, that it is an enquiry as to whether the accused committed the offence charged, to follow the course of the proceedings, to understand the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given in support of the prosecution and to make a defence or answer to the charge. 
     
      
    9 The deceased, the accused, the accused’s younger brother and the father of the children, Mr James Hill, formerly lived in Japan. They came to Australia several years ago and settled here permanently. At the time that the deceased died, she and Mr Hill were living together in a house at Yagoona.  
     
      
    10 The accused was born on 3 August 1974. During her time in Japan she used illegal drugs and exhibited signs of mental illness. 
     
      
    11 After arriving in Australia she lived at first with her parents. She continued to use illegal drugs. In 1994 she was admitted to Banks House, the psychiatric department at Bankstown hospital. She had threatened both parents with a knife and was diagnosed as having had an acute psychotic episode. She was treated and released. During the following year she was again admitted to Banks House. The diagnosis was schizophrenia. She believed that her parents were impostors and that her mother was trying to poison her. 
     
      
    12 During 1998 she was twice more admitted to Banks House.  
     
      
    13 During these times the accused had been living in a flat provided for her by her parents, but was not coping well, and in 2000, after an initial temporary stay at Rozelle hospital, she became an inpatient there. The ward in which she was housed was not secure and she left the hospital on occasions. The Crown case is that on the day in question she took a taxi to her parents’ house. In the kitchen of the house she had an argument with her mother, took a knife and stabbed her many times.  
     
      
    14 Dr. Boettcher diagnoses the accused as suffering from a dangerous variant of chronic paranoid schizophrenia known as Capgras syndrome. The manifestation of the syndrome is the accused’s unshakable belief that the person she encountered in her parents’ house was not her mother but an impostor who, having undergone plastic surgery in order to look like her mother, took her place. The accused believes that her mother is in Japan. According to Dr. Boettcher, the illness is now of long standing. He believes that the accused is unlikely to respond in future to treatment and that she will retain her delusional thought disorder and general paranoid ideation indefinitely.  
     
      
    15 Dr. Boettcher thinks that the accused is not fit for trial. Although she understands the charge which has been brought against her, she believes that it was someone other that her mother whom she killed. She would have trouble working out that she has the right to challenge members of the jury panel and would be inclined to rely on voices in her head which she describes as “astro-travellers”. She would find it hard to understand the nature of the proceedings in a trial because of comments she perceived as coming from the “astro-travellers”. Those voices and paranoid ideas would cause her quickly to lose track of the progress of court proceedings. She has a strong inclination to dismiss important issues and might not be prepared to take seriously evidence given against her. She would be unable rationally to decide what defence to rely on because of clouding of thought processes. She would have trouble conveying to her legal representatives her version of events.  
     
      
    16 Dr. Nielssen agrees that the accused would be unable to follow proceedings and give instructions unaffected by her fixed delusional beliefs. Dr. Westmore observed that the accused has a significantly impaired understanding of the issues canvassed in R v Presser and would be unable to provide her solicitor with instructions during the course of any protracted legal proceedings. She would be unable to follow much of the proceedings. She would be unable to understand that she could enter a mental illness defence or what such a defence would mean.  
     
      
    17 In view of the unanimous opinion of the three psychiatrists the only conclusion to which the Court can come is that the accused is unfit to be tried. 
     
      
    18 The scheme of the legislation which covers enquiries of this kind requires the Court when a person is found unfit to be tried to refer that person to the Mental Health Review Tribunal. It also provides for the making of other incidental orders but I think that none arises in the present case. 
     
      
    19 The duty of the Mental Health Review Tribunal when a matter has been referred to it following a finding of unfitness is to review the case of that person and report to the Court in due course. The most important thing that the Tribunal does is to decide whether in its opinion the person will become fit to be tried within twelve months. If that is the ultimate view of the Tribunal, it reports that fact to the Court and a further enquiry is held into the question whether the accused is unfit to be tried and if the result is that the accused is not unfit, that is fit to be tried, a trial might be expected to follow. 
     
      
    20 If in the view of the Mental Health Review Tribunal, however, the accused is unlikely to be fit to be tried within twelve months, a special hearing may be held. At such a hearing the accused may be acquitted, though not convicted. The accused may raise any defence which could properly be raised if the hearing were a trial, including the defence that he or she is not guilty because of mental illness. If the accused is found on the limited evidence available to have committed the offence, then the duty of the Court is to impose a limiting term which is in effect a statement of the sentence it would have imposed if the accused had been convicted of the offence charged. 
     
      
    21 Those matters must await the future and the only thing that the Court is required now to do is to refer the matter to the Mental Health Review Tribunal to be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    22 I find the accused unfit to be tried by reason of mental illness. She is remanded in custody pending a determination by the Mental Health Review Tribunal under s 16 Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act.

      REGINA v. Peter Frederick CLARK 
       
      Judgment 
     1 HODGSON JA: On 18 April 2001 the appellant was indicted before Dowd J on a charge under s.319 of the Crimes Act 1900, that he, on 23 February 2000, at Taree in the State of New South Wales did an act, namely speak to a judicial officer, Christie DCJ, making adverse comments to him with intent to pervert the course of justice. 
      
       
     2 The appellant pleaded not guilty and was tried before Dowd J and a jury of twelve. On 24 April 2001 the jury returned a verdict of guilty, and on 25 June 2001 the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for twelve months by way of periodic detention, to commence on 13 July 2001.  
      
       
     3 The appellant has appealed from that conviction. The relevant sections of the Crimes Act are ss.319 and 312 which are as follows:  
      
       
        
         
         319. A person who does any act, or makes any omission, intending in any way to pervert the course of justice, is liable to imprisonment for 14 years.  
         
        
        
         
         312. A reference in this Part to perverting the course of justice is a reference to obstructing, preventing, perverting or defeating the course of justice or the administration of the law. 
         
        
       
     4 The following circumstances giving rise to the charge are not in dispute.  
      
       
     5 The appellant had an appeal matter before the Taree District Court, and on 21 February 2000 the appellant, who was unrepresented on this appeal, made an application to Christie DCJ that witnesses be called in his appeal, and that application was refused. The appellant's appeal was set down for hearing on 2 March 2000.  
      
       
     6 On 23 February 2000 the matter again came before Christie DCJ for mention in relation to subpoenas served on various persons. After discussion in relation to the subpoenas the following exchange occurred  
      
       
        
         
         CLARK: There's one other thing, your Honour. 
          
         HIS HONOUR: I'm sure there would be. Why does that not surprise me? 
          
         CLARK: Could Mr Allison and I approach you because I don't want to mention it in open Court. 
          
         HIS HONOUR: You've got me bluffed now. Do you know what he's talking about, Mr Crown? 
          
         ALLISON: I don't, your Honour. 
          
         HIS HONOUR: All right. Well if you mention to Mr Crown when I leave the bench what it is you want to discuss I might see you both in chambers briefly, if it's something delicate, is it? 
          
         CLARK: It is very delicate, your Worship. I don't know whether I should mention it or not but I think I should because it concerns you, sir. 
         
        
       
     7 Thereafter, Christie DCJ went to his Chambers with his Associate, and the appellant then came to the Judge's Chambers, together with the solicitor from the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. A court attendant was at the open doorway to the Chambers. Conversation then occurred which, according to a written statement made by Christie DCJ shortly afterwards, went substantially as follows:  
      
       
        
         
         13. Mr CLARK said words to me paraphrased as follows: 
          
         ""During the last sittings when you were here, Constable SMOOTHY had a conversation with me and told me something about you; I have been told by Constable SMOOTHY that you are a corrupt judge and that you take bribes."" 
          
         I said, ""How much are you offering Mr Clark” 
          
         He said, ""Nothing, your Honour.  
          
          
         14. He also said, ""I've also been told that you, er, your wife, owns or runs a hotel in Sydney which has been used by your wife to launder money for organised crime syndicates.  
          
          
         15. I thanked him for letting me have that information and told him that I would take it on board. I said, ""I don't think it's got anything to do with your appeal one way or the other"". 
          
         He then said whilst proffering his hand, 
          
         ""Is it O.K. if I shake a Judge's hand?"" 
          
         I said, ""I think it is best not to do so.”  
         
        
       
     8 This statement was tendered in evidence at the trial by the appellant, and there was no significant dispute about its accuracy. The statement went on to record the following opinion about the appellant's purpose in saying what he said: 
      
       
        
         
         18. I formed the immediate view that Mr CLARK wished to achieve one of several possible purposes: 
          
         (a) That I would believe that Constable SMOOTHY had actually made the allegations to Mr. CLARK and I would thereby be heavily prejudiced against any evidence that SMOOTHY might offer. 
          
         (b) That I would disbelieve that SMOOTHY had said anything of the sort and would be thereby so prejudiced against the appellant CLARK, that I would have to disqualify myself from hearing his appeal and possibly that of his son and adjourn them to the next sittings.  
         
        
        
       Christie DCJ did then disqualify himself from hearing the appellant's appeal and that appeal then went over to be heard by another Judge. 
        
       
     9 At the trial before Dowd J the Crown Prosecutor explained the Crown case in the following way in opening to the jury: 
      
       
        
         
         So what the Crown says in this case is the representations that were made, or the statements made by Mr Clark to the Judge about him being corrupt and taking bribes and his wife laundering money, were quite deliberate and calculated lies, false statements, to place the Judge in a difficult position. Here was a case where one party was making allegations and falsely attributing those allegations to a party in the case he had to decide, a party who was on the other side of the slate to Mr Clark. 
          
          
         In this case the Judge considered his position, came back on to the bench and decided because of what had transpired he could not deal with the matter impartially and disqualified himself from hearing the matter and adjourned the matter to a future date. What happened to that matter or what happened to Mr Clark's appeal is not a matter you will hear evidence of in the prosecution case because it is not relevant at all. 
          
          
         The Crown says that those false statements Mr Clark attributed to Senior Constable Smoothy were made in the context of Judge Christie having turned down his application to have the witnesses called and were done in the context when he well knew that the Judge could not continue to hear the matter. That is the ultimate that happened. The Judge disqualified himself, put it over to a future sittings before some other Judge. 
          
          
         The charge the Crown brings against Mr Clark is that he did an act with intent to pervert the course of justice, the act being making these false statements to Judge Christie about his involvement in corruption and his wife being involved in the laundering of money.  
         
        
       
     10 The appellant, who was unrepresented at the trial, was also given an opportunity to open his case before the jury. The substance of the appellant's case was put in the following way in his opening: 
      
       
        
         
         Judge Christie who is involved in this matter, Judge Christie and I got on really good and I believed in him and I thought: yeah, I'll get a fair trial. Then I got this information from Smoothy and I thought: do I tell Judge Christie in open court, ""Senior Constable Smoothy has told me that you are corrupt and you accept bribes."" - do I tell him in open court or do I tell him like you see on the TV. My experience is from watching programmes like The Practice. Do you tell him in chambers and I thought the best thing was to tell him so in future if he hears these allegations he can question Constable Smoothy. That was all my intention was and Judge Christie took that all on board and it was done back in chambers. I said: I insist the Crown is with me when I present this now in chambers. I said, ""Can I have Mr Allison?"" - I wanted him there. I didn't want it broadcast in open court that I had heard these rumours. 
          
          
         That is simply all it comes down to, the reasoning behind all this. From hearing the evidence it is ridiculous. We were getting on really well. All those witnesses will point out is that it is clear from the transcript the Judge is joking with me.  
          
         ... 
          
          
         You will hear evidence which will be basically all fact. There is no contest with that. It is all straight forward. What you have to decide is what is the motive. There are no motives, except simply I was telling somebody I heard these rumours. The only way to stop rumours is to nip them in the bud by saying: I have heard this person saying something. This bloke is saying this about you, to nip it in the bud before it escalates. I don't want rumours floating around about me, that's why I discreetly mentioned this to the Judge in chambers but the police jumped on this to try and prevent me and break me before I can get my statement of claim against the corrupt policeman and the DPP in court. 
         
        
       
     11 In the prosecution case, Senior Constable Smoothy gave evidence that he did not say anything to the appellant of the nature of the allegation made by the appellant to Christie DCJ. The appellant, in cross-examination, put to Senior Constable Smoothy that he had said these things to the appellant, and this was denied by Senior Constable Smoothy. However, in the course of cross-examination Senior Constable Smoothy went a little further, and said words to the effect that there was no conversation with the appellant about Judge Christie.  
      
       
     12 The appellant did not give evidence before the jury. However, he called as witnesses his two daughters. One of them gave evidence that she saw the appellant talking to Senior Constable Smoothy outside the Taree courthouse, and that she heard the Constable say, in the course of conversation, the words ""Judge Christie"", and that this attracted her attention because her own name was Kristie. 
      
       
     13 In final addresses, the prosecution made this submission in relation to intent: 
      
       
        
         
         The Crown says that this was quite deliberate conduct by Mr Clark. Smoothy has denied that he ever said these things to Mr Clark. That is the only evidence in relation to any such conversation, apart from Ms Kristie Clark this morning hearing some reference to a judge, Judge Christie. There is no suggestion she heard any conversation about a corrupt judge or bribes or hotels or anything like laundering money. The evidence from that comes from only one person, from Senior Constable Smoothy and he denies saying anything of the kind. He denies that he knew anything about the judge's family life or anything of the kind.  
          
          
         So the Crown in this case says that those comments by Mr Clark in the judge's chambers were uttered by him with a particular intent, that is, to raise these false allegations to place the judge in an untenable position where he could not proceed to hear the case. This was in a context where this judge had already made a preliminary ruling refusing Mr Clark's initial application to call additional witnesses. That is the allegation the Crown relies upon. 
          
          
         His Honour will tell you about the elements that go to make up this charge. The fact that the judge ultimately disqualified himself is simply evidence to place the matter in context. The real issue in this case you might think is what was Mr Clark's intent at the time. I reiterate that you decide this case on the evidence, the eight witnesses you have heard and the nine exhibits. That is the totality of the evidence in this case. 
         
        
       
     14 The appellant, in his final address, made these submissions: 
      
       
        
         
         The discussion in chambers with Judge Christie was like you see on the tv; Perry Mason, Law and Order. You say something here - let's go into chambers, and that is exactly what happened on that day. Not in open court. Right? And the evidence there is I didn't want to broadcast, ""Hey, I have been told you are a corrupt judge, Judge Christie"". I don't want to broadcast that out there. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: What you did or didn't want to - - 
          
          
         ACCUSED: I apologise, but the evidence speaks to that. Right. I wanted it mentioned in chambers, not in open court, right? That is most important. Where does he - if you are told something, and it is serious about somebody else, did you keep it to yourself or if the person you think, you respect that person, do you ask to talk to them discreetly in the presence of the Prosecutor, right? So there can be no misconceptions or anything, you discuss it in chambers with the Prosecutor there, and the Prosecutor, if I had asked to see the judge without the Prosecutor, then there could be reasons there, but because I specifically said with Mr Allison present, the Police prosecutor - well, the DPP. 
          
          
         It is very important you look at those things. I think a normal person would look at those things and think Mr Clark is trying to do the right thing. He is trying to get a fair trial. I left school when I was 15. 
         
        
       
     15 In his summing up to the jury, the trial judge explained the offence in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         The offence itself is defined in the Crimes Act 1900, so the meaning of 'Pervert the Course of Justice' can be, and I will give you all of the possibilities - a reference to obstructing, preventing, perverting or defeating the course of justice or the administration of the law. So the full definition is 'obstructing, preventing, perverting or defeating the course of justice or the administration of the law'. That is the definition of 'Pervert the Course of Justice'. 
         
        
       
     16 In relation to intent, the trial judge gave the following directions:  
      
       
        
         
         36 The second element of the offence is that he did it with intent in any way to pervert the course of justice. I have told you about pervert the course of justice. So what you have to determine here is the intent of the accused. Now, proof of an intent to do an act where an act has an obvious or manifest tendency to pervert the course of justice may be readily inferred. 
          
          
         37 The Crown case is that the statement made to the judge about what Sen. Const. Smoothy said is such as would cause the judge inevitably to disqualify himself. Now, whether or not the statement was made by Sen. Const. Smoothy, is not relevant to this offence. You have heard evidence from Constable Smoothy unchallenged that he did not say what he is alleged to have said but whether or not he said it is not an element of the offence. The offence is the act of the accused in relation to what Sen. Const. Smoothy is supposed to have said to the judge. 
         
        
       
     17 Subsequently in the summing up the trial judge said: ""It does not matter what Senior Constable Smoothy said"". He went on to say this: 
      
       
        
         
         The issue that that leaves is what was the accused's intent, and, remember the evidence is that the utterances were false and, as I have said, it does not matter whether or not they were false - there is no challenge to that evidence - that it was deliberate in placing the Judge in the position that he was whereas, inevitably, as you have heard, he had to disqualify. 
         
        
       
     18 At the request of the appellant, the trial judge subsequently corrected the statement that there was no challenge to Senior Constable Smoothy's evidence that he had not said the matters reported by the appellant, and the trial judge reminded the jury that the appellant did challenge Senior Constable Smoothy's evidence in cross-examination. 
      
       
     19 This appeal is brought on the following grounds. 
      
       
     20 One, at the trial the appellant said he would like to have a barrister, but was intimidated by the trial judge and the trial proceeded with the appellant unrepresented.  
      
       
     21 Two, the appellant requested that all Crown witnesses be in attendance to give evidence in chief.  
      
       
     22 Three, the appellant called on a subpoena to give evidence served on Sergeant Griffith, but his attendance was not obtained.  
      
       
     23 Four, the appellant raised a question of conflict of interest between the trial judge and Christie DCJ.  
      
       
     24 Five, the appellant alleged that the trial judge “nodded off” whilst the accused was cross-examining the DPP solicitor.  
      
       
     25 Six, in relation to Senior Constable Smoothy's evidence, questions were wrongly disallowed and there were errors in the summing up.  
      
       
     26 Seven, as regards sentence, the appellant was unable to get a report from Dr Westmore.  
      
       
     27 Eight, the trial judge failed to give directions to the jury concerning possible mental illness of the appellant. 
      
       
     28 I believe there is no substance in any of the grounds, except ground 6. Since I believe that the appeal should be allowed on ground 6, I need not review the other grounds in detail.  
      
       
     29 The appellant's case, as outlined in his opening, was that he believed at the time the right thing to do was to bring to Christie DCJ's attention allegations that had been made against him. This case was clearly raised in the appellant's opening and, to some extent, although less clearly, put in his final address. This case involved the proposition that Senior Constable Smoothy had made the allegations against Christie DCJ, but not any suggestion that the allegations themselves were or might be true. 
      
       
     30 In his cross-examination of Christie DCJ, the appellant sought to make out the proposition that he was getting on well with Christie DCJ and so would not want him disqualified. The appellant did not himself give evidence that his belief and intention were as he put in his opening address, but the onus of proof lay on the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt intention to pervert the course of justice, and what the appellant raised was a hypothesis that could possibly negative that intention. It may be that the hypothesis was not a very plausible one, but nevertheless, it was a hypothesis that had to be negatived beyond reasonable doubt. 
      
       
     31 In my opinion, the truth or otherwise of what the appellant said to Christie DCJ about what Senior Constable Smoothy had said, although not an element of the offence, was of central relevance to the appellant’s defence. If it was untrue, then that would be a very powerful consideration in favour of finding the intent alleged by the prosecution. However, if the jury thought that what the appellant had said to Christie DCJ about Senior Constable Smoothy might be true, there was a reasonable possibility that they might not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had the intention to pervert the course of justice. The trial judge, in his summing up, not only said that the truth or otherwise of what the appellant said was irrelevant, but also did not put to the jury the substance of the appellant's defence, to which I have adverted. 
      
       
     32 For the Crown, it is put that there is no evidence that what the appellant said about Senior Constable Smoothy was true. In my opinion, that is not correct. The representation made by the appellant to Christie DCJ was admissible as some evidence of its truth (see Evidence Act 1995 s.60) and was also some evidence that the appellant believed it to be true (Evidence Act s.72). Furthermore, the evidence of the appellant's daughter was capable of being considered evidence contradicting an important aspect of Senior Constable Smoothy's evidence. So in that sense, it is not wholly correct to say that Senior Constable Smoothy's evidence was uncontradicted at the trial. 
      
       
     33 For these reasons, I think there were errors in the summing up concerning the evidence of Senior Constable Smoothy. I think also that these errors may well have affected the result of the trial and that, accordingly, the appeal should be upheld. 
      
       
     34 The question arises whether a new trial should be ordered pursuant to s.8(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The Court has a wide discretion whether or not to make such an order: see King v R (1986) 161 CLR 423. 
      
       
     35 Mr Rowling for the Crown has submitted that the interests of justice do require that there be a new trial. He submitted that the case was one which could very well succeed on a new trial. The offence was a serious one, striking at the administration of justice, and involved the publication of very serious allegations against a judge and his wife. The sentence imposed was a light one, and only 23 weeks had been served of the 12 month sentence.  
      
       
     36 I accept that the offence of attempting to pervert the course of justice is a serious one. However, in the particular circumstances of this case, having regard to the fact that what was done was done openly, and having regard to the fact that nearly half of the sentence has been served, on the whole, I am not persuaded that the interests of justice require that there be a further trial. 
      
       
     37 In my opinion, the appropriate orders are that the appeal be upheld, that the conviction be quashed and that a verdict of acquittal be entered. 
      
       
     38 LEVINE J:  I agree. 
      
       
     39 HOWIE J: I also agree. 
      
       
     40 HODGSON JA: So those are the orders of the Court.

       JUDGMENT 
        
         
       
     1   HIDDEN J: I agree with Newman AJ. 
     2   NEWMAN AJ: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentences of imprisonment passed upon the applicant by Ducker DCJ at Lismore Court on 23 April 2001. 
     3   The applicant had pleaded guilty before the Local Court on 28 November 2000 to six counts of indecent assault pursuant to the then extant s76 of the Crimes Act 1900. He maintained his plea before the learned District Court judge. Section 76 of the Crimes Act as it stood at the time of the commission of the offences provided for a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment for the offence of indecent assault. Section 76 has been repealed for many years and has been replaced by a comprehensive legislative scheme dealing with sexual offences. However, as I have said, at the time of the commission of the offences s76 represented the law. Accordingly, there was no issue in this application that his Honour was correct in applying s76 to the facts of this case when sentencing. 
     4   The six counts of indecent assault related to events which took place between 8 December 1960 and 11 March 1964. 
     5   In the event his Honour imposed a sentence constructed as follows: 
      
       
        
        As to counts six and one his Honour imposed a term of imprisonment for 15 months commencing on 23 April 2001 and expiring on 22 July 2002. On those counts he imposed a non-parole period of seven months commencing on 23 April 2001 and expiring on 22 November 2001. 
        
       
       
        
        On count three he imposed a term of imprisonment of two years to commence on 22 November 2001 and to expire on 21 November 2003. This instance he imposed a non-parole period of 12 months commencing on 22 November 2001 and expiring on 21 November 2002. 
        
       
       
        
        For counts two, four and five of the indictment his Honour imposed a term of imprisonment of 15 months commencing on 21 November 2001 and expiring on 20 February 2003. Here he imposed a non-parole period of seven months commencing on 21 November 2001 and expiring on 20 June 2002. His Honour directed that the applicant be released to parole on 21 November 2002 and that the parole order was to contain the usual conditions. 
        
       
     6   The offences involved the two natural daughters of the applicant. The elder, SMR, was born on 14 August 1955 and the younger daughter, HMR, was born on 8 December 1956. At the time of the commission of the offences the two children were resident with the applicant and his wife. His Honour in dealing with the offences quite properly in my view concluded that the events surrounding the second count was the first of the offences committed and that in chronological order these offences were followed by the offences which were the subject of counts six, one, three, four and five of the indictment. 
     7   The facts involved in count two were as follows. The offence took place between 1 January 1961 and 13 August 1962 involving the elder child, SMR. There the applicant took SMR to his parents home and while there SMR was standing in the lounge room of the house. The applicant approached her and commenced to rub his hands through her hair and stroke her softly on the face. He then ran his hands down the front of her dress, under her dress and into her underpants. He then commenced to rub her on the outside of her genitalia in the general vicinity of her vagina with his left hand. This continued for something like two minutes, after which he gave her a cuddle and walked out to where the rest of the family were to be found. 
     8   The sixth count which his Honour found to have been the second committed in point of time occurred between 8 December 1960 and 8 February 1961 and involved the child, HMR, who would have then been approximately five years of age.  
     9   Between those two dates the offence occurred in the front room of the house in which the applicant and his family were then living. HMR and her two brothers were running around the front room of the house naked. The applicant took hold of HMR and lifted her onto a tallboy. He then pushed backwards and rubbed her vagina for a few minutes before stopping. The events relating to count one his Honour found occurred between 1 January 1961 and 13 August 1961. The events took place at the family home. There HMR and SMR were playing in a bedroom. The applicant entered the room and having locked the door behind himself continued to chase the children around the room as though he were taking part in some form of game. Eventually he caught up with SMR and commenced to rub her vagina. Initially he rubbed the outside of her underpants but later he slipped his hand beneath her underpants and started rubbing inside her pants in the region of her vagina. After doing this for some time he left the room. 
     10   The events relating to counts three and four occurred between 13 August and 25 December 1963. Again the events occurred in the family home. SMR was playing in a room when the applicant walked in and told her to take her pants off. She lay across a bed with her head up against a wall after she did so. The applicant then undid the zip of his trousers, took out his penis which apparently was flaccid and commenced rubbing up and down and around her vaginal area. During the course of doing this his penis became erect. SMR was approximately eight years of age at the time. 
     11   While this was happening HMR entered the room. The applicant said to her ‘we’re playing the game and you have to join in’. HMR turned to leave but was taken hold of by the applicant who after closing the bedroom door pulled her underpants down and commenced to rub her vagina. Both SMR and HMR were lying side by side at one stage with the applicant rubbing their vaginas simultaneously. This continued for a short time and ended when the applicant stood up, zipped up his fly and left the room. The sixth offence which was represented by count five on the indictment involved SMR at a time between 11 January and 11 March 1964. Again it occurred at the family home. Both SMR and HMR were lying on their backs across a bed and had their underpants pushed down while the applicant was kneeling on the floor in front of them. He then commenced to rub the vaginal area of SMR (who appears to have been about nine years of age at the time). After performing this act for a short time the applicant stood up and walked out of the room. 
     12   Objectively, as his Honour found, these facts constitute very serious breaches of the criminal law. As his Honour found having committed the first of these offences the applicant continued to carry out a systematic course of deliberate criminal behaviour over an extended period. The fact that the applicant was the father of his victims underscores the seriousness of the offences. Both his daughters were entitled to look to him for support and protection. His actions involved a derogation of his paternal duties. Again, as his Honour rightly pointed out, had the offences come to light within a reasonable time of their commission there is no doubt that the applicant would have faced a certain prospect of a lengthy period of imprisonment even if he had pleaded guilty as he did before his Honour and avoided the necessity for SMR and HMR to give evidence. Again, as his Honour pointed out, the fact that the applicant had no other convictions should not have enabled him to avoid a lengthy sentence of imprisonment if the events had come to light soon after their commission. 
     13   In his written submissions senior counsel for the applicant identified the following matters as constituting error on his Honour’s part: 
     (1) In all the circumstances the sentence was unduly harsh and severe. 
      
       
        
          
        
       
     (2) The sentencing judge erred in :- 
      
       
        
          
        
       
     (a) ordering that the appellant serve a full time custodial sentence; and  
      
       
        
         
          
            
          
         
        
       
     (b) ordering that the sentences be served cumulatively. 
     (3) The sentencing judge erred in finding that there had been no recurrence of offences for 35 years “partly.. because of lack of opportunity within his own family and possibly because of the inevitable diminution of his sex drive.” 
     (4) The sentencing judge erred in :- 
     (a) Failing to give adequate weight to the contrition of the appellant expressed in 1993 and thereafter. 
      
       
        
         
          
            
          
         
        
       
     (b) Failing to give any weight to the appellant’s prior good character. 
      
       
        
         
          
            
          
         
        
       
     (c) Failing to give sufficient or adequate weight to the appellant’s pleas on either a utilitarian basis or the saving of the complainants’ having to give evidence. 
      
       
        
         
          
            
          
         
        
       
     (d) Failing to give adequate weight to the long delay and staleness of the offences. 
      
       
        
         
          
            
          
         
        
       
     (e) Failing to give adequate weight to the effect of a full time custodial sentence on the appellant at his age of 62. 
     14   In his oral submissions senior counsel for the applicant was critical of a finding made by his Honour which was in the following terms: 
      
       
        
        ‘The passage of time has worked in his favour in this sense that he has proved by his actual behaviour that it is highly unlikely that there will be any recurrence of offences of this type. He has done this partly, it must be recognised, because of lack of opportunity within his own family and possibly because of the inevitable diminution of his sex drive.’ 
        
       
     15   It was submitted that to make such a finding his Honour must have used material contained in the victims’ impact statements of SMR and HMR which were tendered. It was put that such a use of the material contained in such statements is improper. The purpose of the tender of such material is to assist the court to gauge the impact of the events in question upon the victims not to use the material in order to make adverse findings of fact relating to motivation on the part of an accused person. I do not accept that his Honour did in fact come to the conclusions he did in the paragraph quoted because he improperly used material to be found in the victims’ impact statements. It is obvious that the older his daughters became his opportunity to commit offences of a like type would have diminished. Second, his Honour’s observation as to the inevitable diminution of the applicant’s sex drive is an observation, I have no doubt, drawn from his Honour’s knowledge of human behaviour.  
     16   In his Honour’s remarks on sentence he dealt at length with the question of the applicant’s contrition, his prior good character, the affect of him pleading guilty, the length of time between the commission of the offences and the fact that to sentence a man of his years - he was 62 at the time of sentence - to a full time custodial sentence would create hardship. In my view his Honour dealt with the subjective elements relating to the applicant in an appropriate and proper manner. 
     17   I should add that the prime reason for this court reserving its judgment in the matter was the fact of the question of to what extent the sentencing judge should take into account the sentencing attitudes at the time when old offences such as these were committed. This question is currently the subject of a reserved judgment of a five person bench of this court (R v MJR). In this instance his Honour did in fact take into account sentencing attitudes at the time near to the commission of these offences. In so doing he did so to the applicant’s advantage. Accordingly, I do not believe it necessary for this court to wait the decision of the five person bench in order to determine this appeal. 
     18   I should also observe that even if his Honour did err in finding as he did that there had been no recurrence of the offences for 35 years ‘partly because of lack of opportunity within his own family and possibly because of the inevitable diminution of his sex drive’ this would not lead me to conclude that this court should interfere and re-sentence. I say this because of the provisions of s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act. Pursuant to that section this court must form a positive opinion that ‘some other sentence … is warranted in law and should have been passed’. In Regina v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534 at para 79 Spigelman CJ observed as follows: 
      
       
        
        ‘Sentencing appeals in this Court frequently proceed as if the statutory trigger for the quashing of a sentence were expressed as follows: “If it is of the opinion that error has occurred in the sentencing process.” That is not the statutory formulation. By s6(3) this Court must form a positive opinion that “some other sentence … is warranted in law and should have been passed”. Unless such an opinion is formed, the essential pre-condition for the exercise of the power to “quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefore” is not satisfied. As the judgments in Dinsdale  
        (202 CLR 321) 
         to which I have referred indicate, the exercise of the power in s6(3) further requires the identification of error in the requisite sense.’ 
        
       
     19   In my view having regard to the systematic course of sexual assaults carried out by the applicant upon his daughters over a period of over three years that an accumulated term of imprisonment of two years and seven months with a non-parole period of one year and seven months does not lead me to the conclusion ‘that some other sentence … is warranted in law and should have been passed’, ie, some lesser sentence than that imposed by his Honour. In short, I am of the view that this court should not interfere in this matter. 
     20   Because of the importance of the matter to the applicant I would grant leave to appeal but would dismiss the appeal.

      REGINA v Robbie Ashley KOLLAS 
       
       
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 KIRBY J:  This is an appeal by Robbie Ashley Kollas (the applicant), against a sentence imposed by Judge Hosking on 1 June 2001. Mr Kollas was charged with three offences as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         First, that on 23 December 1999 at Willoughby, he did maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm upon George Kanaan with intent to do grievous bodily harm.  
         
        
        
         
         Secondly, in the alternative, that on the same day he maliciously inflicted grievous bodily harm upon George Kanaan contrary to s39 of the Crimes Act 1900; and  
         
        
        
         
         Thirdly, that on the same day he maliciously damaged property, namely a glass door, contrary to s195 of the Crimes Act. 
         
        
       
     2 Mr Kollas pleaded not guilty to each offence. He was tried before Judge Hosking and a jury. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty on the first count. However, it found him guilty on counts 2 and 3. His Honour therefore was obliged to sentence in respect of those counts. He did so on 15 June 2001, backdating the sentence to the time Mr Kollas went into custody, 16 March 2001. His Honour imposed a term of imprisonment of three years in respect of count 2 with a non-parole period of two years expiring on 15 March 2002. On the remaining count, his Honour sentenced Mr Kollas to a fixed term of six months, concurrent with the previous term. 
      
       
        
       The Offences 
       
     3 The events giving rise to these charges occurred on 23 December 1999. Mr Kollas was driving a vehicle in Willoughby. He was accompanied by his mother and half brother, Luke Jones, who was younger. An incident occurred involving another vehicle. It was a vehicle used by the pizza shop in Willoughby Road for the delivery of pizzas. There was an exchange of abuse. The abuse was followed by what is commonly referred to as “tailgating”, that is, Mr Kollas driving uncomfortably close to the vehicle in front, the pizza shop vehicle.  
      
       
     4 That was conduct which the sentencing judge described as silly and unnecessary. Unfortunately the incident did not end there. Mr Kollas then drove his vehicle past the pizza shop on three occasions. On one such occasion he swerved towards the entrance of the shop. A number of young men, who worked at the shop, were standing on the footpath. There was an altercation. A bottle was thrown, apparently by Luke Jones. It struck one of the men. Mr Kollas got out of his vehicle. He had, according to witnesses, a club-lock, being a large metal object used to lock the steering wheel of a vehicle. Threats were made as the club-lock was brandished. Mr Kollas then got back in his vehicle and drove off. However, his purpose was not to put an end to the incident. Rather, it was to obtain reinforcements so that he might return to the pizza shop. 
      
       
     5 Mr Kollas went to the hotel where another brother, Jason Ross, and his stepfather were drinking. They and another man, who was also drinking at the hotel, then got into Mr Kollas's vehicle. Mr Kollas drove back to the pizza shop. It is plain, as the learned sentencing judge found, that he was intent upon revenge. What followed was described by the sentencing judge as ""chilling"". And so it was. Judge Hosking gave a description of what happened in these words: 
      
       
        
         
         “... the victim George Kanaan, a young man I think in his early twenties and of relatively slight build. Late in the afternoon of 23 December 1999 Mr Kanaan went to his place of part time employment, The Flying Pigs Pizza Shop in Penshurst Street at Willoughby to commence a work shift there. He was standing outside the shop minding his own business before he went inside to commence his shift. According to one witness, he was simply standing smoking a cigarette on the footpath adjacent to the front glass door of the pizza shop. Suddenly and without any warning to Mr Kanaan, the offender pulled up nearby in his old Holden sedan with three other men and a woman (who was in fact the offender's mother, Fay Hines). One of the three other men was the offender's half brother, Jason Ross. The offender and the three men with him rushed towards the front door of the pizza shop and tried to get inside to attack the occupants of the shop. The occupants closed the front door to protect themselves but unfortunately for him, Mr Kanaan was still outside and unable to get into the door before his workmates closed it. 
         
        
        
         
         The offender and his male accomplices assumed (correctly) that Mr Kanaan had some connection with the pizza shop. In a highly agitated state they turned on Mr Kanaan, striking him with their fists repeatedly until he fell to the ground. At that time the offender was armed with a club-lock, that is to say a locking device to lock a car steering wheel. One of the offender's accomplices was armed with some kind of weapon described by one witness as being like a tyre lever. Whilst on the ground Mr Kanaan was struck with the club-lock and the other weapon. In addition he was kicked to the head and body and was stomped on with considerable force, both to his head and his body. To try and protect himself, Mr Kanaan assumed a foetal position and moved his hands and his forearms from his head to his torso and back again against the rain of blows and the kicks being directed towards him. Such was the savagery and duration of the attack upon him that his attempts to protect himself were in vain. He lost consciousness.” 
         
        
       
     6 The consequences for Mr Kanaan were described by his Honour as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “When his attackers finally desisted and made off Mr Kanaan was left on the footpath, covered in blood, moaning and shaking uncontrollably as though experiencing an epileptic fit. Ambulance officers came to attend to him. In a grave condition he was taken to hospital where medical examination showed that he had significant intra-cerebral bleeding and to more than one area of his brain. He also had numerous cuts and abrasions. He suffered brain damage which may be permanent. He suffers from continuous headaches, or at least did at the date he gave evidence at the offender's trial and to that date and from the date of the attack to that date had not been able to resume either his normal work as a spray painter, nor indeed do any work at all.” 
         
        
       
     7 Mr Kollas was identified. He was later approached by the police. He acknowledged his involvement in the incident. However, he denied that he was responsible for Mr Kanaan's injuries.  
      
       
     8 The case was put to the jury by the Crown upon a number of bases. Broadly, it was suggested that either Mr Kollas had inflicted the injuries upon Mr Kanaan himself, or was part of a joint criminal enterprise, the purpose of which was to inflict such harm. His Honour was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr Kollas had struck the victim, though he may or may not have been responsible for the grievous bodily harm actually inflicted upon him. 
      
       
     9 Against this background his Honour said this: 
      
       
        
         
         “The offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm is an offence of the utmost gravity in these circumstances. This was a premeditated attack by a group upon one man who was simply minding his open business. The thirst for revenge for a perceived wrong was at such a pitch that the offender and his companions did not seem to care who was the victim of their attack.” 
         
        
       
     10 His Honour stated: 
      
       
        
         
         “People such as the offender and his companions in this pitiless attack must understand that to beat and kick someone in these circumstances so savagely and repeatedly and without mercy for an imagined slight by somebody with whom the victim was associated will bring commensurate penalties. In my view the commission of the offence of malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm is one which calls for a sentence reflecting considerations of both subjective and general deterrence.” 
         
        
        
       Subjective Circumstances 
       
     11 His Honour, in his remarks on sentence, dealt with the subjective features of the applicant's case. He was a man aged 24 years. He had a number of convictions, all relatively minor. None involved crimes of violence. Mr Kollas came from a dysfunctional family in which his stepfather was an alcoholic and violent. Mr Kollas had exhibited some behavioural problems at school. He was described as a good worker. His Honour accepted that he was, to a degree, contrite. He also accepted that there had been reprisals against him in goal from people associated with the victim's brother who was a person with a significant criminal record. As a consequence, Mr Kollas had been taken into protective custody. He was likely to remain on protection for the duration of his sentence. His Honour accepted that his sentence was likely to be more arduous by reason of that fact. It was acknowledged that Mr Kollas had not been in prison before.  
      
       
     12 His Honour found special circumstances (s44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999). He made a small adjustment to the parole period, which would otherwise apply, fixing the non-parole period as two years. 
      
       
        
       Sentencing Co-offender 
       
     13 It will be recalled from the description that I have given, that Jason Ross was one of the reinforcement that Mr Kollas obtained from the hotel. Mr Ross pleaded guilty to the offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm, being the same offence for which Mr Kollas was later sentenced. The plea was entered at an early date. Mr Ross was sentenced by his Honour Judge Herron QC on 20 April 2001. The court has been provided with Judge Herron's remarks on sentence. His Honour said this: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is confusing, to say the least, to work out exactly how it came about that the defendant happened to be there at all.” 
         
        
       
     14 His Honour later stated that Mr Jason Ross was there bent upon revenge for what he believed to have been an assault upon one of his friends. His Honour's remarks gave no indication that he was apprised of the precise sequence before the assault, as revealed by the evidence before Judge Hosking at the applicant's trial, nor the absence of provocation by the victim who was set upon. Nor does it appear from the remarks on sentence that his Honour was acquainted with the serious consequences for the victim, which included brain injury. His Honour acknowledged that the offence was serious and ordinarily would require a custodial sentence. However, having regard to the early plea of guilty and the subjective case, his Honour believed that it would not be in the community's interests to send the offender to goal. His Honour imposed a two year sentence suspended upon Mr Ross entering into a good behaviour bond. 
      
       
        
       The Sentencing Judge’s Comments 
       
     15 Judge Hosking was told of the sentence of Mr Jason Ross before he passed sentence upon the applicant. The remarks of Judge Herron were placed before him. When composing his own remarks on sentence, Judge Hosking stated that, in his view, the sentence of Judge Herron was inadequate. He said this: 
      
       
        
         
         “I am not convinced that his Honour understood the true seriousness of these offences and, again with the greatest respect to his Honour, in my view that sentence was manifestly inadequate.” 
         
        
       
     16 His Honour noted that a Crown appeal had been lodged. Further, his Honour sought to distinguish the case of Mr Kollas from that of Jason Ross. He said this: 
      
       
        
         
         “The principal differences are that Jason Ross was not the instigator of these offences but that this offender was the instigator of them. Secondly, and more importantly in my view, whereas Jason Ross pleaded guilty, the accused did not plead guilty and is therefore not entitled to the same discount given to his co-offender who did. In my view, I have no alternative to impose a full time custodial sentence upon the offender.” 
         
        
       
     17 Mr Kollas who was involved from the outset. It was he who had recruited Mr Ross and others from the hotel. Mr Kollas had also used the club-lock as a weapon. 
      
       
        
       The Crown Appeal against Mr Ross 
       
     18 The Director of Public Prosecutions filed an affidavit which set out the course of the Crown appeal against the sentence imposed upon Mr Jason Ross. The matter came before the Court of Criminal Appeal on 14 August 2001. Mr Ross did not appear. The matter was refixed for 27 November 2001. Again, Mr Ross did not appear. The court was told that Mr Ross had gone to New Zealand. The Probation and Parole Service had commenced proceedings for breach of the bond. The appeal proceedings had been adjourned. They are listed before the Registrar of the Court of Criminal Appeal on 4 March 2002. This Court has been told that, so far as the Crown is concerned, the appeal is still on foot. 
      
       
        
       The Appeal by Mr Kollas 
       
     19 Broadly, the applicant relies upon two grounds of appeal.  
      
       
     · First, there is an argument based upon parity. Given the sentence upon Mr Jason Ross, it was suggested that Mr Kollas has a justifiable sense of grievance. 
      
       
     · Secondly, the finding of special circumstances justified a more significant reduction of the non-parole period than given by the sentencing judge. 
      
       
     20 I will deal with each aspect. 
      
       
        
       The Parity Argument 
       
     21 It would no doubt be convenient had the Crown appeal against Mr Jason Ross's sentence been heard before the determination of this appeal. If it were allowed, the supposed justifiable sense of grievance of the applicant may have no foundation. If it were not allowed, then the court would be in a position to approach this appeal with the remarks of the appellate court in mind. 
      
       
     22 However, Mr Ross may or may not return to Australia. Even were he to do so, the resolution of his appeal may be some way off. I believe that there is material which enables this Court to deal with the matter at this time. 
      
       
     23 The applicant drew attention to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in The Queen v Doan (2000) 115 A Crim R 497. This was a case where a trial judge was confronted by a sentence imposed by another judge which he believed to be inadequate. The sentencing judge, Freeman DCJ, did not, in these circumstances, feel himself obliged to impose a sentence which took as its benchmark the inadequate sentence in the other case. To do so, in his judgment, would have perpetuated the error. Rather, his Honour believed that he should approach the sentencing task conservatively, that is, fixing a sentence which was ""at the bottom the range of adequacy"". On appeal, Grove J (with whom the Chief Justice and myself agreed), noted that such an approach reflected the suggestion of Anderson J in Western Australia in The Queen v Capper (1994) 69 ACR 64, where his Honour said this: 
      
       
        
         
         ""When a co-offender has been treated with excessive leniency, justice may sufficiently be done if the prisoner receives as lenient a sentence as can be justified within the accepted range for this kind of offence in the light of matters personal to the prisoner, including his record ...” 
         
        
       
     24 See also R v Tislandis (1982) 2 NSWLR 430 at 434-435. In The Queen v Diamond (CCA, unreported, 8 February 1993) in a dissenting judgment, Smart J, suggested that it may be appropriate in such circumstances for a sentencing judge to impose a sentence which might not be as heavy as might otherwise have been imposed.  
      
       
     25 Here, the sentencing judge referred to the case of The Queen v Diamond. He did not, in terms, refer to the need to approach his task conservatively. However, I regard the sentence imposed by his Honour as conservative. I do not believe that any lesser sentence is warranted. Before the Court should intervene, exercising its powers under the Court of Criminal Appeal Act, 1912 (s6(3)), it must form an opinion that “some other sentence ... is warranted in law and should have been passed” (cf Spigelman CJ, R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534 para 79). I would therefore reject the argument which is based upon parity. 
      
       
        
       Special Circumstances 
       
     26 So far as special circumstances are concerned, there were, as his Honour identified, matters which justified the finding of special circumstances. His Honour duly made such a finding. His Honour was obliged in fixing an appropriate sentence to determine the minimum time which justice required that Mr Kollas should serve before release on parole (Power v The Queen (1973) 131 CLR 623; R v Simpson (supra) paras 55 to 59). As a matter of discretion, that required only a small adjustment to the period which would otherwise apply under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999. Again, I do not believe that there was an error. It was a matter within his Honour’s discretion. I would likewise reject the second ground. 
      
       
     27 The order that I propose therefore is as follows. I would give leave to argue the appeal. However, the appeal should be dismissed. 
      
       
     28 HIDDEN J: I agree. The order of the Court will be as proposed by Kirby J.

      REGINA v Chinh Vu Quoc LE 
       
       
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 KIRBY J: Chinh Vu Quoc Le (the applicant) was charged with an offence under s 25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (“the Act”). The indictment, omitting formal parts, was in these terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “That between 23 August 1999 and 22 September 1999 he did, on three or more separate occasions, supply a prohibited drug, namely, heroin for financial or material reward.” 
         
        
       
     2 Mr Le pleaded guilty. On 29 March 2001 he was sentenced by Blanch CJ DC to imprisonment for five years with a non parole period of three years. The sentence was backdated to 7 March 2000 to reflect time in custody. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of that sentence.  
      
       
        
       The Offence 
       
     3 Mr Le was arrested at premises at Newtown. The premises had obviously been established for the sale of drugs. Access was by means of a side lane. Entry was through a gate which was locked and topped with barbed wire. Neighbours complained about the traffic of persons to and from the premises. 
      
       
     4 On 22 September 1999 the police acted on these complaints. They arrested a person, not the applicant, who was known to be associated with the premises. They also conducted surveillance, observing the passage of people to and from the premises during the course of the day. Ultimately the police entered the premises, forcing the side gate. The applicant, Mr Le, was inside the house. He was seated on the floor. He was surrounded by the familiar paraphernalia of drug dealing. He had electronic scales, which he acknowledged were his, a razor blade and the remnants of a block of heroin. He had himself already smoked heroin that day. 
      
       
     5 The police interviewed others within the premises. They were addicts who had used the premises as their source of supply in the month or so preceding. They had dealt with Mr Le and another individual, being the person arrested earlier that day. 
      
       
     6 His Honour recognised that it was necessary to form some appreciation of the magnitude of the operation (Hulme J, Regina v Smiroldo [2000] NSWCCA 120 paras 14-17). The witnesses who provided the police with statements were vague as to the frequency of their dealings and whether they dealt with the applicant or an associate. His Honour noted that the indictment charged more than three occasions of supply in the course of a month, that the amounts supplied were small, and that it was not possible to say where in the hierarchy of drug supply Mr Le should be placed. 
      
       
        
       The Subjective Case 
       
     7 Before going to his Honour’s remarks on sentence, and the complaints made on this appeal, it is convenient to identify the significant matters which were raised which were personal to the applicant, that is, the subjective characteristics of his case. First was his youth. He was born on 7 February 1981. He was eighteen at the time of these offences. He was just twenty when sentenced. He had never been to prison before, though he had a number of criminal convictions. Mr Le came before the Children’s Court on two occasions, the first in 1997 (take and drive conveyance and driving without a licence). In 1999 he was placed on a bond for having goods in custody reasonably suspected of having been stolen and possessing a prohibited drug. He was charged with larceny and shoplifting in February 2000. 
      
       
     8 Secondly, Mr Le suffered significant dislocation in his early life. He was born in Vietnam. His family had fled to Malaysia where they were accepted as refugees. They had emigrated to New Zealand. In 1992 his parents separated. They moved to Australia. There was an attempt at reconciliation, which was unsuccessful. They permanently separated in 1994. 
      
       
     9 Thirdly, there were positive signs for the applicant’s rehabilitation. I will return to this issue shortly. 
      
       
        
       Complaints About Sentence 
       
     10 Dealing with the complaints made about the sentence imposed by his Honour, three things were said on behalf of the applicant:· First, that his Honour erred in giving insufficient weight to the plea of guilty;· Secondly, there was error in giving insufficient weight to the applicant’s youth;· Thirdly, that the sentence was manifestly excessive. 
      
       
        
       First and Second Grounds 
       
     11 The applicant made some admissions upon arrest. However, his plea of guilty was a late plea, as his counsel acknowledged. His Honour referred to the plea in his remarks. He acknowledged the need for a discount to reflect that plea and that it was a sign of contrition. No error is manifest in his Honour’s remarks. 
      
       
     12 Moving to the second complaint, his Honour was certainly conscious of the applicant’s youth. He referred to his age at the time of the offences (18) and the fact he had just turned 20 at the time of the sentence. His Honour was also conscious of the fact it was his first time in custody. It is clear, therefore, that his Honour did not overlook this important aspect in the applicant’s case, nor mistake the principles which should guide him. 
      
       
        
       Was the Sentence Manifestly Excessive? 
       
     13 The real complaint of the applicant concerns the sentence which his Honour determined, taking these various issues into account. It is said that it was manifestly excessive, such that, even though his Honour averted to relevant criteria, he must have given insufficient weight to such criteria. 
      
       
     14 The applicant drew attention to the statistics of the Judicial Commission. Such statistics in respect of these offences must be approached with some caution. The magnitude of the operation will not always be apparent. (Barr J, Regina v Huang and Lin [2001] NSWCCA 76 at para 24). Having said that, the statistics certainly suggest that the sentence imposed upon the applicant was toward the upper end of cases reflected in the sample. 
      
       
     15 Perhaps a more reliable guide is provided by the circumstances of the individual cases, and the sentences imposed. A comparison of one case with another has its difficulties. The sentence is necessarily a synthesis of the objective criminality and the subjective circumstances of the person being sentenced. 
      
       
     16 Having said that, the sentence imposed upon the applicant is significantly longer than the cases in the schedule provided with the applicant’s submissions, apart from Huang and Lin, where the operation was substantially larger. 
      
       
     17 The Crown pointed to the policy behind s25A of the Act. As Wood CJ at CL said in Regina v Khaled [2001] NSWCCA 169, that section was introduced to provide a strong deterrent to those who may be tempted to engage in ongoing trade in heroin or other drugs. In this case his Honour, in his remarks, emphasised what he terms “a significant element of general deterrence so far as the community is concerned”. However, deterrence, though significant, must, to some degree, yield to rehabilitation in the case of young offenders. Mathews J (with whom Gleeson CJ and Samuels JA agreed) analysed the authorities in R v GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 112, where she said this: (at 116) 
      
       
        
         
         “The approach to be adopted in the sentencing of young offenders has been discussed in a number of cases. In  
         Wilcox 
          (unreported, Supreme Court, NSW, 15 August 1979), Yeldham J remarked during the course of sentencing of a young offender that ‘in the case of a youthful offender … considerations of punishment and of general deterrence of others may properly be largely discarded in favour of individualised treatment of the offender, directed to his rehabilitation’” 
         
        
       
     18 Commenting on that decision, Mathews J added: (at 116) 
      
       
        
         
         “Subsequent decisions of this Court, however, suggest that considerations of general deterrence should not be ignored completely when sentencing young offenders. … 
          
           
          
         In  
         C, S and T 
          (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, Gleeson CJ, Allen and Studdert JJ, 12 October 1989), Gleeson CJ accepted a submission that 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘in sentencing young people … the consideration of general deterrence is not as important as it would be in he case of sentencing an adult and considerations of rehabilitation should always be regarded as very important indeed.’” 
           
          
         
        
       
     19 Here, there were encouraging signs of the applicant’s potential for rehabilitation. First, he was a very young man. At the time of this appeal, several years after the offences, he is just twenty one years old. Secondly, his addiction to heroin was not one of long-standing. He resorted to drugs when aged seventeen and a half. These events occurred approximately one year later. Thirdly, his arrest and incarceration have brought about his detoxification. He provided a letter to the sentencing judge which was poignant and was in these terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “I have heroin addiction which destroyed everything. A year has passed so slow inside for me, about six months ago I realised that not only is justice served but it has also saved my life. I also realised that the only way I become a normal person again was to admit that I was wrong and admit that I needed help. If given a chance I will be a law-abiding citizen again, be the person that my parents pictured me to be.” 
         
        
       
     20 The letter, to my mind, suggests some insight and a commitment to reform. 
      
       
     21 Fourthly, whilst in gaol he has been given the position of sweeper, which is a position of trust. A number of certificates have been tendered to this Court which deal with courses completed by the applicant whilst in prison. There is, I believe, reason for optimism in respect of the applicant’s rehabilitation. 
      
       
     22 I am persuaded that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. I believe, therefore, that this Court should intervene and re-sentence. For the reasons his Honour stated, I would find special circumstances. Mr Le certainly will require extensive supervision upon completion of his non parole period. The element of deterrence, both personal and general, remain very real considerations. 
      
       
     23 The sentence which I believe is appropriate in the circumstances, and especially having regard to the applicant’s youth, is imprisonment for four years, commencing on 7 March 2000 with a non parole of two years, expiring on 6 March 2002. 
      
       
        
       Orders 
       
     24 The orders I would propose are as follows: 
      
       
        
       1. Leave to appeal should be granted. 
        
        
       2. The appeal should be allowed and the sentence quashed. 
        
        
       3. In lieu of that sentence, I would propose the applicant be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of four years commencing on 7 March 2000, and with a non parole period of two years expiring on 6 March 2002, at which time the applicant will be eligible for release on parole. 
        
       
     25 HIDDEN J: I agree. The orders of the Court will be those proposed by Kirby J.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 HODGSON JA: I agree with Levine J. 
      
       
     2 LEVINE J: The appellant was charged with murder and stood trial before Dunford J and a jury in July 2000. He pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter on the basis of provocation. The plea was not accepted by the Crown and the appellant was found guilty of murder and was sentenced by his Honour to a total term of fifteen years with a non-parole period of seven years. This appeal is against conviction only. 
      
       
     3 The offence was committed on 12 February 1988 when the appellant was 18 years old. His involvement in the offence came to light some eleven years later when fingerprints found on a beer can at the scene of the crime were identified as belonging to him. 
      
       
     4 He had attended a party at Chatswood. During the course of the evening he drank a considerable quantity of beer and also inhaled a line of amphetamine. Some time later in the evening he was attempting to hitch a ride to his home at Beacon Field. He was picked up by the deceased who took him to his (the deceased’s) home at Harbord. 
      
       
     5 The deceased, Mr Leo Press, was a 63 year old man who lived with his brother and niece. There was evidence that police investigations revealed that it was his practice to go out late at night to solicit sex from hitchhikers and the like. In circumstances where his brother was at work on nightshift at their bakery, and having earlier in the evening dropped his niece off at the airport to go home to her parents a Quirindi, (i.e., knowing no one was at home), he took the appellant to his home. The appellant gave evidence that the deceased picked him up while he was hitching a ride home and invited him to the deceased’s home at Harbord to have “more beers”. Not long after drinking the beer, the appellant felt unwell and said that he had to “crash”. He woke up to discover the deceased playing with his genitals and kissing his face, including on the lips. It seems he was both scared and offended by the homosexual advance. He was at least scared by the time he found the hammer which he used to hit the deceased a number of times. He did, however deny that he was angry. 
      
       
     6 Evidence led at trial from Dr Bradhurst established that the assault commenced upstairs and ended downstairs near the entrance foyer. The deceased was hit over the head 10 to 12 times with a bricklayer’s lump hammer and this was located near his body. There were a number of deep lacerations to his head, skull fracture and brain damage. Any one of the blows could have caused death. 
      
       
     7 The first two grounds of appeal are interconnected and are as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         Ground 1: The trial judge failed to direct the jury adequately in relation to the use which could be made of a conversation between Detective Inspector Wilkins and the appellant together with an electronically recorded interview of him. 
         
        
        
         
         Ground 2: The trial miscarried by reason of admission into evidence of the material referred to in Ground 1. 
         
        
       
     8 The grounds arise, it is said, from the following aspects of the trial. Evidence was admitted, without objection, of a conversation between Detective Wilkins and the appellant, followed by a record of interview in which the appellant gave general denials and then determined to stay silent (see SU38-39, T110-111). After cautioning the appellant, the following conversation took place: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. As I told you, I am investigating the murder of Leo Press some 10 years ago. I want to ask you questions in relation to this mater. Do you understand that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. The murder of Leo Press took place between 12 and 13 February 1988 at 78 Oliver St, Harbord. Do you understand that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you know this person Leo Press? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Have you ever heard of him? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Have you ever been to a house at 78 Oliver St, Harbord? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you have any knowledge relating to the murder of Leo Press? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No, I do not. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Just so it is clear in my mind, you have no knowledge of the person Leo Press, you have never been to 78 Oliver St, Harbord and you have no information or knowledge in relation to the murder of Leo Press between 12 and 13 February 1988, is that correct? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes, that is right”. 
         
        
       
     9 The appellant was then informed by Detective Wilkins that he wished to record the conversation. The appellant contacted a solicitor and an ERISP was conducted. In the course of that electronic interview, the appellant agreed that the conversation as above had taken place. Following adoption of the conversation in the ERISP, the Detective asked further questions including the following: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q38: All right. I now wish to tell you Mr Hodge, that suspect fingerprints were located by fingerprint experts on the 13th February 1988 at the murder scene at 78 Oliver Street, Harbord. Those fingerprints have now been identified as belonging to you. Do you understand this? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q39. Is there anything that you wish to tell me about this matter? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well I know nothing concerning this murder in 1988 and on legal advice I don’t wish to answer any further questions at this time”. 
         
        
       
     10 The denials were the subject matter of cross-examination of the appellant (T178.25–43): 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Sir you twice yesterday gave evidence it had taken you a long time to come to terms with what you did to Mr Leo Press in 1988. Why did you lie to the police about having been involved in that matter? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Something that arose from a long time ago and I basically denied involvement. That was just my reaction at the time. 
         
        
        
         
         Q.  
         You told lies because you were aware you had murdered Mr Press, I suggest to you? 
          
          
         A.  
         No 
         . 
          
          
         Q. Well, didn’t you tell lies to try to escape detection for your actions on that night? 
         
        
        
         
         A. It was just my first reaction” (emphasis added). 
         
        
       
     11 There was also cross-examination about the appellant having seen the deceased on the ground (T162.25-47): 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Do you remember him on the ground? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So at that point you say do you, your recollection doesn’t assist you, you have no memory of that point until what point? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Picking up some keys and making my way out. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. It wasn’t a single key, it was a bunch of keys, wasn’t it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. A small bunch of keys. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Where did you pick them up from? 
         
        
        
         
         A. It was on the carpet. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Next to Mr Press? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I was, I can’t remember exactly where on the carpet, I just remember seeing it. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you looked at the key couldn’t you see him as well? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No.” 
         
        
       
     12 After addresses and before Summing Up, his Honour raised with counsel whether or not lies in the case were relied upon as evidence of consciousness of guilt, or whether, on the other hand, they merely went to credit. In the brief exchange which followed, the Crown appeared to concede the answers in the record of interview did not go to consciousness of guilt. The Crown sought directions on consciousness of guilt with respect to a suggested lie as to whether or not he saw the deceased on the floor. The learned trial judge declined to give a consciousness of guilt direction in respect of that evidence and commented that “It might go to credit”. In respect of the record of interview and the conversation with Detective Wilkins, he stated that they could not go to a consciousness of guilt because they merely went to “whether he killed him or not”, a matter which was not in dispute. 
      
       
     13 In summarising how the Crown put its case, his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         She [the Crown] suggested that he told lies in court particularly when he said he did not see the deceased lying on the ground and  
         she suggested to you that he only remembers what he has to remember 
         ”. (SU50.8) 
         ” (emphasis added). 
         
        
       
     14 I add that in his Summing Up, his Honour in reviewing the submissions made by Senior Counsel for the appellant said to the jury, “he submitted he is not telling lies but telling the truth” (SU52). 
      
       
     15 As is acknowledged for the appellant Senior Counsel who appeared at the trial took no objection to the admissibility of the evidence and sought no relevant directions before or at the conclusion of his Honour’s Summing Up.  
      
       
     16 For the appellant it is submitted that the evidence of the general denials was not admissible in the Crown case unless it went to establish a consciousness of guilt. That evidence, it is said, consisted of previous representations of the appellant which could only come into evidence as implied admissions under Pt 3.4 of the Evidence Act 1995. The evidence should not have been admitted at all notwithstanding the failure of counsel to take any objection to it. 
      
       
     17 Given however that the evidence was in fact admitted and was cross-examined upon by the prosecutor and was the subject of specific submission by her in respect, at least, of the in-Court lie, it is argued that the evidence should have been the subject of appropriate directions in accordance with the High Court’s decision in Zoneff v The Queen (2000) 200 CLR 234. The jury, it is submitted, were given no direction as to what use to make of the evidence of the interview or the in-Court lie at all. It is argued that his Honour’s Summing Up, which summarised the Crown submissions (and which also summarised the defence submissions) would have left the jury with the impression that that lie, at least, could have been used as evidence of consciousness of guilt. 
      
       
     18 The statements made by the appellant in the conversations with the police officer set out above, the Crown submits, although exculpatory are capable of being adverse to his interests in the outcome of his trial and accordingly are capable of being implied admissions within Pt 3.4 of the Evidence Act: Queen v Horton (1998) 48 NSWLR 46; Queen v Reid  [1999] NSWCCA 258 at [58] per Smart AJ. In the absence of any objection being taken by Senior Counsel for the appellant at trial, the evidence was admissible and there was no basis for its rejection (see Reid at [5] per Spigelman CJ), the Crown submits. There is, however, a real question whether the statements could properly be so regarded in a trial where the appellant acknowledged guilt of manslaughter. That is, the statements were capable of being adverse to the appellant’s interests and thus implied admissions because they were lies which could indicate consciousness of guilt; but in my opinion they could indicate consciousness of guilt of manslaughter (which the appellant admitted at the trial) no less than consciousness of guilt of murder, and thus could not be admissible on that basis in this trial. 
      
       
     19 However, if Senior Counsel for the appellant had objected on the just referred to basis, the statements could still have been put to the appellant in cross-examination on his credit, and thus almost inevitably the jury would have learnt in that way that the appellant did tell these lies. The failure of experienced Senior Counsel to object may well have been a tactical decision as to the least harmful way to have this material introduced into the case. Accordingly, in my opinion, no error by the trial judge is shown, and no reasons to give leave under rule 4 to allow this point to be taken. 
      
       
     20 It is in any event clear that notwithstanding the line of cross-examination by the Crown prosecutor emphasised above, the Crown did not put to the jury, as I understand the Summing Up, any lie other than that identified relating to whether or not the appellant saw the deceased. Nor is it in any way apparent that any lie referred to in the course of addresses or indeed, in the Summing Up, was referred to for any purpose other than as going to the credit of the appellant. This is made the more clear, in my view, by the reference by his Honour the trial judge in Summing Up to the submission made by Senior Counsel for the appellant to which I have referred above. 
      
       
     21 I am not persuaded that the reference by his Honour to a submission made by the Crown (see paragraph 12 above) points to the Crown seeking to advance, contrary to the agreed state of affairs, that the lie was by reason of consciousness of guilt. The addresses by Counsel are not available to this Court; for myself, the reference by his Honour to a statement by the Crown that “he only remembers what he has to remember” is unclear as to its significance. It is not as if his Honour said that the Crown had submitted that the appellant only remembered what he “wanted/wished” to remember. The phrase employed by his Honour (assuming it to be correctly recorded) is a curious one but in the end I am not satisfied that it advances the contention for the appellant. 
      
       
     22 As stated above, no direction was sought in accordance with Zoneff or on any other basis in relation to lies. It was merely the defence position that the lie did not go to a consciousness of guilt. Further, neither the trial judge nor counsel for the appellant, so it seems to me, considered that there was any risk that the jury would use the lie relied upon in an unacceptable way. They had been addressed by counsel in a way that defined the issue on the lies being one of credibility. In these circumstances I am not persuaded that Zoneff required any such direction in the circumstances of the trial nor that his Honour’s failure to give one was an error (Queen v Dhanhoa [2001] NSWCCA 293 at [12]). 
      
       
     23 It was submitted for the appellant that the Zoneff direction was required notwithstanding its “newness”. The judgment of the High Court was delivered on 25 May 2000 approximately five weeks before the commencement of this trial (4 July 2000). Nothing, of course, turns on that chronology. It is significant however, in my view, that Zoneff was a case extraordinary in its circumstances: an unrepresented accused, no closing address by the Crown and the trial judge unilaterally, as I understand the situation, having directed the jury on lies on the issue of consciousness of guilt. The subject matter of their Honours consideration in Zoneff was not “new” to the High Court. 
      
       
     24 In Osland v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 316 the Court was concerned with similar considerations. That decision itself was the subject of reference by Howie J in R v Moussa [2001] NSWCCA 427 where his Honour said:  
      
       
        
         
         “In that case the appellant had carried out post-offence deceptive conduct to give the impression that the deceased, her husband, had disappeared when she knew that he was dead. 
           
         The Crown did not rely upon that evidence as giving rise to a consciousness of guilt and, therefore, the trial judge did not indicate to the jury that they might use her conduct as evidence of her guilt nor did he gave an  
         Edwards 
          direction. Gaudron and Gummow JJ said about this matter:  
         
        
        
         
          
           
           [43] 
             
           Although the jury was not instructed that Mrs Osland's lies might be evidence of her consciousness of guilt, there was a real risk that it might reason that, because she lied about her husband's disappearance, she must have known he had been the victim of premeditated murder. Indeed, the prosecution suggested as much, inviting the jury to find that her conduct was not that ""of a person who had killed somebody with lawful justification or excuse”. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           [44] Where, as here, there is a risk that a jury might treat lies as evidence of guilt, the preferable course is for the trial judge to ascertain precisely what use the prosecution contends may be made of the evidence in question. And if the evidence is to be left to the jury as evidence of guilt, it should be instructed as required by Edwards v The Queen. If not, it should be instructed that the evidence is relevant only to the credit of the accused. Only by adopting that course can a trial judge guard against ""a perceptible risk of injustice"".  
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           [45] 
             
           Although it is not necessary to express a view on the matter, it is difficult, if not impossible, to conclude that the trial judge's failure to follow the course indicated above could have resulted in a miscarriage of justice in this case. Counsel for Mrs Osland did not seek any clarification as to the use that might be made of the evidence of Mrs Osland's conduct. And she sought no direction with respect to it. It is difficult to resist the inference that she took the view that there was nothing to be gained by raising the matter”. 
           
          
         
        
       
     25 I come to a conclusion similar to that of Howie J in Moussa in this area. It is clear that the learned trial judge in his Summing Up to the jury gave no direction in relation to consciousness of guilt. That was not called for nor sought. It is equally clear that save for the two references above, his Honour gave no direction to the jury in terms of the proscribed reasoning process in relation to lies. His Honour was not asked to do so. He could well have given a direction at the request of the defence and would probably have done so if such a direction in fact had been sought. I am not at all persuaded that the failure the learned trial judge to give a direction along the lines now asserted to have been required by reason of the lies going to credibility (and not sought by Senior Counsel for the appellant) resulted in the possibility of a miscarriage of justice. 
      
       
     26 As the Crown has pointed out in its submissions the issue that concerned the jury, and it was the nub of the trial, was the issue of provocation. Further directions were sought about it and there is no reason, in my view, for coming to a view that the jury rejected the appellant’s case on that issue (which they clearly did) on the basis only of the effect of the lie referred to by the trial judge. 
      
       
     27 Leave is required under r 4 to argue these grounds: I am of the view that leave should be refused. I would add that if leave were granted and I was otherwise persuaded as to the merits of the appellant’s submissions I would be of the opinion that there had been no miscarriage of justice. The proviso to s 6 would apply.  
      
       
     28 The third ground of appeal (and it is a new ground of appeal) was that his Honour failed to direct the jury adequately in relation to the appellant’s selective silence. Again, no application for a direction was made in relation to this before Summing Up or addresses nor after the Summing Up. 
      
       
     29 His Honour directed the jury in relation to the appellant’s partial silence in the record of interview as follows: “You cannot hold that against him”. Complaint is made that the jury was not directed that it could not use the silence to draw an inference of consciousness of guilt or an inference relevant to the appellant’s credibility (see s 89 of the Evidence Act 1995). It is argued that the jury had to be directed not only as to the nature of the right to silence (which his Honour did), but specifically that no inference adverse to the accused may be drawn from its exercise. This requirement, said to be fundamental, was referred to by Badgery-Parker J in The Queen v Matthews (Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported, 28 May 1996 at 3).  
      
       
     30 His Honour was not required to use any particular form of words in directing the jury on the appellant’s silence: he was required to do no more than direct the jury as to the nature of the right and that no inference adverse to the appellant could be drawn. 
      
       
     31 What his Honour said was: “He had been told he did not have to answer any questions and you cannot hold that against him. He did not answer any further questions and that was his right and that is what he did” (SU39). 
      
       
     32 At the time the evidence was adduced no objection was taken and no application for a direction was made. Before or after the Summing Up no application for any direction was made. As the Crown has submitted that if such an application was made and his Honour’s directions had been seen by himself to be inadequate, any deficiency could have been remedied. The formula of words used by his Honour in his Summing Up, in my view, were apposite and adequate and in no way derogate from the authority of Matthews or Reeves (1992) 29 NSWLR 109.  
      
       
     33 Leave is required for this ground of appeal; it should be refused. I make similar observations as to the views to which I would otherwise come in terms of the proviso to s 6.  
      
       
     34 It is to be borne in mind that the appellant by his plea of guilty to manslaughter admitted that he killed the deceased. In his evidence he admitted that he had inflicted two blows upon the deceased with the hammer after he had shrugged off the deceased and that after the first blow which he inflicted to the back of the deceased’s head while they were face to face he had inflicted a second when the deceased was going away from him. The appellant accepted (but did not remember) the evidence of Dr Bradhurst that the deceased had had inflicted upon him 10 to 12 blows. 
      
       
     35 As the Crown has submitted, the deceased’s injuries in the light of that evidence, was very serious and violent and the Crown case negativing provocation was a strong one.  
      
       
     36 The jury was well entitled to reject the appellant’s version and to prefer the Crown case even without the admission of the matter complained of, evidence strongly pointed to the jury’s rejection of provocation. 
      
       
     37 Accordingly, I am of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed. 
      
       
     38 HOWIE J: I agree.

      REGINA v. David John McINTYRE 
       
      Judgment 
     1 HODGSON JA: On 26 March 2001, the appellant was indicted before Bell J on a charge that he, between 29 July 1999 and 11 August 1999 at Coffs Harbour in the State of New South Wales, did murder Luke Gregory. He pleaded not guilty and the trial proceeded before Bell J and a jury. 
      
       
     2 On 24 April 2001 the jury returned a verdict of guilty. On 19 June 2001 Bell J sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for twenty-two years, commencing 14 August 1999, with a non-parole period of seventeen years, expiring on 13 August 2016. 
      
       
     3 In the original notice of appeal, the appellant indicated a desire to appeal against conviction and sentence. However, only one ground of appeal is relied on, namely that the trial judge erred in admitting certain evidence, so it is apparent that the application for leave to appeal against sentence is not being pursued. 
      
       
     4 I will briefly summarise the Crown case at the trial.  
      
       
     5 The body of the deceased, a fourteen-year-old boy, was found on 10 August 1999 near Sealy Lookout Road in Bruxner Park, Coffs Harbour. At the trial, issue was taken on the identification of the body, but the Crown case on this was strong and no issue is taken on appeal. The deceased was wearing a jacket and shirt but no pants or underpants. His legs were enclosed in a black plastic garbage bag. Post mortem examination disclosed two stab wounds, either of which would have been fatal, one to the throat, the other to the heart. It also disclosed injuries inflicted after death. Firstly, the penis and scrotum had been cut off and were found in a separate plastic garbage bag near the body. Second, the anus showed evidence of traumatic injury. Third, there was a long incised wound on the right thigh extending down to the bone, with six superficial marks at the site, consistent with being saw marks. There was no substantial issue at the trial as to these matters.  
      
       
     6 There was also evidence that the death occurred at least five days prior to 10 August 1999, from the condition of the body and also insect fauna found on the body. It was contended for the appellant at the trial that the insect fauna suggested that the body had been there no more than about five days, although the expert who gave evidence said it could have been somewhat longer. 
      
       
     7 The appellant, who was aged forty-five in 1999, had been a friend of the deceased’s mother, Jeanette Gregory, for some years. Mrs Gregory had lived close to the appellant’s house in Anderson Street, Bayldon, with her three children, Matthew, Luke (the deceased) and Jamie. She was a single mother. The appellant used to take the boys on fishing and camping trips. In mid-1999, Mrs Gregory moved to Bonville, a suburb about 14 kilometres from Bayldon. The deceased commenced to spend much of his time at the appellant’s home and sometimes in the home of other friends in the Bayldon area. 
      
       
     8 Evidence was given by the deceased’s mother that about two weeks prior to his death, that is in about mid July 1999, the deceased returned to her home. According to the mother, the deceased was visibly upset, and when questioned by her, told her the appellant had said to him that he could keep a puppy at the appellant’s house if the deceased allowed him, the appellant, to “suck his doodle”. Mrs Gregory advised the deceased against returning to the appellant’s home, but the deceased said he could look after himself, and was going to sleep with a knife under his pillow or mattress, to protect himself and another boy from the appellant. 
      
       
     9 It is the admission of some of that evidence that is challenged on this appeal.  
      
       
     10 Another acquaintance of the deceased, James Nelson, who was the father of two friends of the deceased, gave evidence that the deceased stayed with him between about 18 July and 22 July 1999. According to Mr Nelson, when he arrived, the deceased said he had spent the previous night at the appellant’s home with a friend, and also said words to the effect: “I sleep with a knife under my pillow, I don’t trust Dave”, Dave being the appellant. 
      
       
     11 Some time after this, the appellant collected the deceased from Mr Nelson’s house. It is not entirely clear on the evidence whether this was on 22 July or Wednesday 28 July. In any event, it is clear that the deceased spent the night of Thursday 29 July at the appellant’s house. The appellant on that day was helping Helen McIntyre, the ex-wife of his brother, in a move; and at about 10pm on that day the appellant and Mrs McIntyre went to the appellant’s house, where they found the deceased sleeping in the rain on the front veranda of the house. 
      
       
     12 On Friday 30 July, the appellant was again helping Mrs McIntyre with her moving, and was with her until about 9pm, although it appears that he returned to his own house at about 4pm in the afternoon for a brief visit. On that day, the deceased spent the afternoon in the company of some friends. One of them, Jason, had a car with a flat battery, and he offered to take the deceased and others joyriding if a battery could be found. The deceased gained access to the appellant’s home through a window, found the appellant’s car keys, used them to open the bonnet of the appellant’s car, and took the battery from the appellant’s car, an unregistered Chrysler Scorpion. The battery was put into Jason’s car, and Jason drove the deceased and some friends to the home of another friend.  
      
       
     13 Somewhat later, the police arrived and made enquiries about the stolen car battery, which they recovered. The police had in fact been contacted by the appellant, who discovered the theft of the battery when he returned home, apparently about 9 o’clock, and was told by a neighbour that the deceased and some friends had been seen at the car. 
      
       
     14 According to evidence of some of the deceased’s friends, the deceased left them at about 10.30pm that evening, saying he was going to stay at the appellant’s home and walking off in that direction. 
      
       
     15 On the morning of Saturday 31 July, one of the deceased’s friends went to the appellant’s house and asked if the appellant had seen the deceased. The appellant replied to the effect that he had not seen him since the previous afternoon. 
      
       
     16 Later that morning, the appellant’s sister-in-law took the appellant to a family property at Glenreagh for the weekend: this had been pre-arranged. On the way, the appellant dropped a receipt at the police station, which had been required so that he could collect his battery from the police. 
      
       
     17 On the evening of Sunday 1 August, the appellant’s half-brother drove the appellant back to the appellant’s home, taking with them a battery from a farm utility. The appellant installed this battery in his car, then the two of them set off in two cars to go back to Glenreagh. On the way, the appellant stopped and the half-brother also stopped, and the appellant told him that he wanted to go to the toilet. Then the appellant turned into Sealy Lookout Road, and he joined his half-brother some time later. 
      
       
     18 On Monday 2 August the appellant’s sister-in-law drove the appellant back to his home.  
      
       
     19 On Thursday 5 August the appellant obtained a loan of $700 from Fast Finance, and between 6 and 8 August he made arrangements for his carpets to be cleaned.  
      
       
     20 On 7 or 8 August, neighbours saw the appellant hosing down a concrete path outside his back door and the area where the appellant normally parked his car. 
      
       
     21 On 9 August a carpet cleaner came. According to his evidence, he saw a pattern of staining in the second bedroom, about one foot in diameter, and around the doorway of the lounge room. He used grease release to uplift these stains, this product being able to remove a variety of stains including blood. He saw the appellant washing the wall of the second bedroom adjacent to a waterbed there. 
      
       
     22 On Thursday 12 August, another neighbour noticed that the appellant’s garbage had not been emptied, that there was mattress material protruding from it. 
      
       
     23 On 14 August the police executed a search warrant on the appellant’s home. Their evidence was that they found a heavily stained foam mattress in a garbage bin in the rear yard of the premises, which had been cut into pieces. The staining on the mattress returned a positive presumptive test for the presence of blood. The interior of the bin also had staining, which returned a positive presumptive test for the presence of blood. The police found a saw located in the garbage bin, which had some staining and which also returned a positive presumptive test for the presence of blood. Pieces of a foam mattress were found under the house, portions of which fitted with those found in the garbage bin. A pair of boy’s Nike joggers with staining was located in a bag hanging on a wall under the house. The staining returned a strong positive result for blood. Residual staining was observed on the carpet in the second bedroom of the appellant’s home: this staining returned a positive result for the presence of blood. There were also other observations made. 
      
       
     24 The police took possession of the appellant’s vehicle subsequently, from the Glenreagh property. An examination of the boot of that vehicle revealed apparent blood staining on a black mat, together with flaky deposits of dried blood. 
      
       
     25 Evidence was called from a DNA expert. That was to the effect that the DNA recovered from the mattress and the black mat in the car had the same DNA profile as DNA recovered from the deceased, and that fewer than one in ten billion people in the general population had that DNA profile; and that the DNA recovered from the carpet in the second bedroom had the same DNA profile as the DNA recovered from the deceased, and that that DNA profile could be found in approximately one in 7.5 million people in the general population. 
      
       
     26 The appellant gave evidence, denying any involvement in the deceased’s murder and denying that he had seen the deceased after about 4pm on Friday 30 July. He gave evidence also that the mattress which had been found in the bin had been moved from the second bedroom to under the house in about June 1999, and that during the week commencing 9 August 1999 he had noticed that this mattress had a stain on it, which he thought was due to something a dog had brought in under the house. It was then he said that he cut the part of the mattress with the stains and placed it in the garbage bin. 
      
       
     27 The appellant also gave evidence that there had been occasions when the deceased had cut himself and had bled while staying at the house.  
      
       
     28 The appellant agreed there had been an occasion when the deceased asked if he could keep a small dog at the appellant’s house, but denied making any sexual suggestion to the deceased. 
      
       
     29 In relation to cleaning the house, the appellant said he had been thinking about doing it for a while. He said he was delayed in doing it because he had been doing work for his brother, and he also had to obtain a loan so he could have the carpets cleaned. He stated that it was his practice from time to time to hose down his driveway and front path to get rid of dirt and dog hair. 
      
       
     30 Focusing now on the issue on this appeal, at the trial the appellant’s Counsel took objection to Mrs Gregory’s evidence about the deceased’s statement concerning a sexual suggestion said to have been made by the appellant. 
      
       
     31 The trial judge found that this evidence was not excluded by the hearsay rule by reason of s.65 of the Evidence Act, which is as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         65(1) This section applies in a criminal proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is not available to give evidence about an asserted fact.  
          
         (2) The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, if the representation was:  
          
         (a) made under a duty to make that representation or to make representations of that kind, or  
          
         (b) made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred and in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication, or  
          
         (c) made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation is reliable, or  
          
         (d) against the interests of the person who made it at the time it was made.  
          
         (3) The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation made in the course of giving evidence in an Australian or overseas proceeding if, in that proceeding, the defendant in the proceeding to which this section is being applied:  
          
         (a) cross-examined the person who made the representation about it, or  
          
         (b) had a reasonable opportunity to cross-examine the person who made the representation about it.  
          
         (4) If there is more than one defendant in the criminal proceeding, evidence of a previous representation that:  
          
         (a) is given in an Australian or overseas proceeding, and  
          
         (b) is admitted into evidence in the criminal proceeding because of subsection (3),  
          
         cannot be used against a defendant who did not cross-examine, and did not have a reasonable opportunity to cross-examine, the person about the representation.  
          
         (5) For the purposes of subsections (3) and (4), a defendant is taken to have had a reasonable opportunity to cross-examine a person if the defendant was not present at a time when the cross-examination of a person might have been conducted but:  
          
         (a) could reasonably have been present at that time, and  
          
         (b) if present could have cross-examined the person.  
          
         (6) Evidence of the making of a representation to which subsection (3) applies may be adduced by producing a transcript, or a recording, of the representation that is authenticated by:  
          
         (a) the person to whom, or the court or other body to which, the representation was made, or  
          
         (b) if applicable, the registrar or other proper officer of the court or other body to which the representation was made, or  
          
         (c) the person or body responsible for producing the transcript or recording.  
          
         (7) Without limiting subsection (2) (d), a representation is taken for the purposes of that subsection to be against the interests of the person who made it if it tends:  
          
         (a) to damage the person's reputation, or  
          
         (b) to show that the person has committed an offence for which the person has not been convicted, or  
          
         (c) to show that the person is liable in an action for damages.  
          
         (8) The hearsay rule does not apply to:  
          
         (a) evidence of a previous representation adduced by a defendant if the evidence is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, or  
          
         (b) a document tendered as evidence by a defendant so far as it contains a previous representation, or another representation to which it is reasonably necessary to refer in order to understand the representation.  
          
         (9) If evidence of a previous representation about a matter has been adduced by a defendant and has been admitted, the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of another representation about the matter that:  
          
         (a) is adduced by another party, and  
          
         (b) is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the other representation being made. 
          
         
        
       The trial judge found that this evidence fell within paragraph (b) and also within paragraph (c) of s.65(2). No challenge is made to that finding. 
        
       
     32 Dealing with the substantial questions of whether the evidence was relevant and whether the risk of prejudice outweighed its probative value, the trial judge said this: 
      
       
        
         
         29. I am of the view that the deceased's representations concerning the sexual advance said to have been made (sic) him by the accused may be admitted as first hand hearsay pursuant to s.65 of the Act. It remains to consider whether this material meets the test of relevance. As I have noted, the Crown presses it as evidence of the relationship between the deceased and the accused. In R v Frawley (1993) 69 A Crim R 208 Gleeson CJ at 220 observed: 
          
          
           
           ""One of the difficulties affecting consideration of relationship evidence is that the concept of relationship is vague. In a particular case, such as the present, it may be necessary to identify with more precision what is in question."" 
           
          
          
         30. In the present case the Crown submits that the relationship between the accused and the deceased was one characterised by sexual attraction or interest on the part of the accused towards the deceased. The Crown submits that the mutilation of the body is consistent with the deceased's assailant being motivated at least in part by sexual considerations. 
          
          
         31. In Serratore Dunford J noted: 
          
           
           ""It is now well established that in murder trials, evidence of the relationship between the parties is relevant and admissible: Wilson v The Queen (1970) 123 CLR 334; R v Frawley (1993) 69 A Crim R 208;.R v Hissey (1973) 6 SASR 280; R v Ballantine (CCA 27 June 1978, unreported); R v Hurst (CCA 2 November 1983 unreported). 
            
            
           To reject the evidence would require the jury to examine the matter as if it happened in a vacuum: Wilson (at 334), per Menzies J. (at 106)."" 
           
          
          
         32. I consider that the evidence of the accused's sexual interest in the deceased is relevant for the reasons advanced by the Crown and that in the context of this case to exclude it would be to require the jury to examine the matter as if it happened in a vacuum. 
          
          
         33. I have considered whether the probative value of this evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. I am not of the view that it is. I will direct the jury as to the limited basis upon which this evidence is led and explain that it is not led as evidence of tendency. 
         
        
       
     33 In the summing up to the jury, the trial judge dealt with this matter in the following way: 
      
       
        
         
         Now there are some important directions I wish to give you concerning the evidence given by Mrs Gregory as to a statement made to her by the deceased. Namely that the accused had said to him he would let him keep the puppy if he, that is Luke, would let the accused suck his doodle. That evidence was admitted for a limited purpose, and it is most important that you bear that limitation in mind. The evidence was not lead (sic) to establish that the accused is a person with a tendency or a disposition to make sexual advances to adolescent youths. It would be improper for you to reason that the accused had such a tendency or disposition and to draw any inference adverse to him from that. The sole and limited basis upon which that evidence was lead (sic) is as tot eh nature of the relationship between the accused and the deceased. In that, if you accept it, the evidence suggests that the relationship was characterized by a sexual interest in Luke on the part of the accused. 
          
          
         The Crown points to the mutilation of the body and invites you to consider that either at the time of the killing or in the immediate aftermath the killer exhibited some form of what I will describe as sexual preoccupation with the deceased. 
         
        
       
     34 The trial judge went on then to give a strong direction on the potential unreliability of hearsay evidence. 
      
       
     35 The summing up subsequently recounted the Crown’s submissions relevant to this piece of evidence as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         Next I turn to the evidence concerning the accused's response to the theft of his battery and going to the question of the nature of his relationship with Luke. The Crown invites you to consider that the accused was angry with Luke and resentful over the rejection of the earlier sexual proposition, and that the killing occurred in this context. But I emphasise, it is not the Crown's case that there was a motive for killing Luke in the sense that the accused planned to kill Luke because of any sexual interest in the boy, or because he was angry with him over the battery, rather in the way the Crown puts its case it says these background features provide a context for an event which may well have been impulsive, and the Crown does not suggest was in any sense planned. 
         
        
       
     36 The trial judge then went on to summarise relevant evidence and to remind the jury of the warning she had given previously. 
      
       
     37 The appellant’s Counsel has provided comprehensive written submissions, the most relevant parts of which are as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         4. The evidence was the sole suggestion of any sexual attraction in the victim by the appellant. 
          
          
         5. The evidence was said to be relevant as the penis of the victim had severed. There was no expert evidence that the mutilation resulted from or could have resulted from a rejected sexual advance. If accepted, the doodle evidence, was only a request for consensual sexual activity. There was no suggestion of sexual violence. 
          
          
         6. The relationship evidence could not assist the jury in determining a fact in issue. It could not be said that a man who has an interest in sucking the penis of a fourteen year old boy, notwithstanding the rejection, would also sever the penis of the same boy. There was no suggestion of any anger or violence from the appellant to the victim as a result of the rejection in the weeks before the death. 
          
          
         7. It may be more likely that a person who is sexually attracted to a young male may have less reason to sever the penis. There are many men in Sydney who pay for sexual gratification from boy prostitutes who would never inflict any such mutilation on the young person. Most paedophiles feel that they do no wrong when engaging in sexual activity with young children because they feel it is an act of love. It would seem that the assumed link between attraction, rejection and mutilation may not exist. The evidence may not therefore have even been relevant. 
          
          
         8. In Gipp v R (1998) 194 CLR 106 the relationship evidence was admitted for the limited purpose of making the circumstances of the specified offences more intelligible. McHugh and Hayne JJ, referring to earlier High Court decisions said at 132.2: 
          
           
           'It was admissible because it was evidence ""as to acts so closely and inextricably mixed up with the history of the guilty act itself as to form part of one chain of relevant circumstances.""' 
           
          
          
         It cannot be said that the relationship evidence in this case had that same character. 
          
          
         9. Her Honour stated that to exclude the evidence would have required the jury to consider the evidence in a vacuum. That is not so. The vacuum exists, for example, when one considers why a particular victim offered no resistance to a sexual advance. The relationship history would explain that conduct. It would be inextricably linked to the crime. There was no such vacuum here. In any case, no vacuum should be or could be cured by speculation. 
          
          
         10. There could be varied reasons why mutilation occurs. On the Crown case the appellant was very angry with the victim for stealing his battery and killed him after a confrontation about it. It was put to the appellant that he killed the victim that night. If someone is angry enough with someone to kill them he is angry enough with them to mutilate the genitalia. 
          
          
         11. An alternative reason for the severing of the penis may have been the one referred to by her Honour during the sentencing. Her Honour at T8.46 says, in a discussion about the mutilation, that it evidences, amongst other things, 'a contempt for the person killed'. This is a logical explanation. The relationship evidence is not relevant to such contempt. There was no evidence from which an inference could be drawn that the rejection lead (sic) to a feeling of contempt towards the victim by the appellant. 
          
         12. Given the respective ages of the appellant and the victim, the evidence cast the appellant as a paedophile. It was not lead (sic )as tendency evidence however it is not possible to suggest that the appellant could have had a one-off sexual attraction to a young male. If it was one-off then there would be no relevance to the crime.13. The unfair prejudice is clear and the danger of unfair prejudice extreme. At the very least the evidence ought to have been excluded under s 137 of the Evidence Act. It could not be said that the probative value outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice. The danger that a jury may be willing to convict a paedophile is significant. It could not be said that the speculative link between the sexual offer and the mutilation was significantly probative.14. The hearsay and the injuries were not linked so as to raise the probative value of the evidence. For example, if the relationship evidence was a request to bite the breast and that was how a body was found then the link would be clear such as to make the hearsay evidence probative. However that does not appear here. It was assumed that simply because an unsuccessful sexual advance is made and there was mutilation of the genital area then the conclusion could be that the injuries resulted from anger from a sexual rejection.15. In discussion before the addresses, her Honour stated at 1096.30 that: 
          
           
           'I do not consider that any evidence as to the post-mortem findings is capable of establishing sexual interference with the deceased either before or after death'. 
           
          
          
         Her Honour continues by saying that the evidence was admitted as it was relevant to the relationship it being the Crown submission that it was open to the jury to infer that there was a sexual interest. However a sexual interest is irrelevant if it is not linked to the murder. Without sexual interference during or after the killing the sexual interest becomes irrelevant. An attempt to limit the use of evidence at this stage was rejected. 
          
          
         Despite this statement by her Honour the summing up at 12.5 stated: 
          
           
           'The Crown points to the mutilation of the body and invites you to consider that either at the time of the killing or in the immediate aftermath the killer exhibited some form of what I will describe as sexual preoccupation with the deceased.' 
           
          
          
         This should not have been left to the jury because it was not open. It was not open because the necessary link between the alleged sexual offer and the mutilation did not exist. As her Honour had said earlier, there was no sexual interference. It would be highly speculative to suggest that there was no sexual interference but that there was sexual preoccupation to the extent of mutilation. The suggestion is that the strong appellant, who had a sexual interest in the victim, would not sexually assault the frail victim, but would sever his penis. 
          
          
         16. A further problem is that the relationship evidence is not admitted by the appellant. 
          
          
         17. A further problem is that the evidence is hearsay. It does not allow the testing of the evidence. More importantly it does not have any regard to the accuracy of the alleged representation made by the appellant. The test in s 65 of the Evidence Act does not test the reliability of the representation from the appellant to the victim but rather the reliability of the representation from the victim to his mother. The provision does not test whether or not the victim may have been mistaken. 
          
          
         18. Another significant problem is the way in which the Crown conducted its case. It did not allege that the motivation for the killing was sexual rejection. The alleged doodle comment came weeks before the killing. The Crown stated that the killing may have been precipitated because the victim stole the appellant's car battery. In cross-examination it was put directly to the appellant that he stabbed the victim on the night of a confrontation over the battery (T1039). The theft, (where the appellant told the police that the victim stole the battery before the murder), was just before the killing. In fact her Honour, in the Remarks on Sentence at paragraph 22 on page 7 states that she could not conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the killing was the result of any sexual motive. Her Honour stated that the precipitating event may have been a confrontation over the battery. To suggest that the battery precipitated the killing but the anger caused the mutilation in circumstances of no sexual interference, is too speculative to allow the reception of evidence which says that the appellant is a paedophile. 
          
          
         19. This possible alternative demonstrates the danger of allowing the highly prejudicial evidence. If the jury is addressed on the basis that the battery may have motivated the killing then the danger of the misuse of the relationship evidence by the jury is greatly amplified. Her Honour failed to consider the theft of the battery in determining to admit the evidence. 
          
          
         20. The paedophilia evidence precluded the appellant from having a fair trial. 
         
        
       
     38 In oral submissions, Mr Thangeraj for the appellant submitted that it was not open for the jury to infer from the mutilation of the deceased’s body that his killer had some sexual preoccupation. He submitted that such a conclusion was too speculative. In any event, he submitted even that inference, if it was available, would provide no link to the appellant, because among other things such sexual interest or attraction as may have been suggested by the challenged evidence points against such conduct as post mortem mutilation, and points against the appellant having such contempt for the deceased as was suggested by the mutilation. Furthermore, Mr Thangeraj submitted, the mere circumstance of sexual attraction was not probative of anything. This was made clear, if one considered what would be the situation in the case of an indication of sexual attraction between an adult female and an adult male. In such case, the irrelevance was obvious, and so also it was in this case. 
      
       
     39 In relation to a suggestion that this evidence also had relevance as explaining and putting in context the evidence concerning the keeping of a knife under the deceased’s pillow, Mr Thangeraj submitted that that point had not been taken or relied on in any way below. He submitted that no such explanation was necessary in relation to the knife evidence, it had no relevance to it, and it could at best lead to speculation. 
      
       
     40 Mr Thangeraj submitted that the material admitted had the risk of extreme prejudice to the appellant. It suggested that the appellant was a paedophile, which could in turn lead the jury to reason either that he must have committed the offence because he was a paedophile, or alternatively that he should be locked up in any event because he was a paedophile. 
      
       
     41 Insofar as it was put by the Crown that this was only a small part of the Crown case, that supported the argument about prejudice; the less important the evidence was, the more readily it could be concluded that its probative value was outweighed by the risk of prejudice. 
      
       
     42 In my opinion, the conversation was evidence concerning the relationship between the appellant and the deceased, which was relevant to the question whether or not the appellant murdered the deceased.  
      
       
     43 As submitted by the Crown and decided by the primary judge, the after death mutilation of the deceased’s body does make relevant evidence that the appellant had expressed sexual interest in the deceased, which was apparently unwelcome to the deceased. The relevance does not depend on any view that a person with a sexual interest of this kind would be likely to mutilate a body: rather it is that such mutilation might to some limited extent be explicable in terms of some kind of sexual preoccupation, which could derive from sexual interest in the deceased; whereas if the killer had no sexual preoccupation or interest whatsoever in the deceased, the mutilation would seem wholly inexplicable. I think the mutilation does support an inference of some kind of sexual preoccupation, and while mere sexual interest of itself falls far short of such preoccupation, the existence of sexual interest has a bearing on the probability of the existence of a sexual preoccupation. 
      
       
     44 For those reasons, it seems to me that the evidence did have some relevance to the overall probability of the appellant being responsible for the death of the deceased. 
      
       
     45 I would add that in my opinion this evidence does had relevance in another way to the question of the appellant’s guilt. Evidence was admitted as noted before, from two sources of the deceased talking about sleeping with a knife under his mattress or pillow when staying at the appellant’s home. No appeal is brought from that decision, and in my opinion, in circumstances where the deceased was killed with a knife, that was relevant material, even though the murder weapon was not found, and there was a suggestion from the Crown that the murder weapon may have been a knife that was missing from a set owned by the appellant. 
      
       
     46 The evidence challenged on appeal contributed to an explanation of why the deceased may have slept with a knife. This explanation had some relevance in turn to the probability of the appellant actually doing what he said, that is sleeping with a knife, and some relevance in turn to the probability of an occasion arising of a disagreement between the deceased and the appellant where a knife might become involved. The challenged evidence was not relied on in this way below, or put in this way to the jury, but this relevance has some bearing in the event that it is necessary to consider whether the proviso applies. 
      
       
     47 Turning to the question of whether the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice, I accept the submission that there was some danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant, in the way suggested by the appellant’s counsel. The question before the trial judge was whether, in terms of s.137 of the Evidence Act, the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.  
      
       
     48 This question involves the weighing by a judge of incommensurables, of a kind which, in my opinion, should be overturned by an appellate court only if the appellate court is satisfied that the trial judge was wrong, either on the basis of the reasons given or on the basis of the unreasonableness of the result. 
      
       
     49 In my opinion, courts should not underestimate juries, and I note that the jury in this case was given appropriate directions not to use the material in a way which would unfairly prejudice the appellant. 
      
       
     50 Having regard to these considerations, I am not satisfied that the trial judge was wrong in the decision that she made that the probative value of the evidence was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. 
      
       
     51 I am also of the view that this is a case where, if necessary, the proviso should be applied. The Crown case was a very strong case. I have already expressed the view that the challenged evidence was admissible on a basis that was not dealt with below. The circumstantial evidence against the appellant was very strong. The DNA evidence linking blood from the deceased to the carpet in the bedroom where the deceased was accustomed to sleep, to a mattress, and to the boot of the appellant’s car, was compelling. The appellant’s explanation of the disposal of the mattress was extremely unconvincing. 
      
       
     52 Having regard to all these considerations, had the question arisen, I would have been satisfied that the appellant had not been deprived of a fair trial or of a reasonable possibility of acquittal by the trial judge’s failure to exclude the evidence. 
      
       
     53 For those reasons, in my opinion this appeal should be dismissed. I would also formally dismiss the application for leave to appeal from sentence.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
     1 HODGSON JA: I agree with Howie J. 
      
       
     2 LEVINE J: I agree with Howie J. 
      
       
     3 HOWIE J: The respondent was convicted after trial by jury of one count of malicious wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm contrary to s 33 of the Crimes Act. He was sentenced by Judge Karpin to imprisonment for 2 years that sentence being suspended upon the respondent entering into a bond to be of good behaviour in accordance with s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The maximum penalty prescribed for the offence was 25 years imprisonment. The Crown has appealed against what is asserted to be the inadequacy of the sentence imposed. 
      
       
     4 The wounding occurred during a fight between the respondent and the victim at an hotel. The Crown’s allegation was that the respondent used a piece of broken glass to inflict a severe gash to the neck of the victim. As a result the victim underwent emergency surgery and at the time of trial suffered permanent injuries being a substantial scar, an injury to his saliva gland and loss of sensory perception around one ear. 
      
       
     5 In the course of her sentencing remarks her Honour stated the facts as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         The offence arose from an on-going dispute between the prisoner’s now wife and her aunt, both of whom are about the same age. The victim was the boyfriend of the aunt at that time. Prior to the incident which gave rise to this conviction, there had been an earlier occasion on which following confrontation between the two women there had been a confrontation between the prisoner and the victim but not one of consequence. 
         
        
        
         
         On 17 July 1999 the prisoner, and his then girlfriend and now wife, were present at the Albion Hotel, as were the victim and his girlfriend. In the early hours of the morning a fight developed between the two women which involved punches being thrown by both of them. The victim moved towards the fighting women with apparently the intention of removing his girlfriend to safety. Before reaching them he heard the sound of breaking glass, he saw the prisoner walking toward him swinging his arm in a punching action. The victim was struck on the right side of the face, he immediately felt a throbbing, he fell to the ground with the prisoner. After about 30 seconds the prisoner was pulled off the victim who then put his hand to his neck and saw that it came away covered with blood. The victim was taken to hospital where he was treated for a fifteen centimetre long laceration to the right side of his neck. The wound was continuous and very deep extending to the jaw bone. Substantial damage had been caused, including the complete division of the muscle in the neck. 
         
        
        
         
         The medical practitioner who treated the victim’s wounds gave evidence to the effect that the most likely cause of this wound was part of a broken glass or bottle being drawn across the length of the wound. He believed that it would have required significant force to cause the level of injury sustained… 
         
        
       
     6 The issue in the trial was whether the respondent had caused the injury or whether it may have occurred when, during the scuffle with the respondent, the victim fell on broken glass on the floor. Judge Karpin found that the jury must have been satisfied that the victim’s version of events was true and that the prisoner must have been armed with a weapon of some kind fitting the description that which could have caused the injury sustained. 
      
       
     7 Her Honour made the following further comments about the nature of the offence committed by the respondent: 
      
       
        
         
         The offence occurred in the context of ill feeling leading to a physical confrontation between the prisoner’s wife and her aunt. No doubt feelings were running high. The prisoner and the victim had confronted one another on a prior occasion precipitated by the ongoing argument between these two women. The assault occurred in the heat of the moment and without apparent premeditation excepting that the prisoner clearly armed himself with broken glass or something similar. The assault was limited to one violent blow. It is fortunate for both the prisoner and his victim that the blow was not a little more forceful which could really have caused a life-threatening injury. 
         
        
       
     8 The Court has not been supplied with the transcript of the trial but the parties have supplemented the facts as recorded by her Honour in their written submissions. Those additional facts indicate that, as the altercation between the two women commenced, the respondent moved toward them for the purpose, so he told the police, of removing his wife to safety. The victim placed himself between the women and the respondent. Shortly after the two men commenced to wrestle, the sound of breaking glass was heard and the respondent swung his right hand toward the victim. The respondent’s right hand connected with the right side of the victim’s face. The two men wrestled on the floor for a short time before security guards intervened. 
      
       
     9 The substantial argument relied upon by the Crown in its attack upon the sentence imposed is that it fails to reflect the objective circumstances of the offence, bearing in mind the nature of the crime of which the respondent was convicted by the jury. Before considering the submission in light of the subjective circumstances of the respondent, it is apposite once more to quote a passage from this Court’s judgement in Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354 to which reference is often made when this Court has been called upon to consider the exercise of the sentencing discretion under appeal by the Crown: 
      
       
        
         
         As Jordan CJ pointed out in  
         Geddes 
          at 556 
         , making due allowance for all relevant considerations, there ought to be a reasonable proportionality between a sentence and the circumstances of the crime, and we consider that it is always important in seeking to determine the sentence appropriate to a particular crime to have regard to the gravity of the offence viewed objectively, for without this assessment the other factors requiring consideration in order to arrive at the proper sentence to be imposed cannot properly be given their place. Each crime, as  
         Veen (No 2) 
          (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 472; 33 A Crim R 230 at 234 stresses, has its own objective gravity meriting at the most a sentence proportionate to that gravity, the maximum sentence fixed by the legislature defining the limits of sentence for cases in the most grave category. The relative importance of the objective facts and subjective features of a case will vary: see, for example, the passage from the judgment of Street CJ in  
         Todd 
          [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 quoted in  
         Mill 
          (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 64; 36 A Crim R 468. Even so, there is sometimes a risk that attention to persuasive subjective considerations may cause inadequate weight to be given to the objective circumstances of the case:  
         Rushby 
          [1977] 1 NSWLR 594. 
         
        
       
     10 Before referring to the subjective circumstances of the respondent it is important, in light of the passage quoted above, to note the seriousness of the offence for which the respondent had been convicted and the implications of the jury’s finding that he had inflicted a serious wound upon the victim with an intention to cause grievous bodily harm. 
      
       
     11 The offence carried the highest maximum penalty prescribed by the legislature short of life imprisonment. Although it could not be seriously suggested that this particular instance of the offence required anything near the maximum sentence provided, the sentencing court must bear in mind that the maximum penalty is a reflection of the seriousness with which the public through the legislature considers the type of criminal conduct with which it is concerned: H (1980) 3 A Crim R 53 at 65. It is through the maximum penalty that the legislature manifests its policy and it is the initial consideration when determining the appropriate sentence: Oliver (1980) 7 A Crim R 174 at 177. 
      
       
     12 On the face of it a sentence of two years when considered against a maximum penalty of 25 years indicates that the offence committed was very much at the lowest rung of an offence coming within s 33. 
      
       
     13 The jury’s finding that the respondent acted with the intention of inflicting grievous bodily harm reduces, although it does not eliminate, the effect of some of the matters that might reduce the objective gravity of the offence had the respondent been sentenced for an offence of malicious wounding simpliciter. For example, it does not seem to me to be a matter of very great mitigation that the wound was inflicted by a single blow when that blow was delivered with the particular intention found by the jury. Further, the fact that the wound was caused by a sharp instrument being drawn across the victim’s neck with significant force indicates that the type of harm intended was very grave indeed. It should also be noted that the respondent did not cease his attack voluntarily but was pulled away from the victim by others. 
      
       
     14 So too the importance of the fact that the offence occurred without significant premeditation is diminished, in my view, by the intention with which the wound was inflicted. The respondent deliberately armed himself with broken glass either before or during his attack upon the victim. He was prepared to use a weapon capable of inflicting life-threatening injuries with the intention of inflicting really serious injury on a person who was unarmed and virtually unable to defend himself from such an attack. 
      
       
     15 The respondent had shown no remorse or contrition, defiantly maintaining his innocence during the sentencing proceedings. Although he was not to be punished more severely because he continued to deny his guilt, he could not expect or receive any of the considerations that would have followed a plea of guilty and an acceptance of responsibility for what he had done. Thus he was to receive the full measure of the sentence that was appropriate to his crime and his subjective circumstances. 
      
       
     16 Judge Karpin told the respondent during the sentencing hearing that it would be a “most remarkable occurrence” if he were able to remain out of prison. She explained that the attitude of the courts and the legislature was that people who inflicted injuries of the nature of those suffered by the victim must expect to go to prison. Her Honour was, with respect, clearly correct in her assessment of the situation facing the respondent when he appeared before her. During the course of her remarks on sentence, her Honour stated that the objective gravity of the offence called for a full time custodial sentence. She also said that it was an offence of considerable violence which, on its face, could only be adequately punished by a term of full time imprisonment. Again, with respect, her Honour was accurate in her assessment of the sentence required. The question then is, why did her Honour not impose such a sentence? 
      
       
     17 The respondent was unrepresented when he came before the court for sentence. This was a circumstance that caused Judge Karpin some concern because of the seriousness of the offence for which he was to be punished. In the course of her remarks, her Honour said that it was impossible not to feel that, if the respondent had been represented, some material may have been elicited which would have assisted him. But it is difficult to see how the respondent was prejudiced by his lack of representation or what more could have been placed before her Honour. The respondent presented a substantial case in mitigation including a number of references from persons in the community. A very favourable pre-sentence report was before the court. Because of his denial of responsibility for the wounding, little could have been said by him or on his behalf to mitigate the circumstances of the offence, other than that which was apparent from the objective facts. However, the respondent did tell her Honour that he was astounded by the horrific injuries suffered by the victim although he did not inflict them. 
      
       
     18 The material before her Honour revealed the following subjective circumstances. The respondent was aged 26 years at the time of sentence and had no previous criminal record of any kind. He was married and lived with his wife and her three young children for whom he cared as if they were his own. Unfortunately, because of the disapproval of the marriage by his parents, the respondent was alienated from his own parents. However, he was committed to his wife and family. The respondent has always been in stable paid employment. He held trade qualifications but was furthering his studies. He was actively involved in voluntary service in the community. He had been commended by the NSW Fire Service for his actions in entering a burning building to rescue an elderly occupant. The respondent was held in high regard in the community and considered to be hardworking, reliable and trustworthy. The probation officer’s inquiries revealed him to be a responsible member of the community who was aware of the necessity of complying with the law. 
      
       
     19 In light of this subjective material her Hour stated: 
      
       
        
         
         The prisoner is entitled to call in aid his previous excellent character, his demonstration of commitment to family and community and even the sustained act of bravery some years ago which saved the life of another. Whatever led him to what he actually did, I have little doubt that he has been effectively deterred from similar conduct in the future, none the less he must be punished for his wrongdoing and a sentence must be imposed which will have a tendency to deter him and others in the community from committing similar acts of violence. 
         
        
       
       
       Her Honour concluded that the offence was “one breach in an otherwise exemplary life”. She stated that the fact that the offence was out of character when taken together with other subjective material called for a degree of leniency. 
        
       
     20 Before considering whether the sentence imposed was erroneous and, if so, how the Court should respond to that finding, it is important to recognise and reaffirm the limitations placed upon this Court by the principles that govern the determination of a Crown appeal against sentence and the exercise of the discretion that resides in this Court. The Court must have regard to the width of the discretionary judgment of the sentencing court and the limitations upon the power to review that judgment. The Court can interfere only if it is necessary to correct error and then only in an appropriate case, bearing in mind that a Crown appeal should be rarely successful where no particular error can be identified. 
      
       
     21 As I have indicated earlier the Crown’s basic submission is that the sentence does not reflect the objective seriousness of the offence and hence is outside the range of sentences that it was open to her Honour to impose within the exercise of her discretion. The Crown contends that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate even without regard to the fact that the sentence was suspended. In particular the Crown asserts that her Honour did not approach the determination of a suspended sentence in the appropriate manner. 
      
       
     22 Taking the last matter first, it seems beneficial to set out my understanding of how a court should approach the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment under the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
      
       
     23 It is clear that, when sentencing an offender to a term of imprisonment under that Act, a court is required to undertake a number of steps before finally determining the appropriate sentence. Each step requires the court to consider the objective gravity of the offence balanced against the subjective circumstances of the offender, but it is the first of those considerations that will principally determine which of the available sentencing alternatives the court should adopt. This is because at the end of the day the sentence must be commensurate with the seriousness of the crime: R v Geddes (1936) 36 SR(NSW) 554; R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 594. 
      
       
     24 There is a preliminary question to be addressed and, depending upon the answer to that question, two further steps may have to be undertaken before the ultimate sentence is imposed. 
      
       
     25 The preliminary question to be asked and answered is whether there are any alternatives to the imposition of a term of imprisonment. Section 5 of the Act prohibits a court from imposing a sentence of imprisonment unless the court is satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives, that no other penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. It should be noted that at this stage in the process the only consideration is whether a sentence of imprisonment should be imposed and not whether that sentence should be suspended. Notwithstanding that s 12, which provides the power to suspend a sentence, is contained in Division 3 of Part 2 of the Act under the general heading “Non-custodial Alternatives”, a suspended sentence is not an alternative to which s 5 relates: JCE (2000) 120 A Crim R 18 at [15]. That is because a sentence cannot be suspended until it has been imposed: it is the execution of the sentence that is suspended not its imposition. 
      
       
     26 Having determined that there is no other penalty appropriate other than a sentence of imprisonment, the court is next to determine what the term of that sentence should be; R v Foster [2001] NSWCCA 215 at [30]. This has been regarded as the first step of a two-step approach in the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment, see R v Blackman and Walters [2001] NSWCCA 121 at [50] to [52]; JCE at [17]. The determination of the term is to be made without regard to whether the sentence will be immediately served or the manner in which it is to be served. This is because any of the alternatives available in respect of a sentence of imprisonment can only be considered once the sentence has been imposed, see s 6 (periodic detention order), s 7 (home detention order) and s 12. It follows that the term of the sentence cannot be influenced by what order might be made after the sentence has been imposed. For example it cannot be increased because it is to be served by way of periodic detention: R v Wegener [1999] NSWCCA 405, or by home detention: R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 249. Nor can the term be reduced because an otherwise appropriate alternative is unavailable: R v T (NSWCCA, 19 June 1995). 
      
       
     27 The fact that a term of a sentence is to be determined without regard to the fact that it is to be suspended is consistent with the approach adopted in other jurisdictions where that sentencing alternative has been available for many years, see R v Percy [1975] Tas SR 62 at 73; Stevens v Giersh (1976) 14 SASR 81 at 82; Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 346 per Kirby J. 
      
       
     28 Once the term of the sentence has been determined the court is then to consider whether any alternative to full-time imprisonment is available in respect of that term and whether any available alternative should be utilised. The availability of an alternative to full-time custody will generally be governed by the length of the term that has been determined subject to the restrictions or pre-conditions imposed by the legislature on a particular sentencing alternative, see for example s 77 of the Act with respect to home detention. But the appropriateness of an alternative to full time custody will depend on a number of factors, one of importance being whether such an alternative would result in a sentence that reflects the objective seriousness of the offence and fulfils the manifold purposes of punishment. The court in choosing an alternative to full time custody cannot lose sight of the fact that the more lenient the alternative the less likely it is to fulfil all the purposes of punishment: R v Jurisic at 250B 
      
       
     29 So in the second step, where, for example, the term chosen is one of 18 months or less the alternatives generally available would be, in escalating order of severity: an order suspending the sentence; a home detention order; a periodic detention order; full-time custody: R v LRS [2001] NSWCCA 338 per Sully J at [65]. Of course the court has a discretion as to which of the available alternatives is chosen, but that discretion must be exercised according to established sentencing principles. 
      
       
     30 Having determined the appropriate sentence, the court must explain the sentence imposed and this may require in an appropriate case some discussion of the alternatives available and why a particular alternative has been chosen: JCE at [19]. But it is unnecessary that a sentencing court expressly state that it has applied these two steps in arriving at the sentence imposed: R v Foster at [33]. In particular, merely because a court has not expressly indicated that it has taken the two-step approach to the determination of a sentence of imprisonment it does not follow that it has failed to carry out the sentencing exercise in this manner: R v Saldaneri [2001] NSWCCA 480 at [14]. However, the nature of the sentence imposed and the failure to record that a two-step approach has been taken may lead this Court to examine carefully the findings made by the sentencing judge to determine whether the sentence is erroneous: R v Foster at [35]. 
      
       
     31 As s 5 of the Act recognises, the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment is a grave step for a court to take whether or not the offender’s liberty is immediately removed or curtailed. Section 5(2) requires a court, which imposes a sentence of imprisonment of 6 months or less, to indicate to the offender, and to record, its reasons for imposing such a sentence including the reasons why no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. These restrictions upon the power of a court to impose a sentence of imprisonment apply even if the sentence is suspended. A sentencing court, therefore, must recognise that a sentence of imprisonment can be a significant and effective punishment even where the execution of that sentence is suspended: JCE at [25], R v Foster at [36] where reference is made to statements to that effect in other jurisdictions. That is why, in the hierarchy of sentencing alternatives, a suspended sentence is considered as more severe than a community service order even though it may appear on its face to be less punitive. 
      
       
     32 Further, a sentencing court must approach the imposition of a sentence that is suspended on the basis that it can be a sufficiently severe form of punishment to act as a deterrent to both the general public and the particular offender. Of course it must also be recognised that the fact that the execution of the sentence is to be immediately suspended will deprive the punishment of much of its effectiveness in this regard because it is a significantly more lenient penalty than any other sentence of imprisonment. The question of whether any particular sentencing alternative, including a suspended sentence, is an appropriate or adequate form of punishment must be considered on a case by case basis, having regard to the nature of the offence committed, the objective seriousness of the criminality involved, the need for general or specific deterrence and the subjective circumstances of the offender. It is perhaps trite to observe that, although the purpose of punishment is the protection of the community, that purpose can be achieved in an appropriate case by a sentence designed to assist in the rehabilitation of the offender at the expense of deterrence, retribution and denunciation. In such a case a suspended sentence may be particularly effective and appropriate. 
      
       
     33 In the present case Judge Karpin came to the view that the objective circumstances called for a full-time gaol sentence in order to punish the respondent for what he did and to deter him and others from like conduct in the future. As against a maximum penalty of 25 years and where the respondent had gone to trial and denied his responsibility for what her Honour described as “considerable violence”, her Honour determined that an appropriate sentence to reflect the objective seriousness of the offence was two years imprisonment. Notwithstanding the strong subjective features of the case, that sentence was manifestly inadequate even before regard is had to the fact that the sentence was suspended. 
      
       
     34 I acknowledge that her Honour was faced with a difficult task in that it is never easy to impose a full time sentence of imprisonment upon a young man of the character and disposition of the respondent. That is particularly so when the offender himself stands before the court unrepresented and makes the plea on his own behalf. But it is inescapable, in my view, that her Honour allowed the subjective matters, as powerful as they were, to obscure a proper evaluation of what the respondent had done and the nature of the offence for which he had been convicted. 
      
       
     35 The Crown has submitted that her Honour must have elided the two steps, to which I have referred above, and having determined that a suspended sentence was appropriate imposed a sentence to achieve that result. Having regard to what her Honour said to the respondent during his submissions on sentence and her acknowledgment of the seriousness of the offence and the importance of general deterrence, it is difficult to come to any other conclusion other than that her Honour determined to suspend any sentence imposed because she did not wish to send the respondent into full-time custody. 
      
       
     36 There is nothing in her Honour’s reasons to indicate why a suspended sentence was chosen as the appropriate order to make in respect of the sentence of imprisonment imposed. Her Honour makes no reference to suspending the sentence until the order is made. As I have indicated earlier, it is not always necessary for a sentencing court to explain why a particular sentencing alternative is chosen. But in the present case, her Honour having indicated to the respondent that “it would be a most remarkable occurrence” if he stayed out of prison, it is not unreasonable to expect that her Honour would have explained why that occurrence was justified in the respondent’s case. Her Honour having acknowledged that the objective gravity of the offence called for a full-time custodial sentence merely indicated that leniency was warranted by his subjective circumstances and because the offence was uncharacteristic. Leniency was warranted but not to a disproportionate degree. 
      
       
     37 In my view the subjective circumstances of the respondent could not justify the sentence imposed having regard to the offence committed: there was no need to attempt to rehabilitate the respondent, there was nothing to be served by a good behaviour bond, supervision by the probation service was not required, the respondent was unlikely to re-offend. 
      
       
     38 True it was that the offence was uncharacteristic and might be regarded as “one breach in an otherwise exemplary life”, but it was a breach of very substantial criminality and had to be met with condign punishment for all the reasons to which her Honour referred. As her Honour recognised, general deterrence was of very great importance in sentencing for this type of offence, which is unfortunately prevalent in the community. Although a suspended sentence can, in an appropriate case, adequately reflect the deterrent aspect of sentencing, it could not do so in this case, so important was that aspect of punishment by reason of the offence committed by the respondent. 
      
       
     39 In my opinion the Crown has made good its challenge to the sentence. 
      
       
     40 What then should be the result of the appeal? This is a case where double jeopardy looms large. The respondent appeared unrepresented before her Honour and ultimately left the court with what was effectively a non-custodial sentence. The probation officer reports that the respondent and his wife were experiencing considerable stress due to their concern at the outcome of the proceedings. It is difficult not to feel some sympathy for the situation of the respondent in that, having been relieved of the burden of a custodial sentence, he should face once more the possibility of such a sentence being imposed upon him, no matter how richly he deserved it. He has been subject to the uncertainty of the Crown appeal since October last year. He has been subject to the sentence imposed by her Honour since 14 August last, a period of 6 months. During that time he has been subject to supervision by the probation service. 
      
       
     41 In my view a sentence of imprisonment must now be imposed upon the respondent but not that which should have been imposed by the sentencing judge. An appropriate sentence to be imposed by this Court, bearing in mind double jeopardy, would be one of imprisonment for three years. A sentence of full-time custody should have been imposed in the District Court, notwithstanding the terrible consequences of such a sentence for the respondent and his family. However, it would now be unduly harsh to impose a full-time sentence upon him. 
      
       
     42 There was in evidence before Judge Karpin a pre-sentence report that indicated that the respondent was a suitable candidate for periodic detention. The Crown Prosecutor on the hearing of this appeal has accepted that this Court can rely upon that report and the findings of the probation officer. He has further stated that the Crown is aware of no matter which would disentitle the respondent to an order that any sentence be served by way of periodic detention. Mr Watts for the respondent has indicated that, if the Court was minded to make such an order in re-sentencing the prisoner, he had no submission to make against the Court taking that course. It seems to me now to be a proper order to make although it would not have been appropriate at first instance. 
      
       
     43 Because I propose that the respondent be sentenced to a term of imprisonment, albeit one to be served by way of periodic detention, consideration must be given to the length of the non-parole period. In my opinion, notwithstanding the respondent’s prior good record and the fact that this will be his first period in custody, there are no special circumstances justifying a reduction in the non-parole period. The sentence I propose has already been reduced by reason of double jeopardy to what is arguably an unduly lenient sentence. 
      
       
     44 I propose that the appeal be allowed and the sentence imposed in the District Court be quashed. In my opinion the sentence that should now be imposed is imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years 3 months. It is not possible to backdate the sentence but the respondent should receive the benefit of the period during which he has been subject to the good behaviour bond. The sentence and the non-parole period, therefore, should be reduced by 6 months. I propose that the respondent be sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 1 year 9 months. There should be an order that the sentence be served by way of periodic detention. The sentence is to commence on Friday 22 February 2002. The non-parole period is to expire on 21 November 2003 the date upon which the respondent is to be released to parole.

      Judgment 
       
     1 KIRBY J: Mr Robert Glenn Hoadley pleaded guilty before Armitage DCJ to an offence of having robbed Kevin Robert Taverner of a mobile phone on 16 October 2000 (s94 of the Crimes Act 2000). The maximum penalty for that offence is fourteen years. His Honour sentenced Mr Hoadley to a term of imprisonment of two years with a non parole period of one and half years. The sentence was to date from the time of Mr Hoadley’s arrest on 16 October 2000 when he was taken into custody. 
      
       
     2 The sentence was imposed on 2 March 2001. On 19 July 2001 an application for leave to appeal against the severity of that sentence was prepared. It was received by the Registry on 24 July 2001, well outside the time limited for appeal. Accordingly, Mr Hoadley seeks an extension of time as well as leave to appeal against the sentence he is now serving. 
      
       
     3 The sentencing Judge described the circumstances in which the robbery took place. At 9am on 16 October 2000 the victim, Kevin Taverner, approached an automatic teller machine in Adamstown. As he crossed the road to the Adamstown Post Office he was followed by Mr Hoadley. An argument ensued. Mr Hoadley knocked Mr Taverner to the ground, causing him to fall backwards over a small fence. It was then that Mr Hoadley noticed a mobile phone belonging to Mr Taverner. It was conceded that Mr Hoadley removed that phone by force.  
      
       
     4 As it happened the incident was observed by the police. They spoke to Mr Hoadley. The mobile phone was then found in his possession. He was then arrested and charged. 
      
       
     5 Mr Hoadley did not give evidence on sentence. However, his older brother did so. His brother described changes that he had observed in Mr Hoadley since his arrest. Mr Hoadley had, in the past, served a number of terms of imprisonment. So far as his family was concerned he had done so with an attitude of bravado and defiance. The brother of Mr Hoadley said that, on his observation, that had changed. Mr Hoadley, according to his brother, at last appeared to recognise the seriousness of his situation and the need for change. 
      
       
     6 His brother in these circumstances indicated to the court that he was prepared to assist. He was prepared to offer accommodation and employment. He had a successful earth moving business. I will return to this aspect in a moment. 
      
       
     7 Mr Hoadley’s criminal record was placed before his Honour. It is clear that at various times he has had an association with drugs. He had what his Honour termed “an extensive criminal record” mostly for offences of dishonesty, although more recently, and disturbingly, for offences which involved having a knife in a public place. He had served terms of imprisonment that had been imposed from time to time, which varied in length from one month to six months. His Honour remarked on the objective seriousness of the offence and the need to deter Mr Hoadley and others who may be tempted to commit similar offences. His Honour then imposed the terms of imprisonment to which I have referred. 
      
       
     8 In helpful written submissions made on behalf of Mr Hoadley, two issues have been raised: first, complaint is made that his Honour failed to find special circumstances under s44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and thereby alter the ratio between the head sentence and the non parole period. 
      
       
     9 Second, that in determining that issue, his Honour gave too little weight or misstated the affect of the brother’s evidence and the opportunity which was offered for rehabilitation of this offender. 
      
       
     10 It is convenient to deal with the second issue first, since it lies at the heart of the suggestion that there was an error by his Honour in failing to find special circumstances. His Honour in his remarks on sentence said: (at p3) 
      
       
        
         
         “I had regard to the evidence given today by the prisoner’s brother. It seems that there is at least some possibility and I put it no higher than that, that he has a genuine desire to mend his ways and to endeavour to gain productive employment.” 
         
        
       
     11 That was a judgment on an issue of fact, and a matter of a evaluation which was before the sentencing Judge, he having heard the evidence, having seen the brother, and noted, no doubt, that Mr Hoadley had not given evidence before him. It clearly was, in my view, a judgment open to him. The applicant had an extensive criminal record. That, no doubt, was the reason for his Honour’s cautious optimism. I see no error in his Honour’s approach. 
      
       
     12 Returning to the first issue, plainly his Honour gave consideration to the issue of special circumstances. Again, he made a judgment that the circumstances of the applicant did not amount to special circumstances for the purposes of the Act or that he would not so regard them. As recently noted in Regina v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534 para 73, there are well known constraints upon an appellate court interfering in such a determination. The view which his Honour formed was, in my opinion, open to him. I see no occasion on this material to interfere. 
      
       
     13 The order I therefore propose is that leave be granted extending the time to file the notice of appeal and leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed. 
      
       
     14 BUDDIN J: I agree. 
      
       
     15 KIRBY J: The order of the Court will be as proposed by me.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 IPP AJA: On 24 February 1999 the respondent issued a summons charging the appellant with polluting waters contrary to s 16(1) of the Clean Waters Act 1970. The summons alleged: 
      
       
        
         
         “On or about 25 February 1998 at Woolloomooloo Bay in the State of New South Wales, [the appellant] committed an offence against the  
         Environmental Offences and Penalties 
           
         Act 
          1989 in that it did pollute waters contrary to s 16(1) of the  
         Clean Waters Act 
          1970”. 
         
        
       
     2 The appellant sought an order striking out the summons. It contended before Pearlman J, the Chief Judge of the Land and Environment Court, that the summons was defective in several respects. For the purposes of these reasons it is necessary only to refer to the appellant’s argument that the summons was defective in that: 
      
       
        
         
         “It fails to set out the acts or omissions of the [appellant] which are alleged to constitute the alleged offence – in simple terms, it fails to disclose what the defendant did which is alleged to be wrong”. 
         
        
       
     3 On 20 May 1999 Pearlman J delivered a judgment in which she rejected the appellant’s argument. 
      
       
     4 By judgment delivered 13 September 2000 (McConnell Dowell Constructors (Aust) Pty Ltd v Environment Protection Authority (No. 1) (2000) 50 NSWLR 127 this Court held that Pearlman J had erred as the summons did not identify an act of polluting which is an essential factual ingredient of the offence. 
      
       
     5 In so deciding, the Court did not consider the question whether an act of polluting was a legal element of the offence. This was not a question that the court was required to address. Nor did the court consider s 43 of the Land and Environment Court Act 1979. Spigelman CJ observed (at 134): 
      
       
        
         
          “The applicability of s 43 of the Land and Environment Court Act is a matter for further consideration in that Court”. 
         
        
       
     6 Thereafter, the question of the operation of s 43 arose before Pearlman J when the appellant, by way of notice of motion, sought an order that the summons be struck out as invalid or, alternatively, an order that the proceedings be permanently stayed. The crisp issue before her Honour was whether s 43 operated so as to cure the defect identified by this Court. 
      
       
     7 Section 43 provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “No objection shall be taken or allowed to any application referred to in, or to any order or warrant made or issued under, s 41 or 42 by reason of any alleged defect in it in substance or in form or by reason of any variance between it and the evidence adduced at the proceedings for the offence charged in the application or order”. 
          
         
        
       
     8 In the subsequent hearing before Pearlman J, the appellant submitted that the omission to allege an act of polluting on the part of the appellant was fatal as such an act was an essential legal element of the offence alleged and therefore could not be cured by the application of s 43. Pearlman J did not accept this argument. She held that the summons should not be dismissed and the proceedings should not be permanently stayed.  
      
       
     9 The appellant repeats its contentions before this Court. It seeks an order that the determinations made by Pearlman J on 20 June 2001 be set aside and the proceedings against it be dismissed. 
      
       
     10 In Taylor v Environment Protection Authority (2000) 50 NSWLR 48 Sperling J (with whom Meagher JA and James J agreed) said at (57): 
      
       
        
         
         “Section 43 of the  
         Land 
           
         and 
           
         Environment Court Act 
          1979 provides, so far as is material, that no objection shall be taken or allowed to any application (ie the summons) referred to in, or to an order made under s 41, by reason of any alleged defect in it in substance or in form. This is what is known as a  
         Lord Jervis 
          provision. Similar provisions are to be found in the  
         Justices Act 
           
         1902, ss 30 and 65. 
         
        
        
         
         A distinction is drawn between informations which fail to specify the legal elements of the offence and those where essential factual particulars have not been given. Where an information fails to specify the essential legal elements of the offence, the information is not saved by a  
         Lord Jervis

Accordingly, the question in this appeal is whether the omission of an allegation detailing the act of polluting said to have caused the pollution renders the charge fatally defective so as to preclude the curative effect of s 43.  
      
       
     12 The answer to that question depends, in turn, on whether the act of polluting is a legal element of the offence or merely an essential factual ingredient thereof. That is because a charge that omits a legal element of the offence is incurable, whereas, by reason of s 43, a charge that lacks an essential factual ingredient of the offence may still be maintained. 
      
       
     13 The authorities do not provide a test for identifying and differentiating between the legal elements and the essential factual ingredients of an offence. It is generally accepted, however, that the legal elements consist of the matters that, as a matter of law, must be established for the offence to be made out; and the essential factual ingredients concern the time, place and manner in which the offence was committed. But putting the difference in this way does not necessarily help in the differentiation process. 
      
       
     14 I think it helpful to note that the purpose of the rule that requires the legal elements of the law to be pleaded in a charge is to require the prosecution to satisfy the court that it has jurisdiction to entertain the criminal proceedings initiated by the charge: Ex parte Lovell; re Buckley (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 153; 55 WN (NSW) 63. If the charge does not allege an offence known to the law, the court has no jurisdiction and the charge must be struck out. 
      
       
     15 The legal elements of a particular offence will ordinarily be constant. In this way the legal elements differ from the essential factual ingredients. The main purpose of the rule that requires the essential factual ingredients of an offence to be provided is to inform the defendant of the case he or she has to meet: Stanton v Abernathy (1990) 19 NSWLR 656. Thus, the legal elements of the one charge may be proved in more than one way – by differing sets of essential factual ingredients. 
      
       
     16 This case concerns a statutory offence. The elements of a statutory offence must be discerned from the relevant statutory provisions. In the present instance, these are ss 16(1) and (7a) of the Clean Waters Act. Section 16(1) provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “A person shall not pollute any waters”. 
         
        
       
       
       Section 16(7) provides that any person who contravenes the provisions of s 16 is guilty of an offence under the  
       Environmental Offences and 
         
       Penalties Act 
        1989.  
        
       
     17 Significantly, the term “pollute”, in relation to waters, is defined by the Clean Waters Act (s 5). The definition contains three paragraphs, each of which provides for a different meaning of pollute. Paragraph (a) provides, generally, that pollute means to introduce into waters any matter so that “the physical, chemical or biological condition of the waters is changed”. Paragraph (b) contains a complex definition that broadens the meaning of pollute so that it means (in summary form) to introduce into waters matter which alone or together with other matter makes or is likely to make the waters unclean, etc, detrimental to health of persons, undrinkable to farm animals or is likely to interfere with the enjoyment of rights. Paragraph (c) provides that pollute means to introduce into waters any matter that is of a prescribed nature, description or class that does not comply with a prescribed standard. The latter, in effect, is a deemed polluting. 
      
       
     18 It follows that there are several ways in which a person may pollute waters, namely, the ways defined in the statutory definition of “pollute. That being so, it seems to me, by the language of the statute, the relevant legal element of the offence is the act of “polluting”, as defined, of waters. The particular way in which the defendant is alleged to have polluted the waters concerned will constitute the essential factual ingredients of the charge.  
      
       
     19 In Brownlie v State Pollution Control Commission (1992) 27 NSWLR 78 Gleeson CJ said at 83 that an offence of contravening s 16(1) requires the prosecution to prove that the defendant performed some act which resulted in waters being polluted (see also Environment Protection Authority v Bathurst City Council (1995) 89 LGERA 79 at 82). This, I think, is on the basis that the prosecution relies on “pollute” as defined in either one of paras (a) or (b). The need to prove these matters stems from the statutory definition of “pollute”. The existence of the need, however, does not convert these matters into legal elements of the offence. In my view, they are and remain essential factual ingredients of the legal element of “pollute” in the offence of contravening s 16(1).  
      
       
     20 Accordingly, in my view, the elements of the offence are: 
      
       
       
       (a) a polluting; 
        
        
       (b) by a person; 
        
        
       (c) of any waters. 
        
       
     21 The charge alleges these three elements. Therefore, the language of the charge, on its face, describes an offence known to the law, namely, a contravention of s 16(1). The court is thereby vested with jurisdiction to hear the prosecution of that offence. 
      
       
     22 In a case where the prosecution relies on a polluting that falls within para (a) or para (b) of the definition of pollute, it will have to prove both an act of polluting and the consequence of pollution. Both these matters make up the defined meaning of pollute.  
      
       
     23 On first principles, therefore, I would hold that the charge in the summons alleges all the legal elements of an offence consisting of a contravention of s 16(1) and I would dismiss the appeal on that basis.  
      
       
     24 In the appellant’s written submissions it relied on an observation by Spigelman CJ in McConnell Dowell Constructors (Aust) Pty Ltd v Environment Protection Authority (No 1) (at 134) that: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Both the 
          polluting  
         and  
         pollution  
         are essential ingredients of the offence under s 16”. 
         
        
       
     25 In the appellant’s written submissions it submitted further that “both the pollution and the polluting are essential ingredients required to make out an offence under s16”. The written submissions repeated that “being a result offence there is need to specify the acts and omissions of both pollution and polluting, such particulars being essential legal ingredients of the offence”. In this context, by “essential legal ingredients” the appellant meant legal elements. 
      
       
     26 I would pause to observe, firstly, that an offence of contravening s 16(1) that is based on polluting in terms of para (c) of the definition of pollute is not a result offence. Whether the offence with which the appellant is charged involves polluting in terms of para (c) or some other form of polluting is not yet known. This can be made clear by the provision of particulars. For the purposes of the issue raised in this appeal it is sufficient that the charge alleges the legal element of polluting. Secondly, I would note that the term “result offence” is merely a convenient description of a category of offences and it does not give rise to special rules of its own.  
      
       
     27 It is necessary to refer in some detail to the reasons of Spigelman CJ in McConnell Dowell Constructors (Aust) Pty Ltd v Environment Protection Authority (No 1) so that his remarks, so relied on by the appellant, can be seen in context.  
      
       
     28 His Honour referred to Taylor v Environment Protection Authority where Sperling J at (134) pointed out that the summons in that case specified the legal elements of the offence but did not specify the acts or omissions by which the defendant was alleged to have committed the offence. The learned Chief Justice then said, “In my opinion, some reference to the conduct, apparently of the defendant’s subcontractor, said to constitute the act of polluting was required in the summons … “ Later Spigelman CJ said “Both the polluting and pollution are essential ingredients of the offence under s 16. The charge in this case referred only to the pollution.” 
      
       
     29 As Spigelman CJ made clear in his reasons, the fact that the appellant was alleged to be vicariously liable “was not an ingredient of the offence at all”. In my respectful view, it is plain from his Honour’s reasons as a whole that, by the word “ingredient” in this sentence, he meant “legal element”. The learned Chief Justice’s comment that some reference to the conduct of the appellant’s subcontractor (said to constitute the act of polluting) was, nevertheless, required in the summons was therefore an observation that such a reference was needed to explain the manner in which the offence was said to have been committed. The failure to allege the manner of the commission of the offence meant that there was an essential factual ingredient missing from the charge. This conclusion is supported by his Honour’s earlier reference to Sperling J’s remarks (at 134) in Taylor v Environment Protection Authority 
      
       
     30 As regards the second observation of the Chief Justice relied on by the appellant, it is necessary to note that the charge contained particulars of the pollutants said to have been used and the waters said to have been polluted. Thus, when his Honour said that both the polluting and pollution were essential ingredients of the offence under s 16 and observed that the charge referred only to the pollution, he was referring to the fact that particulars had been given of the pollution but not of the act of polluting. Thus, he was referring again to the essential factual ingredients that were required, not to the legal elements. These conclusions are borne out by the order made by the Court in McConnell Dowell Constructors (Aust) Pty Ltd v Environment Protection Authority (No 1) to the effect that the summons did not identify an act of polluting which is an essential factual ingredient of the offence.  
      
       
     31 Accordingly, in my view, McConnell Dowell Constructors (Aust) Pty Ltd v Environment Protection Authority (No 1) does not assist the appellant. Indeed the contrary is the case. In my opinion, while the charge in the summons omitted essential factual ingredients from the charge, as was held in McConnell Dowell Constructors (Aust) Pty Ltd v Environment Protection Authority (No 1), it did not omit any of the essential legal elements.  
      
       
     32 Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal. 
      
       
     33 KIRBY J: I too would dismiss the appeal for reasons given by the presiding judge. 
      
       
     34 HOWIE J: I also agree. 
      
       
     35 IPP AJA: The orders of the Court will be: 
      
       
       
       (1) Appeal dismissed. 
        
        
       (2) The Court affirms the order made by Pearlman J on 20 June 2001 dismissing the appellant’s notice of motion filed on 15 June 2001.
